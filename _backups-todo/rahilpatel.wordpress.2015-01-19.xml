Herro, again.

I'm Rahil.

And this is my website. It's kinda like my bedroom: a mess, until reason arises. On this site you can see <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/portfolio">things I've done</a> and <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/blog">things I've written</a>.

Lifelong goals: to influence people to interact with people nearby, as opposed to media, as a way of gaining knowledge through experience, and to stop and remind people that a new, satisfying experience isn't far.

How:
Use new media in public spaces to encourage interaction and offer knowledge (sometimes through social criticism), for functional and artistic purposes.

Possible lifestyles:
1. Live in a developing area. Work at an empowerment organization. <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/diy-ethics-in-developing-countries" title="DIY Ethics in Developing Countries">Use local materials and life for inspiration to create stuff</a> (functional and artistic) while working.
2. Live in or near a <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/new-york-and-taiwan" title="New York and Taiwan">post-modern city</a>. Work at an <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/urban-planning-for-solidarity" title="Urban Planning for Solidarity">urban planning</a> / <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/decision-making-civics-and-technology" title="Decision-making, Civics, and Technology">civic engagement</a> / design related place, regularly participate at a local community development place, and remember to take trips out of the city!

Possible next moves:
1. Build a house in nature for myself, with very cheap land rent, to distance self from society's problems. Use the experience to build minimalist shelters in the future.
2. Teach in the most progressive, lenient environment.
3. Learn everything there is about Taiwan by constantly traveling and talking to people. Also reading a history book or two about it. Could start Humans of Taiwan for this again, using it as a platform to create a reality for the nation.
*. Always think about design and technology and civic engagement and decision-making in general, to where it changes reality.

a thought from Japan:
<blockquote>At NTT ICC: Audio tapes slowly unwinds slowly above a beautiful pillar, when the unwinding ends, it winds and plays, revealing the audio track, and the fact that sound was playing the entire time. A very Braid feel.
</blockquote>

I found <a href="http://www.ntticc.or.jp/Archive/2013/Openspace2013/Works/Toki_Ori_Ori_Nasu_ver_2.html">it</a> on the internet!

points:
school provides an environment make mistakes, but is not interesting as practical use, and is likely not as interesting as talking to people in real life

it's best to just quickly go over flash cards and grammar, then try to use them in real life. One use the grammar book's activities which repeat the vocab and existing knowledge, but what's the point? One should do the same with new grammar, as there may be several ways to to use the new grammar, and check with someone who knows the language.

also a grammar book to quickly go through all the uses of grammar.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[These are my overclocking results with a MSI P6N SLI Platinum with a Core 2 Duo E6420 (and a XIGMATEK HDT-S1283 120mm Rifle CPU Cooler).

how to OC:
increment FSB. if that doesn't work, increment voltage and try again. keep FSB 1:1 to MEM	
in my case, FSB/2 = MEM
when done, prime95 blend test, prime95 small FFTs, intel burn test (very intense!)

BIOS settings:
1) cpu feature
execute bit support	disabled
set limit CPUID		disabled
c1e			disabled	press f4 in this menu

2) chipset feature
HPET			disabled

3) cell menu
D.O.T.			disabled
EIST			disabled
system clock		manual		
	voltages	(see below)
advanced DRAM...	4-4-4-12tRAS-auto tRC-2T @ auto voltage (g.skills were auto'd at 2-3-3-8 @ 375mhz [although i put 4-3-3-8-auto(17)-auto(2t)-auto(1.9)?])
spread spectrum 	disable CPU
CPU ratio				8

results:
before wall
voltages
	FSB	1500
	MEM	750
	CPU	0.000 (stock)
	NB	1.3v (+.05)
	SB	1.5v (stock)
	FSB VTT	0% (stock)

after wall
advanced DRAM...	auto
voltages
	FSB	1700
	MEM	850
	CPU	+.750
	NB	+.2	1.45v
	SB	stock
	FSB VTT	4%

how to flash:
C:
cd\flash
A7350NMS.150
Afud408.exe /P /B /C

GPU				temp after 2 mins of ATI tool artifact test
default		513/792		77 (60 idle)
OC	600/900
		625/1000	80c
		650/1000	83c
		675/1000	[fail?]

1 hour ati tool artifact is a good test

using ATI tool
	find max core - freezes at 669
	find max mem - freezes at 1156]]></content:encoded>

		<title>What five months in a house can do</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In my <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/creativity-external-stimuli-cities-and-suburbs" title="Creativity, External Stimuli, Cities, and Suburbs">"Creativity, External Stimuli, Cities, and Suburbs</a> post, I go at length explaining a personal philosophy of something close to materialism and Dewey's aesthetics.

After a long period of nomadism and travel, I finally spent time in one place: my parent's house. I ended up here because I came back to America to attend some weddings, and perhaps attend school. I decided against the latter part.

How my mind transformed from extreme creativity to extreme oversleeping is pretty fascinating experiment, like studying the effects of prison on prisoners, and it serves as a lesson of personal human nature. I don't know if this applies for everyone, but perhaps artist personalities, and my mom.

First two weeks:

Two weeks to a month:

Second month:

Third month:

Fourth month:


Other thoughts:
What's frightening is the fact that I stayed so long. I kept telling myself I just need to sell my stuff, but I could have done that through a garage sale in the first to weeks. I could have been much more active about it. There's definitely a passive element about selling things online. It's like having a store and waiting for people to buy your things.

I also had what I called the "thoughts project", which is <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/valuable-things-ive-written" title="Valuable Things I’ve Written">basically everything I've written during the past few months</a>, and involves naive philosophical analysis of my own past. <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/no-more-writing" title="No more writing">Unnecessary</a>, but oh well now.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>Morning depression. It occurs when one does not get out of the house in the morning. Most people walk, jog, exercise, commute. I like to explore. Without satisfying this psychological need, one can become depressed, especially when living alone. Over-think what t odo or where to go. One should just go, get out of the house. Cities are nice as one does not have to walk far to encounter people [an experience]. Asia works well too, with its scooters. The suburbs can be troublesome, as there are few public spaces to go to.

As soon as I went outside the house, into the the light, I felt better. Light is important.

Local projects.

Today I wasted away. Not enough local interaction. The problem of being a lone independent gamer emerges: I crumb when I am working alone. It is the same problem encountered when Jon was here. We were deprived of friends. So we abounded the game idea and created a game workshop.

I do not think today was a waste. It’s progress. Thinking about what I want to do next.</blockquote>

<blockquote>When working mode, I give up time so easily, not actively thinking why, just working.</blockquote>

Experience and not experiencing.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>Perhaps I chose the wrong direction, or I should have moved on immediately. [shouldn’t have chosen to stop at a house]

The towns in Nepal and Darjeeling are easy to explore and social. They’re small with tons of cafes, nice surroundings, and cool weather. I also live in the city, so I go out more, build routine with local shops, do everything outside — eat, laundry, internet cafe, tea, and work. In Baroda, I do everything inside. That’s the difference. I need to live outside. Or, perhaps, In red to live with people [that I want to partake in activities with].</blockquote>



<blockquote>Still thinking about why my time in Nepal and Darjeeling felt so great compared to Baroda. In those areas I spent my first six to eight hours outside. I talked to the hostel owners, travelers, local people, and was more open to talk to people, to meet people. I planned to go out somewhere once a day. I still wake up late, but it was okay. I spent every sunlight hour under it. Even at night in Darjeeling, I’d spend an hour or two at a bar because I wanted to be with people. It felt good. I did my work at night.

In baroda, I lost my activity, motivation to do things very early. I could go to Mt. Abu, or other surrounding areas. I could meet people. I could be outside, although, I can’t work on a laptop outside because it is too hot, and the cafes are expensive, and just not very local. I could see farms, learn to farm, do some yoga, eat at local gujarati thali places, explore the city, explore the surroundings, making one day trip per day, but I didn’t. I was too focused on work, my next direction, that I lived less, not seizing the moment. Stuck at the house doing meaningless things.</blockquote>



<blockquote>I’ve been in the house for too many hours. I always compare to how much life I lied in Nepal and Darjeeling. I need to be outside the house for as many hours as possible. I need to live for the first hour of the day, like Vidya, take a hike to a temple. I’m not as alert as I was before. My work is at the house, and it is killing me. I need to be like Fred. Live several lives per day. I have to keep walking and talking around town. Keep consuming, meeting people, and working.</blockquote>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Animals try to survive. Once survival is easy enough, they try to create.

In some societies, survival is life (developing countries), in others, it is given (developed countries, at least agriculture).

If one believes in materialism, and moves to the other, will that person adapt to the other values? Meaning, can people's values adjust from self-expression to survival and back?

When a middle class person from a place with self-expression values goes to a place of survival values for a long period of time, it's quite possible for the person to change. For example, when people go to the army. They experience severe depression and are sometimes unable to adjust back.

When a young person from a place with survival values goes to a place with self-expression value, they seem to have a appreciation for both. I've encountered a lot of great kids throughout Asia with creativity. They create, but many use their creativity to do good toward society, as opposed to more capitalistic reasons.

When an old person from a place with survival values goes to a place with self-expression value, say Asian immigrants, it's rare they show much self-expression. They simply provide security for family and life. If money is left, it goes to comfort. No further thought is put into it. I still have no idea what elderly successful Asian Americans do.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Night Markets as entrepreneurship:
Towards the end of the Tang Dynasty, economic expansion led to less state regulation and restrictions being lifted on Night Markets. During the Song Dynasty (960-1279), Night Markets played a central role in Chinese nightlife. These markets were found in corners of large cities. Some stayed open for twenty- four hours. Song period Night Markets are also known to have included restaurants and brothels due to being frequently located near business districts and red light districts.

The serving of xiaochi foods attracted Taiwan's local elite. Stories were formed of how well-known politicians and intellectuals visited Night Market stalls.

Night Markets started to embody the local and the global modern popular culture because of commercial industries. Because of the global recession in the 1970s, canceled imports created more opportunities for vendors selling light industry and family made goods. This was due to more products becoming available to local markets. Night Marketing Networks were formed and sold Taiwan's light industry goods.

Night Markets changed from places that sold traditional snack food and handicrafts to modern centers of popular culture. Markets rapidly responded to new trends by producing their own versions of popular goods, especially in the 1990s, when copyright and intellectual property laws were only loosely enforced.]]></content:encoded>

<blockquote>"Taiwan feels it goes further though. I can go to other cities, towns, or farms, beautiful natural places. This is because Taiwan has a fantastic train system that goes around the country at every hour, whereas the public transportation of America is limited to the metro system and infrequent buses with no stops on the coasts.The train has a huge enabling effect. I have a friend who works on in one city and commutes to another one-quarter across the island. It was very easy for me to move to another city and work. There’s a feeling that one could work anywhere on the island, save the mountains in the middle, because of it, and people do. Many people in Taipei school or work for a short period, or even commute from other cities everyday. Low-cost trains have such a strong effect that I bet if America was linked by trains, the suburbs would have died much quicker, having people move into cities.*"</blockquote>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[How does civic engagement look like in an autonomist society?

Unlike other forms of Marxism, autonomist Marxism emphasises the ability of the working class to force changes to the organization of the capitalist system independent of the state, trade unions or political parties. Autonomists are less concerned with party political organization than are other Marxists, focusing instead on self-organized action outside of traditional organizational structures. Autonomist Marxism is thus a "bottom-up" theory: it draws attention to activities that autonomists see as everyday working-class resistance to capitalism, for example absenteeism, slow working, and socialization in the workplace.

Economics is seen as being entirely political; economic relations are direct political relations of force between class subjects. And it is in the economic category of the social worker, not in an alienated political form like the party, that the initiative for political change resides.

How do people engage in civics now?

How do people experience the city?

Does media even matter?

Can media be linked to active participation?

How can they?]]></content:encoded>

Or socially die.

When a person is socially detached from nuclear family and institutions in a suburban or similar environment, the person has no other society to be part of.

The city is a society, which may be viewed as the form of a institution or family.

		<title>Save your Netflix ratings</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I have a data whoring personality. I have way to many things-to-do lists, and text files with data which can be easily found on the internet. I'm trying to move away from this, yet I still persist.

Previously, to download my Netflix Ratings I used to use a <a title="script" href="http://tenhanna.com/greasemonkey/" target="_self">script</a> in Greasemonkey, but that didn't work this time. After some Googling, I found <a title="LikeMinds" href="http://www.likeminds.com/" target="_self">LikeMinds</a> (SaveMyRatings).

<em>"LikeMinds is a service for sharing your favorites and discovering new stuff; including movies, books, music, people and places, with the help of other like-minded people.</em>

<em>LikeMinds also allows you to share your ratings with friends by quickly copying your ratings from different websites including Netflix, Blockbuster, Amazon, Flixster, Yahoo, IMDB, RottenTomates , iTunes, Winamp, GoodReads, Shelfari and many more websites and applications."</em>

I signed up and was able to import my Netflix ratings to the LikeMinds server, but I had trouble finding how to import it to a local file. Then I found this <a title="link" href="http://app.likeminds.com/facebook/user/0/movies/ratings/export/?lmref=lm_blog" target="_self">link</a>. I had to log into Facebook for some reason, but it worked!

<a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/netflix.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5" title="My Netflix ratings in Excel" src="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/netflix.png" alt="" width="1007" height="868" /></a>

LikeMinds saves your ratings into a CSV file, which can be opened with Excel, then easily manipulated to however you like.

There were some errors. Some foreign movie titles contained weird characters. I even found a movie I can't find on Netflix--"Wild, Wild West: The Steel Assassin" from 1999! Regardless, my storage greedy personality was satisifed.

I went even further adding friends similar to me, which resulted with a list of "movies new to you that your 19 LikeMinds rated highly".

<a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/LikeMinds.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9" title="LikeMinds" src="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/LikeMinds.png" alt="" width="998" height="870" /></a>

This list already seemed far more useful than any recommendations I've received from Netflix! Now if only I rated all of my music...]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Exit Through the Gift Shop</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Before watching <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Exit Through the Gift Shop</span>, I gathered from various snippets that it was movie instead of a documentary. I normally fall asleep on documentaries. To keep me awake, the documentary has to be more than a typical documentary that provides knowledge about a subject. It has to have some movie elements to keep it compelling throughout, like the thrill of “Man on Wire” or the cinematography of “Food Inc.”. Gladly it was more.

I’m interested in all types of art and media: films, comics, fashion, whatever. As long as it seems like the creator tried to create something original, I’m happy to observe. Street Art is no different. I’ve only glimpsed at some popular street art on the internet. I can’t recall exactly how, but a likely example would be: a friend instant messages me <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuGaqLT-gO4">a stop motion animated film by blu</a>, then I Wikipedia him, which leads to more Wikipedia articles, and eventually I find Banksy and Shepard Fairy, among others.

It did well on metacritic, Ebert liked it (my ratings are similar to his), and the Netflix summary on the DVD case cover was very appealing to me.

“<em>Filmmaker Thierry Guetta had been casually documenting the underground world of street art for years, but when he encounters Banksy, an elusive British stencil artist, his project takes a fascinating twist. Unimpressed with Guetta's footage, Banksy takes over filmmaking duties and Guetta reinvents himself as a street artist named Mr. Brainwash -- and, much to Banksy's surprise, immediately becomes a darling of the Los Angeles art scene.</em><em>”</em>

On to the movie…

The movie itself is very good. The main character felt real, background knowledge about modern street art is given, questions are asked.

The main character, Thierry Guetta, is a French guy who has, since childhood, filmed—err video recording—everything in life. When he starts taping his street artist cousin, Invader, he really gets into it. He goes out at night on rooftops to record Invader, and soon more famous people, notably, Banksy.

Banksy is a modern famous street artist, possibly helped by the anonymity of himself, but still a legit artist. When it comes time for Thierry to create a film out of the hundreds of unlabeled tapes in storage, he fails. The film stinks, because Thierry is not a filmmaker, nor an artist. Banksy takes over, creating the film being watched, while Thierry goes on to make his own art.

Thierry goes on to create a showcase similar to the one he recorded for Banksy. He hires a ton of people, morally good, hard-working people. Emulating the styles of the artists he recorded, his showcase becomes a media sensation, making him a celebrity. He goes on to sell his work, auctioning pieces off at lucrative prices.

It’s paining to any artist, or anyone who even appreciates art, that a person could use hype and copy popularized styles to make millions of dollars. It’s especially paining to Banksy, as it seems it is the main motive he made the film. I’ve personally seen this happen in every medium. Listen to the radio, watch a mainstream movie, I feel the pain too.

The main thing here is that Thierry is a genuinely flawed person. He’s not smart (I believe one person called him retarded). He’s not artistic. He’s just ambitious. With sheer ambition he is able to become famous, using accomplices better than himself.

He is shown to have ADD, not being able to focus, not even capable of creating a single art piece. Throughout the movie it is his hired assistants that do the work for him. In one of the extras, where he was to create one piece for a multi-artist exhibition, he asked for help, getting frustrated after trying for less than 30 seconds.

There are many lines spoken by Guetta, through his clumsy English, that strengthen the character. Simultaneously there are many lines said by Banksy, which question what art is. Sure, Guetta deliberately copied the people whom he videotaped, becoming an overnight celebrity with a piece as simple as a pop culture image with a mustache…but this shows how small the difference can be between art and a joke.

After watching the movie, I watched what I guessed are the two shorter extras [I’ll watch the other two tomorrow]. Then, I read the Wikipedia articles on the movie, Banksy, and Thierry Guetta. Before this, I didn’t know it was actually directed by Banksy! I then read that people and critics speculate the authenticity of the film. That the entire film was a hoax. Banksy created the character.

I recalled the movie in my head, questioning how plausible the main character was. I watch all serious films alone, taking it all in at once. I don’t think about plot holes, or question character’s motives, I just absorb it all feebly...but as I recalled the main character and the plausibility of the plot, it was quite ridiculous. A dimwitted nobody becomes an overnight celebrity?  Yet, the film was so good, that Thierry felt real.

The entire movie does fit into a hoax though. Banksy could’ve created this inferior artist, and the art behind it, and even display it in the public. The character’s name IS Mr. Brainwash… Still, I feel the character is too good to create. Maybe this guy, Thierry, is real. Then Banksy met him, took some of his old tapings of family events, and created the rest.

The film itself is great, and the thought that the entire thing may be a hoax makes it even greater. Banksy remains unidentified. The credited director is simply, “Banksy”. His elusiveness intrigues me, as does his art.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I just needed to write. Anyone can write a book. Maybe there’s some skills involved, like fitting wordplay and rhymes into a song's harmony…I just had to make sure I can write.

I don’t know what my next career is, or what I’m going to do when I get to San Francisco, but it probably involves writing. I could be writing scripts, making critiques, or documenting source code. It’s a skill that needs improving, and lasts forever.

A friend once started blogging. He said the reason he started was so he could write. He blogged for the sake of writing. It doesn’t matter who read it. He wrote his thoughts, observations, and published it on the internet.

Maybe my INTJ personality is good at writing. I can’t draw but I sure can place my thoughts onto paper, placing forth my judgement and personal observations.

Ugh, but non-fiction is boring. I hope I can write something cool, like an Alan Moore script!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Figured I should post something as I will be job hunting soon and my website is listed in my resume!

Like any techie, this domain is reserved for my personal use. Of course I wanted to design a cool website for myself but it just isn't a priority. Which leads to what's currently on my mind.

I had a thought about me trying to explain why there is such a small amount of creative companies that I'd want to work for. It started with an example and went from there.

Dreamworks is making Shrek X because upper management know it will make money no matter what the quality of the end result is. The original Shrek was a huge success, so marketing capitalized on it and turned it into a franchise. This limits the creativity of the team, probably forcing the auteur to quit because of it. Upper management probably makes rough deadlines--one Shrek movie per year. The company is now crap. Just like that.

Well okay, Kung Fu Panda 2 seemed to fare well with the critics. I haven't seen it.

Anyhow, this deterioration occurs to companies in every creative/entertainment industry. The music used in Shrek X are from popular artists because the public can recognize it, resulting in a more accessible product that is easier to market. Shrek X the video game is handed off to some game studio, restricting creativity, limiting quality due to a short deadline, resulting in more crap.

Only a handful of quality companies become large and successful companies--Pixar, Apple, Blizzard. So that leaves a few large companies and striving independent studios that favor quality over money.

I want to find a job within one of these companies, make a steady paycheck in a stress free work environment where I can cherish my work, 'cause working hard for something I'm not proud of is dissatisfying. After securing a job, I could then use my free time to work on other aspirations--music and film--to make something of my own. Possibly create my own company, or with friends. Personally invest in myself, or pray for an angel investor. Is this the only path in such a money-whoring world? Maybe I should just forget money completely. Become a traveling artist, a bum in most's eyes. Oh right, then I can't support a family. Hmm... Yup, that's the only path I can currently think of. The only path without selling my soul.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Overcoming the internal conflicts of an artist</title>
		<link>http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/overcoming-the-internal-conflicts-of-an-artist</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[These are the same universal conflicts conveyed in mainstream film cliches, advertisements, and other media.

The way people, or at least an artist, should think is simple: just do it. Nike's slogan reigns true.

But for me, I've had troubles. I've partially developed bad habits in an suburban environment in which I over research and get districted trying to figure out how, when even I know all I have to do is just begin. Begin a project.

Jonathan Blow approached these conflicts in a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqFutnYEANU">keynote speech</a>.

Jonathan Blow is the developer of the video game Braid. A game that I consider the Watchmen of video games, as it exposes the potential of a medium, as it expresses art at such high quality no other game can compare. Thanks to recent software developments, now, a team of two people can create an entire game, allowing independent developers to express themselves. Now, there also are multiple platforms  (Xbox Live, Steam, Facebook) for these games to reach a wide audience to. Now is the time for games to exceed, to become a medium that can compare to film or literature.

He began with a presentation about "How and Why".  He felt the reason people come to conferences is that people want to figure out how. "How do I become an indie developer", or "How do I get a publishing deal". This disregards the other half of the question: Why. "Why am I doing what I am doing?. What is my core motivation to do these things?"

His answer was simple and mirrors my recent thoughts. The answer is that you already are an independent game developer, you just have to start making things. The How part will solve itself as you are making things.

Although he is talking about independent games, these morals apply to any art medium. His answer reminded me of the ending of a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znIXyFh6dsI">poem</a> by Anis Mojghani in which he says, "Already am, already was, and I still have time to be".

Thinking back now on films, I can't think of many where this conflict is fought. I can only think of films where only the external conflicts are displayed. Hrmm, so maybe it isn't a film cliche.

So where does this leave me?

After watching a great film, I'm able to think about life on a higher level, putting everything into perspective. I then feel that the things I've been doing recently are insignificant, I need to clean up all my shit and just do it. The problem is I never get to doing it.

An associated major problem is the concern of money. My day job is programming. Most working environments for programming jobs aren't relaxing, or brooding creativity. They're marketing heavy, deadline driven, burn you out environments with a bad work/life balance. So, often, more time than I like is wasted in my day job.

Again, I come to question what choices do I have? Find my way into an amazing profitable independent video game company? Most are just a few friends that got together and made up a cool company name. The other choice is slowly becoming inevitable: One day I will have to give up my day job and put all of my time, effort, and money into my personal work.

I haven't gotten to that point yet. I haven't found a project that I feel great enough to. But I will do this: I will purge all of my insignificant crap that distracts me, so that I can focus on what's most important to me--my work.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/the_jack_of_all_trades.html">Play the game</a>.

This game is my submission for the Experimental Gameplay Project. The theme is <a href = http://experimentalgameplay.com/blog/2011/09/story-game-in-september-2011/>story game.</a>

It is the first game I've ever created. It took most of the 7 unemployed days to complete. I did not use a game engine, hence the prevalence of bugs. I learned and used ActionScript. Special thanks to the developers of <a href = http://www.flashdevelop.org/wikidocs/index.php?title=Main_Page>FlashDevelop</a>. Without it, I would have given up.

The game involves thoughts and experiences I've gone through recently. Mostly about finding yourself in a capitalist world. Although looking at the end product, the story seems like an overdone trope, something that belongs to the cheap clones theme. Still, I hope it resonates something within the player.

Hint: Look for your heart, not the golden trophy. (although I shouldn't have to give a hint, I feel my level design is bad)

EDIT: ...And the <a href="http://experimentalgameplay.com/blog/2011/09/story-game-roundup/">results</a> are in!]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Film Socialisme</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[During my post film internet browsing, I stumbled upon Roger Ebert's journal, which reminded me that I have a blog!

Review/mind dump time!

Today I saw Film Socialsime by Jean-Luc Godard at the lovely Pratt Institute (via Pratt Film Society). I have not seen Godard film before, and all I knew beforehand was that the film was broken into three parts and is likely unconventional.

It turned out to be completely unconventional. No narrative and no helping the audience consume any of the content being displayed.

I think it's better to just explain my personal experience.

During the first movement, I constantly tried to find the meaning of each scene and of the entire film, like any good film viewer. I was able to see artistically why some shots and scenes were taken. Yes, a cruise is for the bourgeoisie, which contrasts the histories of the ports of call. Maybe further insulting the upper class by showing how easily they are amused by kittens. Why spend money on a cruise if kittens would suffice? The grainy cell phone shot at the discotheque was pretty cool. Maybe there was even a statement against the high modern popular filmmaking production value, as it seems there was little care for that.

It felt as if an artsy amateur filmmaker went on a cruise, filmed as much as he/she could, picked out which scenes had some sort of artistic meaning, then combined them. Oh, and throw in a broken narrative that mentions large political problems (wars, AIDS) and condense it further into decrepit subtitles. I can imagine this playing at video_dumbo at the DUMBO arts festival (an event that showcases extremely experimental film) at midnight. And no one would care.

But this is Godard! And that is the only difference between this film and the other hundreds playing at arts festivals.

I stopped paying attention near the beginning of the second movement. I consider myself patient and appreciative, but this hit my limit. It's a film that cannot be consumed regularly. It's more of something to discuss, maybe interpret other's experience or reactions. Which is cool, but I still feel does not work. If I were a critic, I'd give it a 0. Maybe he should have written an essay instead of making a film.

While I was not paying attention to the film, I wondered about why the film failed (I still would not like to credit this film for making me think!). I think he was trying to push the medium into different ways, but it didn't work. Why didn't it work? Well, a film has to be somewhat cohesive to form...well something! You can't just throw nothing together and let the audience interpret what happened. Well, I think I have seen that in some other art form. Anyhow, I personally feel a film should have some cohesiveness (oh no! I'm stating what a film SHOULD have, that's limiting creativity man!). Or how about, a film should have a point. I guess this film's point was to be unconventional. Whatever.

I wonder if Jean-Luc Godard has a personality that seeks for something new every time. So he began with the now categorized "new-wave" films, which is a little unconventional, but still consumable by 5% of the population. Then, as he got older, he became less and less satisfied with current films, which urged him to be even more unconventional, more experimental. So unconventional that his latest film, Film Socialisme, was completely incoherent! Hah, seems like a sound theory to me!

Welp, I think that's enough. I hope this post was as incoherent as the film was!

Edit:

I had another thought about Film Socialisme and Blow's approach to game design on the way back from Pratt.

Although Film Socialisme makes a bad film, obviously not meant for entertainment, it's not bad as a standalone art. Instead of offering an experience through narrative, the experience is based on the audience's reaction.

Similarly, Blow's approach to game design and Rod Humble's The Marriage, doesn't tell the player what to do, it's up to the player to learn, think, and make their own experience.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>The Real Ninja</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/the_real_ninja.html">Play the game</a>.

This game is my submission for this month's Experimental Gameplay Project competition. The theme is <a href = http://experimentalgameplay.com/blog/2011/10/october-2011-is-slicing/>slicing.</a>

I stuck with ActionScript, but this time I used an engine, <a href="http://flashpunk.net/" title="FlashPunk">FlashPunk</a>! I must give credit to the amazing <a href = http://www.flashdevelop.org/wikidocs/index.php?title=Main_Page>FlashDevelop</a> again.

I've got to warn you that this is very unexperimental and goes against the values of the experimental gameplay project. I knew this going in when I chose the idea. I had a conflict. How does a new game developer develop expiremental game mechanics without having the experience of creating any games? I had more complex ideas, but I was afraid that I wouldn't be able to create it, afraid of losing motivation to overcome the hurdles during development. Instead I decided to choose a simple idea, so that I could create an entire game, polished, with my own art and sounds. To know what it takes to create a game. It's a stepping stone for my game development career. Polishing is essential to developing games too. What good is an expiremental game if you never create a final product out of it? It's just a prototype, an idea. My game doesn't belong on Experimental Gameplay Project, but EGP did inspire and motivate me to create a game. So I feel that it's a failure to EGP, but a personal success.

Welp, that's my excuse. Now that I feel more confident to take on more challenging prototypes, I swear my next project will be more experimental.

It's 11mb in size. Yep, it's a cheesy runner/fruit ninja hybrid.

EDIT: ...And the <a href="http://experimentalgameplay.com/blog/2011/10/slicing-roundup/">results</a> are in!

Postmortem:
I started out thinking about slicing idea and writing some out in my composition book. I had a few oh-so-cliche-for-indie puzzle platformers. One about folding, with three different mechanic ideas. I googled around to see if they were done already. <a href="http://www.nitrome.com/games/faultline/">Faultline</a> used one and in my opinion turned out to be a fantastic game. <a href="http://www.gamesetwatch.com/2010/01/foldable_platformer_paper_cake.php">Paper Cakes</a> used one, and was a student showcase at IGF 2010. The third one was about folding platforms. I also had two more mechanics that dealt with cutting an entire platform game into a rooms, then moving those around. I didn't find any game that has done either of them yet.

As I said, I'm a new developer and was afraid of being unable to output anything useful in the limited time, so I chose a runner fruit ninja style slicing game. I even had some neat ideas for that game: like using Box2d to actually cut through the enemies or cutting the stage to leave voids (which is required to solve some problem) or using gestures to cut in various ways.

None of this happened. I was only able to implement the fruit ninja slicing mechanic with normal collision. The rest of the time went into polishing, level design, art, sounds, voiceovers, etc. I learned that the core of a game (the main idea and core mechanics) is made within the first few days, the other 90% is polish. That's rough. Are all other arts this brutal? The core mechanics of Braid was made in two weeks and it took an additional three years to reach the final version. I think so.

The title of the post is the theme I chose at my first game jam, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=261046020606382">Castle Lab: Parsons x Babycastles</a>.

I've also written more about my about experiencing <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/my-first-game-jam">my first game jam</a>.

EDIT: To reduce frustration, I added controls to repeat the last command. Subsequently, the game's length has been reduced to five seconds!]]></content:encoded>

		<title>My Justification of Art in Video Games</title>
		<link>http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/my-justification-of-art-in-video-games</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I believe that if an enlightened person (someone able to distinguish art) were to look at past video games, he would not characterize the games as having artistic qualities. I want to disprove this.

Was all that time I played video games as a kid meaningless entertainment? I don't think it was. I want to pinpoint the art of video games, and without the heavy use of auxiliary arts (graphics, sounds, music), prove this theory with a prototype.

The main thing that comes to mind is the feeling of exploration. Exploration of an unknown environment with unknown rules.

In Earthbound, the player comes across saturns whom speak in a ridiculous language ($#@!). Does that mean saturns are good or bad? The player interacts with them to figure out they are good. 

Similarly, in Shadow of the Colossus, the player must interact with the colossi and the surrounding area to discover new elements which are required to solve the puzzles. 

It's this player interaction. It's the discovery of game rules. This is unique to video games.

exploration -> player interaction -> discovery/learning -> fulfillment (the good kind)

Hmm..well that's all I've got so far. I was going to draw a prototype, but I felt that the games that exist are enough to demonstrate this. <a href="http://windosill.com/">Windosill</a> is a the perfect example. This is enough to make me feel less bad for playing so many games when I was young. I just felt that it wasn't a complete waste of time, that there was something there, some new experience that interested me.

Maybe there's more than exploration and player interaction to it. I mean is that really enough to be art? Shouldn't there be some auteur's vision here? I dunno. I'll come back to this if I ponder more about it.

EDIT:
I guess I'm personally satisfied when I do something new (to me). Eating something I've never eaten before, watching a film that's nothing similar to any other film I've seen. The more original, the better. So when it comes to games, maybe that feeling of exploration is similar to experiencing something new.

That explains why I continued to play video games, but is this the art of video games? Ugh. I dunno. I'll come back to this if I ponder more about it.

EDIT2:
I just realized the past video games I refer to in this post refer to a small portion of all of the games I've played. Other reasons to play include competition and social entertainment (with friends). I'm ignoring those games in this post.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Poorly Designed Upgrades</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/poorly_designed_upgrades.html">Play the game</a>.

This game is my submission for this month's Experimental Gameplay Project competition. The theme is <a href="http://experimentalgameplay.com/blog/2011/11/upgrade-in-november-2011/">upgrade</a>.

I used ActionScript, <a href="http://www.flashdevelop.org/wikidocs/index.php?title=Main_Page">FlashDevelop</a>, and <a title="FlashPunk" href="http://flashpunk.net/">FlashPunk</a> again.

Last time I promised EGP and myself the game would be experimental. It's certainly more experimental than my previous games, but not quite enough. The ideas are there but I cheated myself and conveyed them on a shoot 'em up genre game. Never again!

Instructions

Goal:
Experiment with different upgrade setups to prevent enemies from reaching the bottom of the screen in various challenges.

Controls:
wasd or arrow keys to move
space bar to fire
f to autofire (on by default)

while in sandbox screen:
- and + to decrease or increase enemy HP (can hold the key down)
[ and ] to decrease or increase enemy spawn rate (can hold the key down)
u to enter the upgrade screen
1, 2, 3 to start a challenge

while in upgrade screen:
left click on the canvas to draw the current upgrade. This works similar to the pencil tool in a graphics editing program
*you can only draw on the ship or a neighboring pixel of the current upgrade
*you cannot overlap other upgrades
*protip, each <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_neighborhood">4-connected neighborhood</a> is treated as a separate gun
escape to go back to sandbox screen

while in challenge screen:
escape to go back to sandbox screen

<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcmpjIfb0OQ">Oooone mooore thing</a>. The boosters and challenges are actually poorly designed. Really, it's bad.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Dancing Zoo</title>
		<link>http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/dancing-zoo</link>
		<pubDate>Wed, 23 Nov 2011 17:45:42 +0000</pubDate>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I caught the North American premiere of Dancing Zoo which was screened for free by the <a href="http://www.koreanculture.org/?document_srl=21035">Korean Cultural Service of New York</a>.

The film is almost too similar <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Once_(film)">Once</a>. Much of the narrative is sung or told through soft spoken conversation. It's immediately known that the level of realism, maturity, and quality is not at on par with Once, but it still has all the charm.

In Dancing Zoo, two very young musicians fall in love, discover the impossibility of working (and assumed living) with each other, but are thankful for the experience.

The film does appear to be cheesy at times, but I felt some of it was natural as the leads were two young Koreans. I'd guess around college age but I could be wrong as Koreans do appear young. Their age and their actions caused a little conflict in my believability. Two college age Asians wondering about, playing music, living in their own apartments, living the artist way of life. Hmm, maybe they were older than I thought.

I also felt the film was somewhat natural because it depicted some characteristics that Koreans have. In the perspective of an American, the film can appear as an inauthentic, cutesy, dreamy, romantic story. Although that's somewhat true, I felt that a real Korean relationship may certainly be just as cutesy, dreamy, and romantic. The characters' gestures of greetings and farewells are sweet and shy. The notion of having sex after a date does not exist; Perhaps that's an American notion emblazoned by Hollywood. The characters' use little dialogue in communication. Well, that's not specifically an Asian trait, that's universal, but it felt right.

So although the film is flawed, having bad screenplay at times, disjointed at other times, and unbelievably cutesy (everyone laughed at the early romantic montage), it still retains some authenticity in the way a real, young Korean relationship could be, as I don't know for certain and can't compare. It even retains an atmosphere of realism throughout the film's narrative. The characters make emotional and rational decisions, falling victim to love, learning from experience, and maturing from it.

Somehow all of this is conveyed in a film which is in song seventy percent of the time. The music never hindered my viewing. It consisted of the expected simple acoustic songwriting music and sometimes indie electronic music. I actually remember disliking Once at many parts because the same old guitar chords repeated for every song. This didn't happen here. The music never became annoying. It fit, complementing the slow paced dreamy film.

For me the pros outweighed the cons during my viewing and I was able to dream along with the characters in the movie, forgetting it's flaws. I wondered if Koreans are characteristically quiet and well-natured. I wondered if romance is worth the time. Slow paced films allow me to wonder. I'm glad to have experienced such a unique, independent film coming from Korea. The only Korean films I've seen were by already acclaimed directors Park Chan-wook and Bong Joon-ho. I can only hope for a new wave of this kind from all parts of Asia. Or perhaps great little films exist worldwide and I just lucked out by catching the premiere of this one at a tiny theater in Chinatown.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>The Choice between Career and Exploration</title>
		<link>http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/the-choice-between-career-and-exploration</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[[Old thought, just posting without proofreading.]

10/19
A recurring thought. Media is distracting. So much time is wasted experiencing media. Facebook, TV shows, the Internet. It's much wiser to allocate that time into creating things.

Life is a balancing game. You have to balance work (for profit), art, family, friends, and free time.

More narrowly, you also have to balance daily life. I feel I am closer to my body than others are. I follow what my body signals me. During the day, I'm more creative; At night, I can get hard work done. I eat when my body tells me to, not becuase it's time to eat. I excercise when my body tells me to, often at night or especially after working in an office for 8 hours. I take breaks, strech, to step back and think about problems at a higher level. I eat protien for lunch to avoid a high blood sugar spike. I eat fruit and nuts at night because I feel like having something juicy, not grains or protien. I move around throughout the day, rarely sitting in the same position for a prolonged period of time. I use a yoga ball as a chair. I try to have a comfortable ninety degree angle for my legs and use a keyboard tray. I move my neck around a lot because after looking at a computer, it just doesn't feel right. That's the word: feeling. I go by feeling. My gut reaction.

I feel that this lifestyle is more healthy than one who bases their actions on time. A person who lives based on time may do some of the following. Eat at the same times, even though they woke up late. Excercise at set times, even though their body doesn't benefit from it. Work at a set time, such as working in the morning even if they're a late afternoon person. These people also aren't active throughout the day. If their activity were a graph, it would be a roller coaster. Eating a large lunch (high blood sugar), napping right after (low), working at a sedentary office job (low), heavy excercise / weightlifting (high), overeating again (low), etc. I'd associate this to the blood sugar / glucogen problem. Furthermore, when people have high blood sugar, they crash, being unable to focus. End up wasting hours on Facebook, or making their job feel even longer. This also makes them more suspectible to falling into a stupor and watching mass media. Or, they temporarily fix this by taking a drug: caffiene, 5 hour energy, ridilin, etc. 

Hm. So maybe carbs are to blame? Carbs, excercise, and motivation.

BLOG THE ABOVE!

11/23
After Ivar left for Thanksgiving break, my mind has went on a thinking tangent. Having someone nearby keeps me focused on work. Now that he's gone, I've just been thinking. On life, my future, family, friends.

I've said before, at my core I'm a vagabond. I like to explore, live, create. This can be seen as greedy as it takes away from family time. I just have to make sure I commnicate with my family and friends while I'm gone. Start using skype weekly. Go to India with my parents next time.

I would be okay with living in poverty as long as I'm doing the things I like. I'll only comprimise to a desk job if I need the money or social interaction.

It's no different then when I was young. Before, I used to explore neighborhoods on my bike. I still explore neighborhoods on my bike! But now I can go further, around the world. I also now have the confidence to make things. I have a much clearer mind. I'm healthy.

I really need to work on an art, with integrity, using everything I've got. No small projects, only ambitous ones.

How do I balance, exploration, art, and family? I want to live all over of the world, yet make a great artpeice which requires a lot of time, and somehow be at home periodically. What to choose?

I said before, at this age, I need to create. But is exploring also limited to this age? Is 30s+ all family time?

Go for it. Explore and try to create simultaneously. Go for that crazy exploration trip around the world.

Explore -> Discover -> Experience -> Inspire -> Create, repeat, and communicate with family throughout

Only the final product matters, not how you get there.

Hm. Should I contruct a side business that's somewhat profitable? Only if I am truly interested in it! That would still be considered being influenced by money. But still, that may be better than relying on contracts/part time jobs, 'cause that's working for somebody else.
You can't have both due to the immigration limitations [link] that restrict you from staying over 90 days.
I could easily move to another english speaking country (New Zealand, Austrailia). I could even teach English in an Asian country (Jet Programme wiki), but I don't want to work for a job I'm not interested in. I've already concluded that's a waste of time. [link to nofilmschool]. I need to work on my interests. Film, video games, this blog, etc. So it seems moving to another country without an indendent career or a job I'm interested lined up is a waste.
I've almost decided to go back to San Francisco. Continue being myself, doing as I wish.
The next time my parents go to India, I can go with them and time an East Asia trip before that. When I do go to India, I'd also like to learn my native language (Gujarati), spoken and written. Travel around India for a while.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[After watching a great film I am inspired. It just happened again with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/35_Shots_of_Rum">35 Shots of Rum</a>.

After experiencing a great film I reflect upon my life, my past present and future.

It reminds me of what's important in life, placing everything into perspective. I immediately begin to remove anything invaluable nearby (close browser tabs, clean my desk, clear my schedule) so that I can focus on what's most important. It keeps me on track.

Sometimes it pulls me away from my lucky American life, and makes me think about how wastefully I've spent my time and money. It holds me close to the ideal <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_living">simple life</a>. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_Push_Cart">Man Push Cart</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtles_can_fly">Turtles Can Fly</a>].

Sometimes it reminds me that I am not the only one and that I am normal. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apu_trilogy">The Apu Trilogy</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tree_of_Life_(film)">Tree of Life</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish_Tank_(film)">Fish Tank</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Still_Walking_(2008_film)">Still Walking</a>].

Other times I just ponder. It's sadly one of the few times in my life I am not busy, away from the distractions of the modern world. An ample portion of my thoughts text file was written after watching a film. I owe films for providing me these crucial moments. I've made many life altering decisions during them.

Of course it's not limited to films. It could be a <a href="http://www.ted.com/">TED talk</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znIXyFh6dsI">a Youtube video</a>, a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchmen">comic book</a>, a crucial life event, anything. But it's so convenient to watch a film in two hours on my laptop knowing that there's a great chance of it affecting me. It's a tough decision to risk my time on anything else when I know I can be satisfied with a film.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Replacing a Hard Disk Drive with Mac OS X and Boot Camp</title>
		<link>http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/replacing-a-hard-disk-drive-with-mac-os-x-and-boot-camp</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I wanted to install Unity to create a 3D game I thought of for EGP but I can't because I don't have enough space on my Boot Camp partition! The feeling of being blocked from the things you want to do is awful.

I have MacBook Pro (13" early 2011, Model Number: A1278) with 196GB allocated to the Mac OS X 10.7 (Lion) partition and 42GB allocated to the Windows 7 partition. Bad idea, as I've found I use Windows 95% of the time now. After a searching a little on Google it seems there is no recommended (reliable and popular) way to re-size the partition, instead I must re-install the Boot Camp partition.

While researching I thought this would be a good time to finally upgrade to a solid-state drive and do everything at once.

After little research I've decided to choose the Samsung 830 over the Crucial m4 and Intel 510 (all 256GB versions) based on the few MacRumors threads I read. I calculated my Windows install (applications, but no media) takes the full 37.9GB with 4GB virtual memory, and my Mac OS X install takes around 80GB (or was it 60?*). I don't want to run into this problem of low space again, so I decided on the larger 256GB drives. From what I gather the Samsung 830 controller is newer/better, compatible with Mac OS X, and can update the firmware from within Boot Camp. Normally I'd choose Intel so I don't have to worry about reliability, but I did not see any price or performance competitive options from Intel. Besides, I loves me some Samsung.

Upon reading the current <a href="http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/ssd-review-benchmark,3115.html">Best SSDs For The Money article by Tom's Hardware</a> I stumbled upon a <a href="http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/ssd-laptop-upgrade-optical-bay,3102.html">neat solution</a> which allows you to install a second hard disk drive in the optical bay. MacRumor users found a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Drive-Unibody-MacBook-SuperDrive-Replacement/dp/B0058AH2US">cheap alternative form Amazon</a>. I'm thinking about ordering one and placing my hard disk drive in there.

Just thinking ahead of a good video editing system, I could store the original footage on the hard disk (HFS+) and edit on the SSD. My current external hard drive uses NTFS and I use a NTFS driver (NTFS-3G or Paragon, I don't remember) to read it from Mac OS X. I remembered reading something about the exFAT file system. That sounded like the perfect file system for external drives, but after a little research it wasn't. I'll have to do some more reading.

I'll update this post early next month with my results. It might even be separated into two posts, resizing and buying a SSD.

UPDATE:
Success. I was able to clone my Mac and Windows installations. For the most part I followed <a href="http://johnbeales.com/20110330/transferring-osx-bootcamp-to-new-hard-drive/">this well-written guide</a>. It was an overall smooth process.

Here's a tiny list of hurdles I went through:

Before I began I uninstalled NTFS for Mac driver. I'm not sure if this was necessary.

<blockquote>2. Follow the wizard to create a BootCamp partition. This partition does not need to be the same size as your old Boot Camp partition. When Boot Camp Assistant asks you to insert a Windows install disk quit Boot Camp Assistant. Your partition is created.</blockquote>
During this step, when I clicked install in WinClone, it would ask for a Windows disk without creating a partition. I had to insert my Windows 7 disk for it to partition. After that, my PC restarted and booted from the Windows CD. From here I selected the Boot Camp partition and selected format (after clicking advanced options). I don't think this did anything though. I then quit the setup, restarted the PC, held options to boot into Mac, and continued to recover the image from WinClone.
<blockquote>8. Turn on your Mac holding down the Option key on the keyboard. You should see your Boot Camp partition as a boot option, (it’s probably labeled “Windows”). Select it to boot into Windows.</blockquote>
The first time I tried to boot into Windows the PC displayed a blank black screen with a Windows mouse cursor. I had to hard power off. The next boot worked perfectly.

After I was done I was able to use Samsung Magician software to update the solid-state drive's firmware within Boot Camp. I used the Windows update option, as opposed to creating a bootable CD or USB.

I also checked to see if disk defragmenter was turned off in Windows as it is not needed for solid-state drives.

Finally, Mac OS X feels as nimble as Window 7. As I had guessed, the hard drive was the bottleneck. The good old Core 2 Duo lives another day. Also, it's nice not to have to move files around to compensate for the lack of space. So worth the time.

		<title>Buying a Professional Video Camera</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[is a nightmare.

There's far too many choices. Do I get a consumer camcorder, a prosumer camcorder, a DSLR with video capabilities, or a real professional film camera?  Well, the consumer camcorders have the consumer look, prosumer camcorders produce the same quality but have more buttons, DSLRs are missing features to consider it as a video camera, and a real film camera costs $7000.

A "pro" would say. Buy a real film camera. If you don't have the money but know that film is what you want to do in life, save up for a real film camera.

A smart person will tell you to film with whatever you have. If the camera is limiting your abilities, buy whatever is within your budget.

If I could turn back time I'd buy a $600 TM-900 and start shooting; Then buy things as I need them.

That didn't happen. I over-researched, spending more time reading when I could have been shooting. I ended up with a $1150 Panasonic DMC-GH2 with the 14-140mm lens. Although I don't regret my purchase I do regret the time wasted.

Hm, now I'm unsure if I should provide the research I did as it may enable a reader to continue researching.

Might be updated soon!

Update!:
11/28/2014
Even though that Panasonic was the gem of DSLR / mirror-less film-making, it sucked as a film camera. The stabilization made it impossible for any sort of recording while walking. The camera itself was large. The camera would eat up battery and memory cards.

I sold it and bought a Panasonic v750. USB-powered and steadicam-like stabilization. If only I had bought the camcorder two years ago.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Fixing Err-3 on a 1998 Acura Integra Car Stereo</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It's wonderful what you can do with Google.

My sister told me her car stereo wasn't working. I checked it and found that it displayed Err-3. After a little Googling I discovered this is part of the anti-theft system and must have triggered after the battery had recently died.

Here are the steps to reset the anti-theft system:
<ol>
	<li>Check if your car has a sticker with a code written on it. Here's a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgfRmBo7Pu0">video</a> that shows possible locations. If you find the code, skip to step 5.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.team-integra.net/forum/blogs/morningz/43-g3-radio-removal.html">Pull out the stereo</a> to obtain the device serial number and keep it pulled out.</li>
	<li>Write down the serial number so that you don't have to remove the stereo again</li>
	<li>Get the code by supplying the serial number, VIN, and other information. Try this <a href="https://radio-navicode.acura.com/">website</a>. If that doesn't work, call a dealership, ask for parts and services, and tell them you need the code. If they don't give the code or try to charge you, try another dealership.</li>
	<li>If you came from step 1, disconnect the car battery, wait 30 seconds, and reconnect. If not, disconnect the power cable from the car stereo, wait 30 seconds, and reconnect.</li>
	<li>Enter the code</li>
	<li>Celebrate</li>
</ol>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This is my half-assed entry for <a href="http://experimentalgameplay.com/blog/2012/03/economy-in-march-2012/">Experimental Gameplay Project March 2012</a>. The theme is Economy. It's an analog game! I'll make a digital game soon...

Rules:
<ol>
	<li>Each player (vendor) is given a set of n blank cards. N being the number of players or 5 at a minimum.</li>
	<li>Each player draws a single item and duplicates it on all of their cards. Example items: A spaceship, Obama, a Macbook Pro, Excalibur, an empty tin can.</li>
	<li>Each player writes the value of their item on the card. Example values: 1, 1 million, 1/3, 1283, $1.99, pie.</li>
	<li>Each player keeps 5 cards in hand and discards the rest. (This is done so that players can evenly distribute their cards when they get eliminated)</li>
	<li>The player with the highest valued item begins the first turn (barter).</li>
	<li>Turn: The current player must barter with another player. The number of cards exchanged must be equal on both sides. Example barter: "I'll trade 1 spaceship, 2 Obamas, and a Macbook Pro for 3 empty tin cans!". The players exchange cards. The other player must now respond with the new total value of his goods within a time limit [5 seconds]. If the other player succeeds, the game continues. If the other player fails, the player is eliminated and must evenly distribute their cards among the remaining players.</li>
	<li>If a round completes, the time limit decreases by [1 second]. The time limit resets to the default value once a player is eliminated.</li>
	<li>The game continues until 2 players are left. In order for the final player to win, one player must fail a barter and the other player must succeed during the next barter.</li>
</ol>

Optional Rules:
Players must role-play as a vendor. Example vendors: the merchant from Resident Evil 4, Crazy Dave from Plants vs Zombies, an ambiguous Middle Eastern vendor.

WARNING:
This game has not been play-tested.

Copyright issues:
The title may have been inspired by Ridiculous Fishing.

How this came about:
I actually wanted to make a game in Unity but my windows partition had insufficient space, so I started thinking about analog games and new media. The main idea was written during public transport. I worked it out a little more on a composition book. That's it.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Somewhat experimental</strong>
Games based off of an input device:
iPad:
- Controlling an amoeba, heavy use of physics? Imagine flinging part of the amoeba outward to try to move it. Would have to play with it.

- The game of horse. One player creates the gesture, the second player must match it.

- When a player touches, a line connects each touch, allowing the player to create shapes. A simple game would be to let a variety of shaped objects fly by, and the goal would be for the player to try to accurately encapsulate the shape. Imagine a shape that has 10 vertices!

- A Mario Party / WarioWare like game. A bunch of mini games in which players compete or cooperate. Example game: drag the [single] coin to your corner. This may cause physical roughness. I haven't played BUTTON, but it seems like I'm thinking of old ideas. =/

Games based off of feelings:
- A romantic game. I mean Wong Kar-Wai shit. Atmospheric. Poetic. Now with interactivity!
- A game that captures city loneliness. Hmm...

Games based off of a new game mechanic:
- A game in which you can move portions of an entire level, a room. When rooms are connected, the objects inside them can traverse through each room. Eh, difficult to explain in writing...

- 3D folding. See Fault Line by Nitrome for 2D version. Further thinking and exploration required.

- A two player game in which the players' screens contradict each other (think Between by Jason Rohrer). The game could start out with the players' screens matching (to condition the players what's normal), then introduce differences. For example, the one player could be helping the other by feeding him cake, but on the other player's screen it is shown as poison, and is only noticed through interaction.

- A game in which players play one at a time in order to create a story. Can even use an existing story making game. Hmmmm, I remember playing this on paper before...

- A slightly different idea. A game in which players play one at a time in order. The current player can see all of the past players actions. Each player goes through an avatar creation screen to create an avatar. The current player's avatar interacts with a main character at some point in time, a memory. The choices the players make influence the main characters path. Will the players cause the main character to defeat the enemy, wonder aimlessly, or cause suicide? Players should be able to see past play-throughs of the game.

- A 2D game with multiple layers. The player must traverse the layers, complete actions within them, which combined, solves the puzzle.

- A game which uses microphone input to move a character around, which also emits sound waves. Think Metal Gear Solid. The player quietly says "up", and the character moves up whilst emitting a small sound wave. A guard gets closer, the player panics and says "up" with a louder volume, the character moves up and emits an even larger sound wave. The sound wave mechanics can be explored. There could be items within the game that affect the sound waves in different ways: block it entirely, reduce the size, increase the size, rebound, invert. Could even make the game 3D. Devil Tuning Fork? So Pretty. Based off of an <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/can-you-imagine-yourself-as-a-verbal-assassin">old prototype</a>. Note to self: MAKE THIS HAPPEN. 2D, likely.

<strong>Non-experimental</strong>
Games that would be fun to make and play (party games?):
- A multiplayer game that requires the teamwork of 4 players. Each player has a certain occupation or skill.
- A one versus all multiplayer game. Any genre. For example, if it were a platformer, have 3 lakitus and one player

Games that are minutely different so that I can finish a game without killing myself:
- An auto-runner game, but in which you have to manipulate the obstacles

Games that could do well with a minimalist approach:
- The Settlers like game. Or make on that works.
- A real-time strategy game. A simplified Company of Heroes. Arena matches. 3 vs 3 units, 5 vs 5 units.

Games that express a statement:
- Occupy Wall Street - A game that simulate OWS. Top down, think Risk (board game), for each area of New York. The player can allocate protesters to each area. There would have been statistics for number of protesters, peacefulness, arrests, deaths, impact on the economy, etc. The main point was to show the player that peaceful protests do not work, only violence brings the attention of the public to make any useful change. Yeah, lame.

- Corporate Workplace - Eh, I had an idea, but this is overdone.

- Impact of Human Resource Consumption - Might make this for EGP 3/12. Mechanics should be similar to a Settlers game, or a god game, so it'll be interesting enough to program.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Here's the story behind <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/can-you-imagine-yourself-as-a-verbal-assassin">Can You Imagine Yourself as a Verbal Assassin?</a>.

Well, not the whole story. I've divided the story into two parts as I was involved with two games, one with a team and one personal. The first story is about the development of my personal game. The second story is about my experience at the game jam and the development of the team game. I'll start at the time the theme was given.

Jammers (I'm making this term up) were able to choose any posts by the <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/Horse_ebooks">Horse ebooks twitter account</a>. No one knows the origin or reason for the account. It appears to be run by a program which grabs phrases from the internet and posts it every few hours. The results are interesting, as some phrases seem poetic.

Initially I was felt bummed out for having such a broad theme, but then some of the more thoughtful posts stuck out to me. "Will there be cars without drivers?". I thought about some futuristic place where suddenly the protagonist realized there are cars without drivers. Where are they all going? What is their purpose? The second one that stuck out was "Can you imagine yourself as a verbal assassin?". So I imagined. How can you be a verbal assassin? What dose that even mean? How do you kill with words? Is the theme implying that a verbal assassin is lesser than a normal assassin? Then somehow I got the idea that the assassin talks out loud, "move up, move up, move up, stab". That's going to 'cause problems with an assassination. People will hear the assassin. Then the vision of a Metal Gear type game came up, in which sound waves are displayed every time the character talks, and you must be careful so that the enemies cannot hear you. Most of these thoughts occurred within the first hour. It was the most exciting part. There was so much creativity brooding.

I didn't spend very long on the game. Maybe 5 hours one day and 4 hours the next day. I got the core mechanics down the first day and threw in a story and level design the next day. Because I didn't spend much time on it, I wanted it to just show the mechanic, the idea, in the comedic way. No polish. I could have added Metal Gear sounds, or even a parody of it. I'm sure if I polished it it would have been more fun for the jammers to play. But I guess after making my last game, I don't care for polish. I only care for experimenting and art.

The game didn't fly so well with the players. I should have reduced "move up" to "up", as players got frustrated typing, or were just unable to touch type (that was painful to watch). "Move up" was in there because I had I planned to add other mechanics such as "say move up"/"whisper move up"/"yell something"/"stab up"/etc. I actually had a more difficult second level, but I correctly guessed that it would have frustrated the player so bad that they would never get to the ending.  Ah well. Again, my game wasn't meant to be popular or polished, it was meant to be experimental.

It was fun to see different personalities play. Some without patience. Some expecting more polish. Very few able to figure out they could move in any direction. I guess a simple fun platformer like MeatBoy is what they desired. Too bad this was not the game.

I guess that's my personal gripe against game jams. It seems the most polished game (fully equipped with assets) would win. Even in Ludum Dare, this happens. I would personally strive for the most innovative badge, not the best game overall. Who cares for a non-creative polished 5 minute game?

Of course I didn't win anything. Actually, I was surprised that the game I voted for won first from the judges. That game actually was unique, fit a craaazy theme, and was polished. Congrats to that guy. The other winners were simple polished games.

I still love the idea of my game and may go further with it. Using a microphone, the player could say "up" and the sound wave and character movement would depend on the player's volume. A teammate mentioned maybe the sound waves could bounce off of the certain walls. That'd be awesome too. I'm reminded of <a href="http://www.devilstuningfork.com/">Devil's Tuning Fork</a>. I think waves itself can be explored a lot more.

The Team Story.

Rewind back to the beginning, when the theme was given. All of the jammers started looking at the feeds on their Macbooks and Iphones, throwing out ideas. Teams were not chosen by an administrator. Jammers were just told to form teams within the first few hours, naturally. Veteran jammers, and anyone who came with a friend were already had a team. The stragglers just awkwardly gravitated toward another and it eventually worked out. There were a bunch of programmers, some musicians/sound folks, some illustrators, and everyone was essentially a game designer.

The team I got along with was awesome. Really great people with good taste and values, which was discussed at some random bar that served meatballs and potatoes, and later at Barcade. The discussion of art in games was really interesting. It's nice to know that everyone agrees that Braid is a powerful statement, that Machinarium is cool, and that Gears of War is a teenage kid's fantasy.

Moving along, the team consisted of me, an iOS programmer, a Processing programmer/sound engineer, and a game designer/artist/musician/asset master. Three programmers whom all used different languages. Perfect.

One of the ideas that the game designer pitched was about the horse tweet "Advantage". The player needs an advantage over other players to win. A multiplayer game in which everyone is against a common enemy, yet compete against each other. It's simultaneously cooperative and competitive. That was the main idea/mechanic. It could be applied to any kind of game. The first game that came to both of our minds was space invaders. It works, it's fun, it's easy to implement. So, he later pitches the idea to the other two, then we go to the drawing board, and bam, a game.

To win, one player must have x points more than the player with the second most points. Everyone loses when the enemies destroy the base.

We wanted the game to be four players, so the iOS developer was silently chosen as the main programmer. The other programmer planned to learn Objective-C/cocoas2d/box2d and help. The game designer/asset master created design documentation, raster graphic art, AND music (It was amazing how he just made Egyptian melodies. It even had basslines!). I sorta left the group, as I didn't feel I'd be helpful programming in a framework I'm unfamiliar with within 48 hours.

From what I gathered, the iOS developer (who's just started programming recently) had troubles using Box2d and wished he hadn't used it at all as it was the cause of most of the problems. Without it, I'm sure he could have made the game. So in the end, the game was incomplete. I believe it would have won if it was complete. I think the team is going to finish it anyway. I'll even look at it myself, to try iOS developemnt.

So the moral of the story is: If you plan to create a full game, use the framework you are most familiar with. Learning a new one (or one you are inexperienced with) within 48 hours is tough. Oh, and if you plan to win, make it simple, polished, and minutely creative.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>What makes a game meaningful and how innovative mechanics aren&#039;t enough</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[During the production of my first few game prototypes [September-November 2011], I was inspired to create games with new game mechanics. But now as I am creating this month's EGP game, novel game mechanics are not enough for me. It's not enough to motivate me to continue creating.

I am now gearing towards Jenova Chen's philosophy. Making a game that causes the player to feel a certain way.

Thinking about film for a second, as <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/inspired-by-films-and-everything-else">films have greatly influenced me</a>, I cannot think of an experimental film that greatly affected me. The films that the were meaningful to me, that influenced me, were ones that made me feel differently. [Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind did come to mind]

I can't name many games that directly express a feeling. Most current great games have a novel game mechanic and fit the secondary art (story, graphics, music) around it [in good taste] to express the feeling: Ico (care), Shadow of the Collosus (epicness), Braid (enigmatic). Few games have a more direct approach: Dys4ia (frustration) [IMO, amazing], ...But That Was [Yesterday] (sadness) and Between (lots!). Okay it seems now I'm just naming some of my favorite games. But perhaps that's the reason they are my favorite. They were meaningful because they made me feel a certain way. They moved me.

Isn't that the core of art, an expression of feeling?

What place do purely mechanical games such as (glancing at IGF) Spelunky, Antichamber, Beat Sneak Bandit, The Floor is Jelly, even the mechanically genius Storyteller have? In order for it to be meaningful to me, will these games have be fully developed, realized, harness an emotion for it to have a pronounced affect on me? [Botanicula did make me smile]

I think so. I don't even care about most of those game as of now.

If Braid did not have the story, graphics, level design, and music that it did, would it have been great? I don't think so. It would have just been another puzzle game with cool new mechanics. A forgotten IGF winner for best design. A squander.

The importance of "finishing your game" is reiterated. And by finish, it is implied to develop the game until every aspect is fully thought out, until you've spent years of your life creating something, something that somehow your life now depends on, in hope that it will be equally appreciated by others as it is to you.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>La Planète Sauvage (Fantastic Planet)</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[[Old draft, just posting without proofreading.]

Fantastic Planet thoughts while watching:
First, thought about how great it is as a animal rights movie. Placing humans has pets.

Then I thought about how Jonathan Blow mentioned that he liked to read Calvino because it expands his mind. I agree. The book is fantastic for thinking, creating new ideas, as is this film.

Then I started thinking about how primitive ideas are the core of real world problems. Tribes translate to countries. Who cares about airport security or offices. None of that matters.

Then I thought more about how humans can be compared to insects. They multiply, live in undesirable places

Making something universal as this helps it become timeless.

The film reaks of creativity. Other sci-fi films often have only a few alterations compared to real life. This one never stops. If you were to watch a random clip of the film before seeing the entire film, you wouldn't be able to comprehend what is going on. You would think the film is strictly for hippies. Once put together, it's completely coherent. [Trying to think of others, only Miyazaki comes to mind]

interview with the director:
Favors ideas over polish.
He was interested in shadow puppets, and created a film of it with mentally ill patients. That lead to finding an artistic partner, worked on it for 4 years in another country while war was going on, outsourcing work.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://rahilpatel.com/rgbrgbrgb.html">Play the game</a>.

This is my entry <a href="http://experimentalgameplay.com/blog/2012/03/economy-in-march-2012/">Experimental Gameplay March 2012</a>. The theme is economy. It is the result of developing a game without thinking about the core game mechanic first. It is a complete failure.

Controls:
Player 1/Player 2 - description

A/' - Red
S/; - Green
D/L - Blue
F/K - hold and press RGB to direct military to retreat, halt, and attack
G/J - hold and press RGB to tell workers to get a specific resource (by default it auto-gathers)

Finger mapping:
Player 1, use right hand
Player 2, use left hand

Player 2's controls mirrors Player 1

A/' - index finger
S/; - middle finger
D/L - ring finger
F/K - little finger
G/J - little finger

How to play:
It's just a simple real-time strategy game, except you play with a keyboard. Blue units gather resources, green do nothing as of now [supposed to research/upgrade], red can attack.

Other Notes:
As of now battles are sad due to lack of solid objects and pathfinding. Also, there is no win condition.

Post thoughts:

What was envisioned:
1000s of units, flocking, simple yet competitive gameplay (think Hokra), precise controls (think QWOP), color-collar workers (and a statement against classism), resource renewal (and a statement against resource consumption), map based off of image, able to upload map (MS paint is now a map editor!), large resolution to zoom in and out.

Why it didn't work:
Decreasing the amount of player input increases the amount of AI programming. Competitive games require more balancing and tuning than non-competitive games. Multiplayer on the the same screen isn't as fun because it lacks fog of war.

Also, I felt like crap while making this. It was forced. It just didn't feel right.

Future:
I feel like a game could be created with these initial ideas, but I can't bare to look at it again.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Designing Educational Games: The Indie Way</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I attended the VINCI / Sid the Science Kid hackathon. It turned out to be a startup pitch event for developing an educational game using a VINCI tablet.

After I poorly <a href="#pitches">pitched my game</a>, I had a burning thought, the reason I had to write this post: I felt that the design behind technology in education is poor because of the designer's approach and money.

I imagine when a typical educational game designer thinks of a game, they constrain the game to the limits of what they perceive a kid can do. Thus resulting in worthless passive games (think film with buttons).

I believe that if I was a kid and given any educational game from today, I would have played the game for 5 minutes and trashed it. I would have deemed that the game lacked value. Yep, even as a kid I had values.

Educational game designers could take few points from the current independent game scene. Indie game designers strive to let the player learn to play the game by playing the game, without a tutorial. Indie game designers also try to make a game as accessible as possible, so even a person who hasn't been conditioned to a similar game can play.

I think one approach to this is to take a complex system and try to simplify the interface as much as possible, without losing the core functions. My game is essentially a simplified music composition application. What else can be simplified? How about other creative endeavors: writing a book, making a film, choreographing a dance, designing a house, designing a game. How about occupations: forensic scientist, nurse, documentarian, journalist, photographer.

The other problem is sadly money. If money already greatly influences the American education system, then it surely affects technology in education. The existence of a poorly marketed two-day $80,000 prize startup pitch event perfectly demonstrates the influence.

The end result: an indie game developer rants and another terrible educational game is funded.

<a name="pitches"></a>
<h3>The Pitches</h3>
I pitched two ideas, one with a team and one without.

The team pitch development started with many great ideas but became something monstrous and out of scope. Still, I don't regret teaming up. I feel that having a team enforces the result product to be more accessible. My personal pitch is clearly a product of my personality, and likely only works for my kind.

My personal pitch was for a game in which the player draws to create music. The x-axis is time and y-axis is pitch. The game has pre-defined sounds it can recognize and indicates the player once found. For example, if the player draws a stick figure, the game recognizes and indicates the vertical line used for the body as a clap sound. The clap sound is now marked as discovered under a list of sounds. Perhaps there's a sound below that for applause (with a play button beside it to play it). Now, since the player knows how to create a clapping sound, he may intuitively draw multiple vertical lines to create an applause sound. In the process, the player will learn how the game works and go on to try to mimic the other sounds listed.

The possible features are exactly those of any professional music making program. Colors (different instruments), sound recording, save composition function, etc. I imagine the core sounds would progress: make a crescendo, a decrescendo, a siren sound (wave), jingle bells (without pitch), jingle bells (with pitch).

I doubt my game will be chosen. It requires too much development time; It's not feasible. The judges likely feel it's too complex for a 5 year old. Yet, of all of the pitches, the only game I'd actually want to develop is my own.

UPDATE:
The team I was on won, but the misrepresentation of the prizes and the misorganization of the development process steered me away.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Universalism in Art</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I recently saw an elderly person perform stand-up comedy and it triggered the thought of universalism in art.

Humor from elderly people is almost always universal from my experience. Everyone probably has a humorous uncle that's able to make the whole family laugh.

I personally wouldn't ever want to create something targeted to a specific audience. For example, I wouldn't want to create an movie based on a manga, which is likely targeted at the Japanese and Otaku population. I'd want to create a Miyazaki film. I don't even think of anime when Miyazaki comes to mind. Yet, Miyazaki's films possess many common characteristics of anime. Why? Because his work is universal; It's able to reach to everyone.

This thought reminds me of when Jenova Chen mentioned wanting to create an experience that is as universal as Miyazaki.

Another example of universalism in art is Pokemon. Pokemon do not conform to any culture. They are creatures, quite different from real animals, having somewhat unique names (maybe they mean something in Japanese?). My mom doesn't know anything about the show but when she hears "pikachu" in Ash's pikachu's voice, she associates it with the pokemon in her mind. That's powerful. I believe the reason Pokemon was a success is because it is universal.

The same goes for many Disney films, and other things often revered by the public -- The Godfather, Shawshank Redemption, Michael Jackson, The Beatles, Marvin Gaye, etc.

Universalism is achieved by avoiding references, cliches, and things that would limit the audience.

<strong>A digression</strong>
Hmm. Perhaps a method to create something universal is to figure out how to introduce something innovative to the broadest audience. Finding something specific in the world that you think is beautiful, and trying to show it to the world by making it more accessible.

Yeah. That sounds like the virtue of commercial art. Fine art doesn't care for everyone else. It's a little more pretentious.

I guess it's a choice. Should one strive to create something universal (commercial) or not (fine)? I guess that's up to the artist. Sometime's it's nice to have positive feedback from the public, instead of that 1% who actually understand the importance of those things in museums.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Taiwan: First Impressions</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[[Old draft, posting anyway. More like a journal entry, but contains lots of shallow observations of Taiwanese people. It's quite important to know that I lived in America my entire life before coming to Taiwan.]

<strong>Disclaimer</strong>
This is completely subjective. Stereotypes are made.

<strong>Taiwanese people are happy</strong>
Taiwanese people are overall happy. Check the happy index on Wikipedia. All classes of society are happy. Not faking happy for the face of the company they work for. Real happiness.

Taiwanese people are very friendly. I thought perhaps it was my brown baby face, but the other hostel travelers agree. We've all had many situations in which a person went out of their way to help. One of the hostel travelers, Floor, watched fireworks for Valentine's day that occurred at a nearby river. When it was over, a family asked if he had dessert, they then proceeded to take him out to a desert shop that sold shaved ice with mango, and even paid for it. Another hostel traveler needed directions once and was given a ride on a scooter to their destination. I've similarly been helped several times. Just on the first day, I had trouble finding my hostel at night. I asked two kids pushing a closed food cart. They didn't know where, but they asked others and eventually found it. Another time, I asked for a certain bus station, a girl took five minutes to walk me to it. Furthermore, the bus driver insisted I didn't pay and made sure I got out at the right stop. Yet another time, I was asked by a mother of a family of three to join them for dinner, then out for a day trip the next day.  All of this within my first week in Taipei.

Typhoons come, people make mistakes, they forgive and they forget.

Nearly all of Taiwan is developed, yet ambition and competition is low, which is surprising for a developed country.

<strong>Taiwanese people are more organized, courteous, and protective</strong>
Taiwanese (and likely other East Asian) people are organized and courteous. On escalators, people who want to stand stay on the right side, people who want to walk, on the left. I've never seen anyone block a pathway. The same organization applies to vehicular traffic. I once saw a scooter get nudged by a mini pickup truck. The scooter curved off direction, stopped, looked back at the offending vehicle, then moved on. He shrugged off the incident as if it were a baby that dropped food.

Taiwanese people (and likely Asians in general) can sometimes be overly neat or organized. People wore raincoats during the water rapids ride. An entire family. They wanted to ride but didn't want the inconvenience of getting wet.

I thought about how my friend described Japanese subways. How extremely organized the people are. The train is packed yet no one makes a noise out of the courtesy of others. Japanese people (and likely other East Asians) care about others. They understand people are tired from work, and perhaps even expect the same from others. I haven't been on a Japanese subway, but I think I would become bored of such routinely commute. I'd wish for a Black American to be there. To make some noise. Add some excitement to it. Living in a homogeneous country, one appreciates diversity.

Two travelers from the hostel, Vidit and Floor told stories of their times in Korea in which there is a beach near Busan where there are buoys and helicopters to make sure Koreans do not pass a certain distance.

When the day market is over, the store owners clean their store front, and even the space around them, together, like a community. The same occurs when the night market is over. The same occurs, when the trash truck comes.

<em>The trash truck</em>
The trash truck deserves an essay of it's own. Taiwanese homeowners don't leave their trash out to rot. They keep it until the trash truck comes. The truck drives slowly around neighborhoods, and people are expected to bring the trash to it in a timely manner. When it comes, an American may mistake for an ice cream truck. It plays music, similar to the music that is played when school children are to clean up. People come out to throw their trash in the truck. There's a recycling bin and liquid waste bin too. The whole event is surprisingly communal. Neighbors come out, often hilariously chasing down the truck in their nightwear and flip flops. It's a moment of the day I cherish.

Gladly, Taiwanese people are still quite balanced. Taiwanese people remind me of the people of San Francisco, where people are also happy and will take time to help others, but likely have more money and fit the young professional category. In Taiwan, these good characteristics apply to all classes of society.

<strong>Media influence</strong>
The influence of media is astounding.

Like moths to a light bulb people are attracted to what is marketed to them. They take pictures of movie posters with their iPhones and upload to Facebook for their friends to see, not thinking about the films they could make with it. They play games on their smartphones during transportation, missing an opportunity to talk to a very interesting person in front of them.

Night markets rise every night in every area. People shop. It's often the same items everywhere, yet people still browse and buy things. It's natural; Consuming is a necessity of life.

Yet, I often felt that the consumption of the youth is quite high. Bubble tea, colorful clothes, giant fried chickens. Kids come out and enjoy. Many work at the night market, some with their parents. Or perhaps this is my perception because I was traveling and not living. I've been to a lot of night markets myself and enjoyed eating a stick of five boiled quail eggs and drinking a papaya milk shake. An alternative social scene? I've become tried of night markets, but if I were meeting some friends for a quick bite, it's quite convenient. It's fun.

<strong>Taiwanese people are healthy</strong>
There are very few fat people in Taiwan, yet they seemingly eat all the time, 5 or more meals a day. It's so hot and humid I never feel like eating. When I do, it's either meat or sugar, usually in the form of fried meat and tea.

Taiwanese people will tell you if you are fat. It’s not rude. It’s a problem that can be fixed. I love it.

<strong>JV's Hostel</strong>
[move to another more personal post]
I was a little apprehensive about the hostel. Everyone was so relaxed. I felt like an outsider. But the next day, I found it was just my perspective. And by the end of my second day, it felt like home.

The experiences I had during my stay at this hostel, my first days of travel, were some of the greatest moments in my life. It reminded what living is.

The people here were outstanding, the staff and the travelers.

The staff consisted of the pleasant owner and three girls working part-time during summer vacation. They lived fast pace lives, going to places, doing things, consuming, Facebooking, having a blast. They took the travelers out to places to eat, things to do, making sure everyone was having as much fun as they were. They're all smart too; two went to SFSU and were continuing studies in Taiwan. I was able to get close to one, have conversations about sociology, Taiwan, the Asian mentality, and life in general.

The crowd was diverse. In just three days I've met people from the Netherlands, Shanghai, Seoul, Arizona, The Bay Area, India, and Sweden.

One guy from the Netherlands seems to work for a few months to get money, then go out to travel again. One was there to renew a Korean visa while teaching there. Three girls from Korea were travelling Taipei for a week. One guy from Germany was seemingly wasting away. One girl from Berlin shared interests in contemporary writers, the contemporary art scene in big cities, and making bubble sculptures. One guy from US was able to find an English teaching job, find an apartment, and basically begin a new life. One guy from Guangzhou had the time of his life, thoroughly enjoying every moment away from his apparently boring life in China with restrictive parents. One girl found a job at a pet store and quit once she found out there were more dogs in smaller cages in the back of the store. One Australian guy was able to speak Chinese fluently, doing exchange for his language studies. 

During the time there, I didn't feel right. I was consuming as opposed to creating. I was becoming someone whom I previously despised, a mindless consumer. I was consuming too much. Yet, in hindsight, staying at this hostel is something I miss dearly and will never forget. The people I met here were all amazing. It was quickly apparent that my travels had to be about meeting people.

<strong>Taipei</strong>
I was surprised at how Taipei is to New York, or any other city. The same personalities, classes, consumerism, markets, etc. I think once you've lived in a city, a rural area, and a suburb, you've lived everywhere.

It's also surprising how easy it is to travel in a place where everything is written in a foreign language, and everyone speaks in a foreign language. The design of the metro system maps are very similar to any other. Color coded, designed well enough to understand. English where it's necessary.

I had a difficult time the first day, but the next day was somehow easier. All I needed to do was figure out how to get from the hostel to the main street on which the metro is. The street signs are difficult to find, so I remember by landmarks. Many times I don't know the landmark, but remember the sight once I see it. A smartphone isn't necessary; It's a little more fun to find the way to the destination asking people nearby to help, but it's also a waste of time when you need to be somewhere.

Downtowns are all the same -- big businesses, big banks, big brand shopping centers, big chain restaurants, but that's not all there is in a city.

Taipei is a microcosm of Taiwan. You can find everything you want from Taiwan here, or very close to it. Really, there's a hot spring a little north, the beach a little further, a mountain to the southeast, shops, neighborhoods. It's not as exciting as going to Guanziling hot spring, or Alishan, and it doesn't quite have the charm and pleasant weather of the east coast, but it's enough.

If you've been to a city, one could feel that there isn't much. It's mostly shopping and eating.  I'm not going to complete tourist destinations either. The city is repetitive; Night markets, giant malls of popular designers, random temples. Even other travelers at the hostel agree that there isn't much to see.

Once I digested the new things to me in Taiwan, my narrow interests to contemporary art events: an exhibition at the Museum of Contemporary Art, a performance at the Digital Art Center, an indie music and film festival at an abandoned building near the last subway stop to the east, and a playing of Metropolis at Huashan park with live music from an electronic duo from Europe. The city's contemporary art may not be as ambitious as New York, but it exists. Taiwan National University is the center of it, and venues and artist villages exist in Taipei. A friend mentioned the only other city with art is Kaohsiung, still, it doesn't compare to Taipei.

<strong> West coast; more cities</strong>
...

<strong> East coast</strong>
...

<strong>Other / temporary</strong>
Of course, this is my perception. A person who's lived a secluded life and then began living a normal life once I started travelling. Competitive by nature. Valuing fine art over time ]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Travel: Tips, Resources, and a Checklist</title>
		<link>http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/travel</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Introduction</h3>
This post is an ongoing list of travel tips, resources, and a pre-travel checklist. It was written because a friend asked for some tips and my response turned out to be very long, so long that I felt the effort belonged to a more permanent, more public place, like this blog.

Obligatory disclaimer: somethings written here are subjective and it's up to you to extract whatever you can from it. Actually, you should just stop researching and just go!

<h3>Checklist</h3>
I hate packing, but gladly, very little is necessary.

smartphone - It's nearly everything one needs to travel. It's a map, (Google maps), a compass, an internet browser, a camera, a video camera, a hotspot, an alarm clock, an e-book reader, and more.
check passport expiration date
check visa
limit bag weight to 20kg check-in and 7kg carry-on
call or use internet to inform debit and credit card companies of travels so that they do not block the card upon foreign transactions
check driver's license expiration date
check international driver's license expiration date
download and install everything you need (internet is going to suck)
composition book
notes application
inform embassy of travels through <a href="https://step.state.gov/STEP">Smart Traveller Enrollment Program</a> (STEP)
  - it sends current news through e-mail about the areas you are travelling to
otc stomach medicine (Pepto-Bismal)
mosquito spray
sun screen
become an EU citizen
  - able to live and work in 28 countries?

<h3>Pro-tips</h3>
Pros only.

Don't reserve accommodation.
Don't buy ongoing or return flights. Kinda risky? Can buy a "ghost" ticket.
Don't bring more than one backpack and daypack.

<h3>Visas</h3>
Oh if only every country handled this the same. Some countries have weird stipulations: Thailand allows 30 days by air, but only 15 by land. Also, make sure the visa is stamped upon entry and exit. Laos duped me; Luckily, I didn't have any cash to give them and they let me out.

<a href="http://travel.state.gov/">Travel.State.Gov</a> - for U.S. citizens, choose country, check the entry / exit requirements section
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visa_requirements_for_United_States_citizens">Visa requirements for United States citizens Wikipedia article</a> - easy to view, but may not be updated

Country specific:
<a href="http://www.forumosa.com/taiwan/viewtopic.php?f=35&t=103343">Taiwan</a> - a post that explains how ARCs, work permits, and visas work

Working holiday visas:
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_holiday_visa">Wikipedia article</a>
  - US does not participate in this
  - "There are opportunities for US citizens to work in Ireland, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea under similar bilateral programs, however."

<h3>Transportation</h3>
<h4>Air Travel</h4>
I used a combination of <a href="http://kayak.com/">Kayak</a> and <a href="http://www.skyscanner.com/">Skyscanner</a>. Skyscanner will find some funky cheap domestic flights that Kayak will miss. If the trip is short you may not need to book in advance to get a good rate. Flights through small airlines can be surprisingly cheap, like $20 flights to the Philippines through Cebu Pacific from nearby countries. I should give <a href="https://www.hipmunk.com/">Hipmunk</a> another try.

<h4>Motorcycle</h4>
I'd recommend riding a bike anywhere road conditions are somewhat decent. Motorcycles are the best form of transportation. No need to follow bus and train schedules, not limited to the developed towns public transportation goes; Swerve into random villages; Few things feel better than being on a motorcycle. If you can, buy a bike, make an overland trip, and sell it at the end.

Make sure to get an international driver's permit with a motorcycle stamp. It could be helpful to just get one without a motorcycle license. I was able to rent motorcycles throughout SE Asia with just a normal vehicle driver's license, and sometimes just a passport.

<h3>Accommodation</h3>
I used hostelbookers and hostelworld for more popular places. I never had to reserve a hostel, even during travelling season. Great hostels can make a huge difference. It could mean having helpful and knowledgable staff members, meeting interesting travelers, integrating with local people, having a lower chance of items being stolen. Hostels are an experience of their own. I've had really memorable times in them.

<a href="http://www.hostelbookers.com/">hostelbookers</a> - no fee for reservation, more technical user interface
<a href="http://www.hostelworld.com/">hostelworld</a> - charges fee for reservation, better user interface
<a href="http://www.tripadvisor.com/">tripadvisor</a> - more than just hostels
<a href="http://www.hostels.com/">hostels</a> - just hostels, really

<h3>Couchsurfing</h3>
Although it can serve as accommodation, it's about meeting people and culture exchange, therefore it deserves it's own category.

I <a href="https://www.couchsurfing.org/">couchsurfed</a> a few times in Taiwan and loved it. I usually don't feel like planning anything and want to wander about. Living through someone else is one the laziest and thus my favorite way to travel. It just requires some time ahead to communicate and set dates. If you have the time to plan, I highly recommend it.

<h3>Work</h3>
Oh so much to do. Just choose and go!

<h4>Volunteering and Work Exchange</h4>
I highly recommend this too. Travelling too fast is detrimental to social life, unless you're able to control yourself and Skype with friends and family at home frequently. Living in one place, developing relationships. It's just good.

I also didn't want to tie myself to an ESL gig for 6 months or a year, so instead I found an English teaching position on helpx for two weeks, which turned into two months.

Both sites are about the same. You can see helpx posts without paying. Workaway requires you to pay before seeing.

<a href="http://www.helpx.net/">helpx</a>
<a href="http://www.workaway.info/">workaway</a>

<a href="http://www.wwoof.org/">WWOOF</a> - limited to organic farming

<h4>English as a Second Language (ESL)</h4>
Teaching English is a financially safe and logistically easy way to live in another country. A lot of people do this. Although safe and easy, it's a real job that takes time and effort, 30-40+ hours a week. I believe you should try to do what you want. Be bold. Never compromise for financial safety.

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teaching_English_as_a_foreign_language">Wikipedia article</a>

<h3>Communication</h3>
The cheapest route is to just use an online service. If people need to contact you on demand, get a local or international SIM card, which should have free incoming calls. Of course, a GSM phone is needed.

Google Voice - voice over IP service. I ported my number to it before travelling, but I believe they give out free numbers too. My number is from the US, so I am able to use it to call US to US for free. Costs $20 to port my number. It worked with Verizon.  About $0.02/minute to mobile devices in other countries. [todo: can I call my Google Voice number from a foreign phone, and relay a call?]
Talkatone - an iPhone app to make calls through Google Voice
Skype - free voice over IP service including video and instant messaging
Facetime - also free voice over IP service including video?
Prepaid SIM cards - can be really cheap, has free incoming call
  - <a href="http://www.forumosa.com/taiwan/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=103629">Taiwan</a>
  - Thailand
    - DTAC - $20 per month for unlimited 3G data which I heavily tethered. It was amazing.
International SIM cards - World SIM, OneSimCard, TravelSim. I haven't tried these, but it seems enticing for an all-in-one solution.
  - India
    - Airtel - I bought the 3GB then unlimited plan, tethered it a few times, and still haven't used it up. It's fast. I don't know how slow it will become once I use up the 3GB.

<h3>Finance</h3>
I'm broke. You probably shouldn't listen to me here.

<h4>Purchases</h4>
Use a credit card without foreign transaction fees when possible. If not, use cash. Avoid Dynamic Currency Conversion (DCC) -- When a merchant asks to convert to your currency, say no, charge in the current currency you're purchasing from.

Visa and mastercard exchange rates are much lower than banks, and much much lower than airports and hotels. 0.15% to 1.00% according to Visa's website.

Credit card rewards programs are gibberish. I calculated that a 2% cash-back card trumps most travel cards, and it's more convenient.

<h4>Withdrawals</h4>
Check the foreign transaction fee on your debit or ATM cards. Call your company, ask them if they can waive it during your trip. If not, try to get one without a fee. It's usually 1%, 2%, 3%, or $5. Smaller banks have better rates.

Currency exchange rates:
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=exchange+rate">Google</a>
<a href="http://corporate.visa.com/pd/consumer_services/consumer_ex_rates.jsp">Visa</a>
<a href="https://www.mastercard.com/global/currencyconversion/index.html">MasterCard</a>

<h3>Vaccinations</h3>
Call your physician and use health insurance. Call your local public health department and use health insurance. Travel clinics should be the last choice, as they are the most expensive and often do not use health insurance.

<a href="http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/list.htm">Center for Disease Control and Prevention country list</a> - contains routine and regional recommended vaccinations

<h4>Antimalarials</h4>
For long-term, the intake any antimalarials will likely display side effects. Taking none and avoiding mosquito bites seems like the best option. It's not worth the side effects or money. It's possibly overblown by overly cautious Westerners and drug companies. Besides, it's curable.

For short-term, Atovaquone / Proguanil seems like the best option. Can use Cholorquine in areas where mosquitos are not resistant to it.

I'm not sure if it's okay to change medicine.

Chloroquine:
Cheap. Low side effects, and family uses it without problems. Resisted in many areas.

Atovaquone/Proguanil (Malarone, Malanil):
Expensive ($4/daily pill). Low side effects. Difficult to find in non-industrialized countries.

Doxycycline:
Cheap. Tetracyclines are a general antibiotic which works against several diseases. Might be causing me digestion problems.

Mefloquine:
Kinda scary to me, as it has psychological and neurological side effects. The local doctor prescribed me this, but I'll likely cancel it.

My experience:
I took one before going to North Thailand, and I don't recommend it. I don't think it's worth, in side effects and cost, taking any anti-malarial for long-term travelling.

I started taking Doxycycline once I knew I was going to bike through northwest Thailand. The medicine had few side effects and was noted as a helpful general antibiotic. It was causing indigestion and heartburn by the time I got to India. I think it was also screwing up my taste.

My family take Choloquine, and they say that they never had problems with it. It didn't make sense to take that medicine either as the mosquitos in India are resistant to it.

<h3>Travel Resources</h3>
There's a lot of guides, but remember to use it as just that: a guide. Choose your own path.

		<title>An analysis of a playtest on kids and thoughts about designing games for a large audience</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I let my family's domestic worker family's son in India and his friend play some iPad games: Fingle, Shot Shot Shoot, SpellTower, and Singing Fingers. It turned out to be a really interesting experiment.

Despite them being a little uncreative, they enjoyed all of the games. The only problem was I had to guide them a bit on learning how to play each game. I would say they enjoyed the games in the following order: Fingle, Shot Shot Shoot, Singing Fingers, SpellTower.

Fingle, by far, was a winner. They quickly learned (with guidance, and the constant enforcement of the using one hand rule) and said, "this would be fun to play with a girl". Still, the two male kids enjoyed playing. They laughed at the sound of moaning after accomplishing a level. I feel the game worked because it doesn't require much creativity from them. There is a clear goal, and they do it.

Shot Shot Shoot was fun. When I played against either one of them, I won 90% of the time because they just didn't have the capacity for building a strategy. When they played each other, they were reckless. They cared about winning, but there was little to no learning going on.

Singing fingers was short lived. After I taught them the mechanics of Singing Fingers by demonstration "helooooo", they mimicked me and said "hellooooo" and then nearly closed it. I then showed them that they could make sounds of different pitches and play them in a tune or simultaneously. Then they got excited. Still, that only extended the gameplay another two minutes for them.

SpellTower went pretty well too, but I think they just lacked English vocabulary. That and puzzle games just aren't fun. Okay, this is a personal bias. I don't play puzzle games. Some people love Tetris, Lumines, and Super Puzzle Fighter; My brain turns off while playing them. I'll consider this game as disqualified.

<strong>What happened?</strong>
Without a goal, some people will stop playing and move on to something else. Maybe they lack attention, don't care, or just aren't curious enough. In order for a game to be popular, the idea has to click within the first minute, or else they'll move on to something else.

This is a problem. Hugely popular social network games tackled this by adding hand-holding tutorials in the form of dialog boxes. Independent game designers emerged and said tutorial are stupid and that the player should learn by playing. I imagine the direct contrast to those old social network games is Shadow of the Colossus. That game nearly has no directions. It asks the player to figure out what to do, by, well, playing!

None of the games I playtested were learned by the players by themselves. I allowed time for each game, but none of them captured their attention long enough. They simply asked what they should do. Sometimes they touched anything that resembled "Okay" until they came to a screen had enough things moving to resemble a game screen (was this conditioned by social network games?). Once there, they touched a few times, gave up, and closed the game.

Sure, teaching people how to play defeats the purpose of play, but should a line be drawn between the curious, patient, and intelligent people from the rest or should game designers strive to teach everyone?

Even after I taught the kids the basis of each game they struggled to progress in each one. No strategy was created in Shot Shot Shoot and no creativity existed in Singing Fingers. Fingle however was played until they had to leave.

<strong>What does this mean?</strong>
I think this playtest kinda revived mechanical games for me. Fingle is amazing, simply for its mechanics. Once the basics are learned, the players know how to play the game entirely. New mechanics are not progressively added, so the players are not constantly learning, and so a constant tutorial is not needed. You put the solid white block in the dashed white outline (another sexual metaphor?). Progress is shown through levels rather than mechanics. Sure, there wasn't major thinking or learning going on, but they had fun. Mechanically-heavy digital games, like the board games that precede it have a universal audience. That's kinda powerful.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Using Scribblenauts as a Teaching Device</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[A family friend of mine in India has been using my iPad to use Facebook for the past two days. He's in high school. I think he's got the gist of Facebook, which is better than his Google skills and his concept of the internet. In the past, I let him <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/an-analysis-of-a-playtest-on-kids" title="An analysis of a playtest on kids and thoughts about designing games for a large audience">play a few games on it</a>. Just now, I showed him Scribblenauts Remix. It was an interesting experience.

He doesn't know English well and his spelling is very poor. I didn't know this until he spelled boy "boiii" and ball "bol". I had play with him: to teach him how to play, to translate the goal of each level, to talk about how to solve each level, to help spell out his solutions, and to help deal with the poor game interactions. Although I was guiding him through the game, there was a constant stream of new content: a new English word (axe, ladder), a new object (masquerade mask), a new concept (evolution, extinction events). In parallel, there was a constant stream of learning taking place. The game naturally brought up discussions about the new content, mistranslations, and puzzle solutions. Playing this game turned out to be a really fun teaching experience.

I think this game makes for an awesome teaching device. I totally recommend playing it with any child or foreign teenager, or anyone who wants to learn some English vocabulary! Super Scribblenauts and Scribblenauts Unlimited add adjectives to the game, making it an even better English learning device.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Creativity Derives from Nothing</title>

<blockquote>In the past, whenever I watched a great film, I worked harder, my ambitions grew, it cleared my head of all of the silly small things, like a good scooter ride. It kept me in direction, and that direction is creating great films. But isn't that because I'm consuming it? Copying. Creating what I'm consuming. That's wrong, isn't it? Is it right to copy something you love?</blockquote>

Creativity. Creating something. How does one create something? Well, it's easy to create something like something else, just copy, but that's not very creative. I think the amount of creativity could be measured by how dissimilar it is to everything else, and is probably how fine art is judged. How does one create something like nothing else? How does on achieve pure creativity?

If one's resulting creations aren't very creative, then perhaps the creative process was affected by one's experience with the medium. Consuming media does not always affect creativity positively. A person who has vast knowledge in fine art does not make one more creative than one who does not. The consumption of art may affect the person negatively, as the person may be more inclined to create something like something they really like, or copy.

A recurring thought I've had: If one lived in humanly sustainable vacuum, a world where there is very little, that person would be extremely creative.

In the past, I stayed up late nights, consumed lots of media, avoided normal life activities, replacing them with films. As a result, I spoiled myself with fine art. For example, I wanted to create films with social realism, in a contemporary foreign setting, with long takes, and other characteristics I liked in art films. I also wanted to avoid things I disliked in pop films. Although I have taste, I like and dislike certains things, I don't think it positively affected my creativity. Perhaps I now know what I want to make and what I don't want to make, but avoiding the consumption of films altogether I wouldn't have to avoid anything, and I wouldn't be copying anyone, and it would have resulted in a better creation.

Now, after consuming very little media while travelling, then glancing at media, I find everything extremely uncreative in every aspect. I wonder why anyone would make such a thing. Of course, I know this because I consumed a lot of media in the past, I know what exists, but still, I feel a huge difference in the amount of creativity of media.

For example, I just listened to "Long. Live. A$AP" after not listening to music for some time. I felt that it's crazy how limited the rap music is. Only Western people can understand the references. The sounds are generated from popular drum machines. I wouldn't ever want to limit myself to a certain culture, or especially a genre. A thought is resurfaces: creativity is affected by your recent surroundings. A temporary solution: live in places where artists don't live.

Consumption is a necessity in life. Travelling is a form of consumption. Instead of consuming art, I think it's better to consume life. Explore places, eat something new, cook something new, play with friends, tend to family, explore people's minds, create relationships, deepen relationships, create something with others, consume something with others, talk to people, observe nature, try a new job, try a new hobby, learn a new language. Live life, then create something from it. Perhaps these are the greatest derivatives of creativity: personal experiences.

In order to achieve pure creativity, one must remind oneself to do the following: starve oneself from art (at least the medium), start from nothing (or something minute), and live life. Then, create something from it.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Humans have <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_human_needs">fundamental human needs</a>. People in undeveloped countries live the same as the people in developed countries do, the only difference is the environment, including money, and with money comes the prevalence of technology.

Technology reduces and sometimes entirely replaces work in developed countries. Touting is replaced by internet and television advertisements. Launderers are replaced by laundry machines. Convenience stores replaced by vending machines. The person on the bus who takes your money and yells the bus's destination is replaced by a transportation card system and electronic marquee. Furthermore, buses and bus drivers are replaced by a metro station with even more electronic stuff. Perhaps transportation will be replaced by teleporters or apparition.

The reduction of work saves people time and energy. That's great, but technology reduces more than just work, it reduces the quality of communication. Talking face-to-face is replaced by phone calls. Phone calls replaced by e-mails and instant messaging. E-mails and instant messaging combined with other mediums to create Facebook. The method of communication requiring less and less energy. Communication time increases at the cost of quality.

Quality time. The time you help your mother cool a meal. The time you play games with your kids. The time you ask your siblings how they are doing.

Many middle and upper class jobs exist in the confines of an office. They spend 30 hours or more on computers at their job. They use their smartphones on the subway to either play no-brainer games, check e-mails thoughtlessly, or check Facebook. At home, they watch TV or use their computer to check Facebook. Sometimes, people post things found on the internet on Facebook!

In this white collar life, I believe intelligent stimulation does occur, or else the job turnover would be higher. It's even possible to live a very stimulating life. One can consume fine arts, create a complex computer application at their job, share narrow interests with a narrow crowd (SF jab?). It's the social stimulation that is sacrificed. Many of the fundamental human needs are related to communication. Quality time is sacrificed.

Along with quality communication with people, quality time spent alone is sacrificed. Sunlight, nature, space, allowing one to think freely. This is also reduced in the white collar life.

The allocation of time in one's life, the constant valuation, the balancing of life is my greatest problem.

I haven't written a blog for quite some time because I've been living in South Asian countries, communicating to the people around me, without technology. On my first day in Seoul, a highly developed country, I already feel lonely enough to write this blog post (Seoul deserves a post of it's own).

Of course, there are pros in communication. People share specific interests: online communities. People around the world share knowledge: Wikipedia. Friends and family can see your recent photos and major events on Facebook. It requires attention to to solely use technology for functional purposes, but it's possible. One can solve nearly every problem leveraging the internet, but there are few problems that can only be solved without it.

Note and Disclaimer:
After middle school, I spent a lot of time on the computer. I took two office jobs as a programmer. After that I began creating physically social games. Then I travelled Asia. There's some personal angst in here, especially related to my current travel move to Seoul.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>written on 7/2013:</strong>
Chinatown has taken over Manhattan and renamed itself Hong Kong.

Manhattan, and maybe some bland neighborhood in west Brooklyn. A financial district (HK island), a shopping district (Kowloon [Tsim Sha Tsui, Mong Kok]), and some small towns (New Territories). That's it. Well, that's all I was able to see in eleven days.

Even the people seem like New Yorkers; They're gritty, hard-working, uncaring. The people are from the southern region of China, Guangzhou, formerly Canton. They are the businessmen of China. The ones who immigrate directly into the heart of Western cities: New York, San Francisco, Kuala Lumpur.

Most housing and businesses are in giant buildings. From the street one cannot see what's going on inside of them. From the street one cannot see the sky as the floors above the first protrude over the sidewalk, saving people from rain, depriving them of sunshine. It contrasts with India in which you are able to see how people live and work on street level: a mother is washing her clothes, a man is selling wares, a boy is cooking Chinese food from a food stand named Ching Chong Chinese Food. In Hong Kong, there is seemingly nothing going on on the streets. People are either walking to or from work, or shopping at a leisurely pace. Only at rush hour can a majority of the people be found. There's no point of wondering in this city. There's no life in sight.

It seems there is nothing to do here but work. Or at least, that's what's visible. The work seems tough by the general mood of the working people. Likely, 8-10 hour days. Little happiness. Paid a little more than they're expenses for rent and food. If one lives too far from the city, the commute and work can take up an entire day. They live closer to the city to fight for minutes of life. All one can do is work and go home to live.

Despite the numerous people that live there, the city is devoid of life. No one has time to share. I see no reason for people without sufficient income to live here. A better life can be had in a less developed country. One life of a person in India compares to 10 lives in Hong Kong.

The food outside is of low quality, severely lacking vegetables, and often overly salty or sugary. "Fast food". It's cooked quickly and eaten quickly. One has to cook at home to eat healthily and cost-effectively. Food is a part of life, and it's quality can be used as a measurement of quality of life.

Perhaps on their holidays they go to the Kowloon or Hong Kong island to shop, or to an island to get away from it all, but they're not going very far. People often don't go far to consume. A new phone accessory is satisfying enough. Some people take trips to other countries close in proximity for a few days. It gives them a little more life to continue work.

After coming from India, I find it difficult to meet local people, create connections. There are too many people in my building. All I know are the people in my room and the hostel receptionist. The city can be a lonely place. Artists create more in cities because there's less life to live. I have to resort using the computer to find people. It's a shame. I enjoy getting along with anyone around me.

A place like this can transform it's inhabitant. Take the life of that person away, transform them into a working person, a selfish person, a cog. A person who's eyes and mind are focused on few things, ignoring everything around them. This makes it an inhospitable place. I had to spend a lot of time searching for hostels, changing hostels, and only found respite in a Sikh temple, where a more communal life could be found, and the airport. I was able to find more heart in the ugliest of cities: Jaipur, Delhi, Kuala Lumpur, Kathmandu. When I was a cog, I hope I wasn't this inhospitable.

The money pressures people. It controls people. A life can be trapped working their entire life.

Even away from Kowloon, Hong Kong is an expensive place to live. Artists struggle to find cheap rent. Artists aren't well-supported by the government or businesses. Creativity is obviously severely lacking. The business here is completely financial. Startup companies need a two year business plan and are not provided seed money. Great people have to go in debt to do anything valuable here.

I wonder if minorities of China, people who aren't able to make much money, work here. I've only heard of Filipino and Indonesian workers doing domestic work. One of the most interesting parts of Western cities are ethnic enclaves. The lack of diversity creates a conformist society.

To make up for life, people consume media: films, music, television. People on the street and on subways are looking down at their smartphone. Their smartphone provides them with life. This reminds me of myself when I was working. I used socially realistic films to stimulate life in me. Films can display so much life in two hours. Two hours is all people have here. I narrow my goal. I want to make films that remind people of life. To live life. To take time to think, to live, in hopes that they spend more quality time with people.

An aside and opinion:
I actually had a good time. I met and had great conversations with a few people in my hostel and with people from the School of Create Media in City University of Hong Kong and a few art organizations, but even they want to get out, and without them, I have no reason to be there. The reason I moved out of South Asia is because it lacked like-minded people. If there is neither like-minded people or culture, the place has nothing of interest for me. This is no a place for an artist to thrive. Studios are commercial. There are no artist communities. People work selfishly in commercial studios. It takes effort to get out of the city and enjoy some space. Wandering around this city is depressing. It lacks culture. It lacks areas that have a small town feel. Cantonese and written Chinese is limited and requires a lot of time to learn. There are better choices in East Asia.


<strong>written on 3/23</strong>
The following are passages from my diary, in order, without a timestamp:

day 1:
The money pressures people to work. One has to be careful to take time and choose their work strategically, whilst doing creative work.

There's nothing to do here but work. Well, maybe not, could be the money pressuring me [to observe quickly].

It's a contrast to India, where people <em>live</em>. Perhaps only the young professional class work. The older people learned how to balance life and work. [*this was empirically disproven].

I need to avoid becoming a directionless wanderer and keep my high standards.

day 2:
I went around Mong Kok, it's a child's place, like mid-town.

I'm still moving slowly, at a depressing pace. I need to be around excited people. I need Babycastles.

I'd rather contract work from India and small towns around the world than work in this city.

It's only been a day in a touristy part though. Perhaps I will be able to find people, see traditional life, CouchSurf.

Perhaps all cities are the same. I lost my care for them, which was already limited to contemporary art.

I want to live, at home, a place where I cook, then go out to explore, to work in open spaces. I want to work with people. Collaborate. I need to get motivated again. I've lost my self-motivation long ago [sometime in India].

If I do work it has to be meaningful. No compromise. Health, education, technology, humanitarianism. I need to create my own path.

Place yourself in an exciting place. Surround yourself with people. Great people.

day 3:
Hostel was booked for the weekend. Went to a Sikh temple. Able to stay for two days. Wasted 4 hours packing, transporting, and waiting. Need a solid place to stay to get anything done.

I still don't have the lust to work. I've been merely living for too long. Lazily. To get the lust, I ned to see hardship, dramatic films. I transform into what I consume. I'm unable to be myself. Consume nothing. Live.

I've been avoiding the use of computer, but it is needed to maintain the direction I want: film, game, contemporary art.

Perhaps hardships of cities and dramatic films inspired me in the past.

I need to create direction. I'm juggling too much: exploring the city, meeting people, making games. I'm living a balanced life when that doesn't work in a city if you want to make something great. OR does it?

Although I am not overly excited, I'm quite focused. I just need to continue calmly...This is still much better than doing nothing in India. I'm just doing nothing in another country.

Now that I hear people talk, I care less. I should care, but one must manage time like a business man. I can't satisfy everyone. Need to focus on what's important at this moment in time.

Hong Kong is not interesting at all thus far. I guess it's because I've seen it. It's New York with Chinese people. Just [the ugly parts] mid-town, financial center, and that bland neighborhood in West Brooklyn. Compared to Bhaktapur and Baroda, this place is extremely bland. No wonder people look to media to consume something. It's also no wonder artists create things here. They are limited.

day 4:
This Sikh temple is a respite from Hong Kong. The people are talkative, helpful. The food is delicious.

In the midst of last night, I decided to be a film-maker:
Film is a medium that displays life in its rawest form: video and audio. Hopefully more senses in the future.

Yes. Become a filmmaker. The time is now. Join or create a studio. That is your goal. It always was.

Games are cool. They impacted my life by providing great social times. They're fun to think about. Yet, it's nowhere near powerful as film.

Just keep making films. Don't stop. Ones about life.

...

Day 11:
Alan is a futurist, whereas I've been living in the past.

I become what I consume.

Lazy day. Overslept. Overtalked. Overcomputered. Lazy Sunday. Maybe I needed the sleep. Or, maybe I was done with Hong Kong, read to plan South Korea. Planning is when I feel I am doing nothing. I'm glad this only occurred on the last day, as opposed to a month [referring to time in India].

I feel out of place. Not wanting to consume.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Seoul is the result of conservative middle and upper class Asians living together, isolated from the rest of the world. I grew up with these people. I despised these people. It was the reason I started writing down my thoughts. It was the reason I left my hometown.

There are no distinct areas. It's a city-surburb sprawl. Franchises, shopping malls, restaurants, bars, clubs, and more shopping malls are at the center of each city-suburb. Apartment buildings, offices, and even large houses occupy the surrounding area. The city repeats itself. Six lane streets connect them all, filled with luxury cars alongside a great metro system and bus system. Seoul makes the Asian ethnic enclaves in Western cities seem more traditional. At least Hong Kong is efficient. Seoul is just wasteful.

My hostel feels like an and upper class Asian's house: wooden floors, a random marble staircase, IKEA-like furniture, modern computers, rainfall shower head, air conditioner and lights on all day, a refrigerator full of packaged food and drinks. It's neat, organized, uncreative, unnecessary.

The city is completely indoors. Subways lead to giant shopping malls. Large open spaces, indoors. There's more indoor space than parks. Indoor areas have air conditioner, wifi, tea, and water, everything needed for a person to use a computer. People that live in houses traverse the city in luxury cars as if the city were a suburb. Farmer's markets are indoors. Is this the future?

The influx of recent wealth is immediately apparent. Gungnam Style is real. Everyone has a smartphone, trendy clothes, excess cash for Starbucks coffee, excess time to go drinking and clubbing. They form tight cliques, use technology to communicate with their clique, wear branded clothing to signify status. Conformity is at large.

The city feels like it was built by Disney. People are pampered. Helicopters watch for people swimming at sea. Families and friends travel in large tour-guided groups, afraid of, well, everything. Kids never grow up here. Their parents wouldn't kick them out of their house after high school, or when they're thirty. It's overly comfortable.

Exploration is unwanted. Do artists leave this place?

Consumption is a human need, but the consumption here is heavily affected by media. They love brands. The people here are homebodies, so the power of media is amplified.

Branded companies rule here. Internet companies have wifi spots within retail stores. The metro station card works at retail stores. Companies sponsor popular events. The majority work for companies. Samsung is prevalent. Nearly every electronic appliance, smartphone, and computer in this hostel is made by Samsung.

Many people try to become the people they see in media. They dislike their appearance, wear make-up, high heel shoes, spend more time washing their face, lift weights, possibly use plastic surgery.

I don't belong here. I don't want to be here. I got away from these people long ago. Will I be able to enjoy time spent with them again? Will I be able to value my time with them? Well, I hope this is just the ugly side I am seeing. Every race has its cons.

I've lost the feeling of being on edge, alert. It's making me lazy. I perform better when I am struggling, fighting for something.

All I see is waste. Perhaps it's because I was living in South Asia. I enjoyed the minimalism of living in India and Nepal, spending time and interacting with local people in the same physical location. It's conducive to creativity. It's conducive to living a real life.

Korea brings about the lonely side of me. The use of media and computers resurges. I have to use computers to talk to find and talk to certain people. I have to commute through hordes of coffee shops to reach park, library, or friend. I have to use media to remind myself that there is more to the world than this, to surround myself with things I value. I need to create my own space, distancing myself from the people around me.

All is not negative. It's only my third day. I am living in the party area, so it's admittedly a bad gauge. I met a great person at a restaurant nearby. She works with her mother. It felt like being in my cousin's kitchen. The food is one of the most healthiest and tastiest meals I've had during my entire trip.

Korean people are actually really nice, just shy and not outgoing. I look forward to meeting more people here. It's going to require me to be very outgoing, learn some Korean, and possibly hitchhiking. I need to push myself into these people. Break the safety barrier they created around themselves. Somehow become friends with them, without becoming one of them.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Lost in Pursuit of the Unknown</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The initial, pleasurable moment fades. One is left to choose direction, again. Continue or try something new? Trying something new means quitting. Continuing in this direction lacks excitement. One begins to question their previous choices. Why did one choose to come here. What was one looking for?

One feels lost. Alone.

This is a universal situation that one reaches at some point in several perspectives. Two of which I've encountered: art and travel.

In art, the design portion is satisfying, with immediate feedback. After working on the design alone for some time, I question my direction, perhaps going off-course a bit. The work becomes drudgery. Social life is greatly hindered as most of the time goes to work.

In travel, exploring a new area is satisfying: meeting people, consuming together, absorbing a new culture, new environments. After taking it all in, the excitement begins to fade.

I look down, away from the world. I close myself off, less likely to have social encounters. I stop meeting people. I stop contacting friends. One feel there is no one to relate.

Continue or try something new?

Trying something new is quitting, usually. To continue one has to fix the problem. The problem is simple; One has an unhealthy social life. To fix it, one has to maintain social connections.

Another person can provide verification that your art is going in the right direction. It's nice to share the pursuit. The chance of a team to finish a project increases with the number of people in it.

To stay in one place, one needs long-term relationships. People to work with, talk to, to consume with.

As a nomad who continually travels, meets people, and takes on then interested jobs, this situation has reoccured several times. I've moved several times, severed several social ties, and worked several jobs.

Then, while pondering what went wrong, I think of this. I consume life: talk with someone, watch a movie, travel. I fill my agenda with social events. I create projects. I meet people. I talk to old friends. I become open. I become excited again.

Both feelings are temporary.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I met a special person at my hostel in Korea. After having a conversation with him, I was surprised by his intelligence, and then curious of its source.

He's the type who often drinks, watches movies, and is caring to everyone. He told me that he only learns by doing, empiricism. He travels. He'd rather be a laborer than an office worker. He doesn't have specialized skills. He's took farm jobs while using his Austrailian working visa. He enjoys talking to people, learning about culture through conversation. He dislikes clubs, people who don't learn new cultures, conservative people, therefore, many Koreans. He has witty black humor. "I enjoys bars because people I can hear people. In clubs people talk with their dicks." We talked about cultures. How Korea and Japan are similar, in that they are safe, close-minded, not willing to travel [without a tour guide]. We dreamt of owning a hostel.

How can a person who doesn't own a computer be so intelligent? Computers give people the access to infinite information. Isn't the consumption of information how people learn? If schools measure intelligence by memorization, he could be deemed stupid.

I then read a note I underlined from a Fluxus exhibition at Nam June Paik Art Center:
<blockquote>"Learning through conversation, inquiries, group play, and games servers the most effective educational model for the future generations who will in the knowledge and information society."</blockquote>

This person and most travelers use similar methods for learning. Learning by doing, living, and exploring.

Fluxus seeks to recreate the experience of learning by mimicking life. They created an exhibition which required visitors to play using all of their senses, resulting in a social and intelligent experiences.

Jon and Ching, a couple who runs a private school in Taiwan of which I volunteered for teacheing, cooks, feeds, plays with, and cares for students in every aspect of their lives. Classes only make up about 25% of the day. The rest is allocated in reinforcement and normal life activities: group games to aid memorization; artificial conversations to aid English classes; exercise via sports or martial arts; interacting with foreigners for real application; real conversations; cooking, cleaning, and time off. Kids questioned foreigner teachers and explored nearby parks and playground on their own [, under supervision]. Foreign teachers were given freedom to teach anything they wished. They successfully created an amazing educational environment.

Babycastles creates arcades for visitors to play. You enter an arcade. Play a new game with strangers. Enjoy. Explore. Talk about it. The experience is real as required senses. The experience is memorable because it was shared with people. As a result, the experience is fun. Something was really learned, and it will be remembered.

Of course, professors, books, and the internet is not bad, but alone they are not enough. Even reinforcement activities are not enough. It's missing somethings that is often required in order for people to really learn rather than memorize: conversation, inquiries, group play, and games.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Thoughts on Building a Playground for Adults</title>
		<link>http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/thoughts-on-building-a-playground-for-adults</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Disclaimer: Like most of the shit I write, it's written in one sitting, unedited.

As a curious person who's recently consumed more than anyone ever should, I've been thinking about an idyllic place where people learn, share, and play. The ideal playground, but for adults and children alike.

Why create a playground? People know the world is a playground, yet, sometimes it doesn't feel that way so people go to places or do things which help remind them of this. A playground a place where you feel free, where you can do whatever you want, with friends, with strangers, without constraints. The result of play could simply clear one's head of the day's work, or it could lead to valuable conversation, ideas, all of it shared with people.

Taking from the Wikipedia page, I concur that "personal development may be gained through the enhancement of skills, such as playing, communicating and cooperating with other children and adults in the playground."

As a child I explored suburbia, often with friends. We'd explore nearby neighborhoods on our single-gear bikes, play playground games such a tag and variants we'd make up, play sports, catch tadpoles. We'd make bike ramps. We'd take sneak my Dad's BB gun and shoot bottles. We were all quite competitive too. We'd see who can reach the furthest distance jumping off a swing without breaking a leg. We'd wrestle. We'd race everywhere. We'd talk. We'd fight. We'd finish homework early to maximize play time. We'd ace tests. The world was ours.

As people get old, take a job, have a family, the feeling gets lost somewhere. The world isn't so playful anywhere. The child becomes an inner child. The inner child goes deep.

I want to help elder people find their inner child, so that they enjoy exploring and creating again in hope that they regain the energy and confidence to do bolder things in life.

There are certain places that feel more playful than others though. Natural places and more playful than cities. People in small towns are more playful than city people. People in hostels, cafes, and bars are more likely to engage in conversation with people that they haven't met.. These are spaces where people spend their free time and are more likely to socialize, and play.

Play isn't always valuable though. It's possible nothing is gained from play. Playing flip cup or a video game repetitively without intelligent conversation or sufficient competition is probably not a good use of time. In addition, excessive play is valueless too. Play has to be limited by time: play time. The space has to contain things that are conducive to creativity and learning.

The ideal playground should attract all kinds of people. People in cities use meetup.com and local events of particular interest, but it narrows the audience, which is kind of the point of it. People in small towns simply go to a local public place: a bar, a plaza, a cafe. There's value in both places. One can meet a like-minded individual at the meetup, but meeting these people too often may lose value. Given that one is quite optimistic, one can extract a lot of value from people in a public place as it's more diverse, and the customers rotate.

One of my favorite forms of current adults playgrounds are science museums. Allow adults to drink and sit at a science museum, change up the exhibited objects during intervals, and bam! A pretty good adult playground. Well, that's a good start at least.

Science may not be interesting to everyone. It should be renamed to something less sciency and more playful, neither targeted toward adults or children, and not limited to edutainment.

It should be free, available to the public, open most of the day and night.

It should be a mix of educational entertainment and non-educational entertainment (competitive?), a bar and cafe, an outdoors area. Hmm, maybe that's too large.

Meh, that's enough for now. Maybe I'm over-evaluating life, again.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I was observing the sloth-like inhabitants of a 찜질방 [jjimjibang] in 춘천 [Chuncheon], 대한민국 [Daehan Minguk/South Korea]. I thought these people only existed in bathhouses in films set in feudal times, yet, here they were. The generation gap between these people and the people at the hostel I stayed at in 서울 [Seoul] was akin to the one in Tokyo Story. I wondered how people could conspicuously consume media to such a degree, how people could conform so much. Just being there, it became clear that Korean and Japanese people are insular, prey to popular media (MMORPGS, television, and manga), unsocial, timely like machines. I wondered if they contained any direction, ambition, or excitement.

There was only one guy who stood out from the crowd: a university aged kid with scruffy shoulder-length hair and hipster glasses. He was reading and writing with vigor and good posture. We were the only two people that didn't have the posture of a snorlax. We made eye contact, but I decided not to approach him as he was with his family.

At a later point, when he moved to a seat away from his family, I approached him. I asked 실러합니다, 연어 헐 수 이ㅆ어요 [excuse me, do you speak English]? He energetically mentioned something about his Android phone charging, thinking that I wanted to charge my iPhone and gestured that I couldn't because the second socket was taped up. I concluded that my Korean pronunciation was terrible.

We then spoke in English. I asked if he was from here [춘천/Chuncheon]. He blurted out that he is going to the army at 2PM tomorrow. Then I noticed he wasn't excited, he was frightened. He then spilled out all of his emotions, or at least as much as he could express at his English level. He told me that when he told his girlfriend that he was going to the army, she broke up. He said he finished his freshman year in college. He's 23. He told me couldn't afford to go to graduate school [to avoid conscription]. He said they're going to shave his head tomorrow. He blurted he plays the guitar.

It was 1AM and the people around us were sleeping so I directed to move the conversation to the locker room. It provided a much needed small penis humor.

We continued to talk. He said he loves to play games -- League of Legends, Minecraft, and Starcraft. "The good old days". He continually pulls his hair up in stress, takes off his glasses, washes his face of the occasional tears. He said he wants to cry, but can't. I asked what he's afraid of. He said will be unable to contact anyone, perhaps one or two days per month, if he's lucky. He's said going to miss his family, girlfriend, and that he just wants to play the guitar and games with his friends. He said that the time [two years] is going to waste [he gestures toward the trash can]. He just wants to live.

He asked about me. I answered. When I mentioned that I'm going to Japan next, he said it's dangerous. He felt that the nuclear radiation form the meltdown at Fukushima affects all of Japan. He later mentioned an island that is disputed between Korea and Japan [독도/獨島/Dokdo], saying that he does not like Japan because of the situation.

He thought I was brave to travel alone, to move and work in different cities. He said he is a coward. When people fight, he becomes frightened.

He asked what I thought about South Korea. I said it's nice, but it has its cons due to the lack of diversity, and especially after hearing his situation, I appreciate America more. He said he wants to go to America.

He mentions that there is going to be a star fall at 3AM. He and his sister are going to try to see it. I decide not to interrupt and let them go.

He said we'll meet again the next morning at 10AM. We exchange contact info [Facebook and e-mail addresses]. He said he will contact me again on his first holiday, which is in 100 days.

I go to sleep. I wake up at night often as 찜질방 [jjimjibangs] are quite uncomfortable due to the white fluorescent lights that are on all night and the high room temperature [or higher than my perception of room temperature]. I saw him sleeping at around 6 and 7 AM. I saw him awake at around 8 or 9 AM. A janitor wakes me up at 9:30AM. He was gone.

The next day I enter a cafe to use wifi. I accept his Facebook friend request. Now I must wait 100 days, as with everyone else he knows.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Game Files</strong>
<a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/pinkies-up.zip">pinkies-up.zip</a>

<strong>Instructions</strong>
NOTE: Works for iOS 6, not sure about 7. I'm updating everything right now!

This project is really old, but it still seems to work for me. It's an Xcode project.
1. unzip
2. Open PinkiesUp.xcodeproj
3. Run
4. Pray
5. Play
  - to play it on multiple devices: run the game on each device to install it, start the game on each device, on one device press host game, on the other devices press join game, press at least 2 buttons on each side to have a minimum of 2v2, press ready on each device, press start on the host device.

To see a play through, see the video below.

<strong>Video</strong>
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqO_Vyc9a1Q">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqO_Vyc9a1Q</a> via <a href="http://jonstoked.com/pinkies-up">http://jonstoked.com/pinkies-up</a>

<strong>Design Statement</strong>
Summary:
As Jon often describes the game to others, “it’s basically flip-cup for iPad”.

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_8911.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-1411 aligncenter" alt="IMG_8911" src="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_8911-1024x557.jpg" width="496" height="270" /></a></p>

Two teams race, each team having a quirky physics based character code-named Harold. Each player is assigned one button. Each active player group must press their buttons in sequence to add force to Harold. A button pressed out of sequence causes Harold to physically collapse, stopping him for a moment. First Harold to the finish line, which is at the end of the screen of the last device, wins.

Intentions:
A social extensible-multiplayer iPad game with a simple interface. It’s what Jon and I had been gravitating toward for the previous few months.

We intended to maximize the use of iPad’s features: eleven touches, physics, and networking. Oh the possibilities! A single parallax scrolling background over multiple devices as Harold runs across the screen, UI color palettes and silly sounds for each device.
Personal Contribution
The game is Jon’s idea, which constitutes a large portion of the game design. We collaborated to etch out further game design. I programmed everything except the physics of Harold. Jon also handled visual design.

Learned:
The greatest problem with development was the lack of consistent playtesting. Consistent playtesting is needed to see progress and priority, but also to maintain motivation. A related problem: we were working remotely. Being physically together is important.

I also underestimated the time it takes to write code for Objective-C, Cocos2d, Box2d, and Game Kit. It was at least five times slower than writing code for my previously used game engine: FlashPunk. I also felt that my networking code was poorly written. It takes time.

The lack of feedback caused motivation to wane, and the work sits on my computer, teasing me. Perhaps I just need to bring it out, playtest it to regain motivation, and finish it.]]></content:encoded>

My gripe about blogs is that I find 99% of them useless, including my own. I've never followed a blog, I've only stumbled upon specific well-written posts by people that I admire. If "how to hold a hamburger properly" was chosen to be "freshly pressed" then I deem Wordpress's standards for content is low, aiming for popularity instead of quality. I don't seek popularity; I only care for those few people who actually searched specifically for something I wrote.

Again, blogging is my lowest priority. Before I can write anything, I have to create/do something first.</blockquote>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[While riding a scooter through Baroda, I had a conversation with my uncle. We debated the differences of people in cities and suburbs.

I said people in the city are more likely to care for everybody, not just their family.

He responded with a story about a time his brother's father-in-law was sick: The father-in-law needed a large amount of blood per day for seven days. A new person for each day was required to give a large amount of blood. The needle they use is large and the machines scared most public volunteers. No one from his family volunteered. My uncle asked some of his friends from the city, and they agreed to help, without knowing his father-in-law.

I pondered if a similar middle to upper class suburbanite suffered a large change in life resulting in her to have little money, would he change? My uncle responded no. The event would be traumatic. A person who went from poor to rich is unable to go backwards, however, if the person was never poor, the person may change.

These people become comfortable, forgetting about other people, become insular, and instead drone on meaningless things. City folk fight for time; Surburbanites find ways to pass it. Values are lost. Their lives are the center. When they are reminded of less fortunate people, do they not spend time thinking about it, responding to it?

They cling to their own kin, unable to melt.

The pro is that they retain culture. Ethnic enclaves in western cities do just that. In New York, Chinatowns, an East Asian area (Flushing), A South Asian area (Jackson Heights), a European area (Greenpoint), a Hassidic Jew (between Williamsburg and Clinton Hill) area all exist in the surburbs. It works out really well. Their kids can choose to melt into the city or stay with their kin.

The con is that they are insular, which becomes clearly apparent when one goes to their origin country in which 99% of all people are of their kind. Common cultural behaviors dominate society affecting daily life. <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/seoul">Seoul is a weird DisneyLand</a>. India is a mess. Conformism becomes stronger. Divergence becomes harder. Creative people desire some place better.

Some people are flexible, some aren't.

<blockquote>"Populations differ in their phenotypic plasticity, which is the ability of an organism with a given genotype to change its phenotype in response to changes in its habitat, or to move to a different habitat.[69][70]

To a greater or lesser extent, all living things can adjust to circumstances. The degree of flexibility is inherited, and varies to some extent between individuals. A highly specialized animal or plant lives only in a well-defined habitat, eats a specific type of food, and cannot survive if its needs are not met. Many herbivores are like this; extreme examples are koalas which depend on eucalyptus, and pandas which require bamboo. A generalist, on the other hand, eats a range of food, and can survive in many different conditions. Examples are humans, rats, crabs and many carnivores. The tendency to behave in a specialized or exploratory manner is inherited – it is an adaptation.

Rather different is developmental flexibility: "An animal or plant is developmentally flexible if when it is raised or transferred to new conditions it develops so that it is better fitted to survive in the new circumstances".[71] Once again, there are huge differences between species, and the capacities to be flexible are inherited."</blockquote>

I'm a flexible person raised in an inflexible environment.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[[TODO: should come back to this one. Personal history and social determinism.]

I'm a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation#Flexibility.2C_acclimatization.2C_learning">flexible</a> person. I adapt to the place I live. Recently, I've stayed in several countries and unconsciously adapted to each one, resulting in extreme observation of a different kind.

In the suburbs I was prone to several faults, wasting a lot of time, letting time pass without thought.

In San Francisco, I was amazed by the amount new things going on compared to the suburbs, especially related to diversity in income and race. I worked hard played hard.

In New York, I allocated every hour into work, leaving social time only for people related to my narrow interests or work. There was no place to relax.

In Taiwan, I became more outgoing and familial. I talked to people in the public, spent time with people I previously wouldn't have, and I valued conversations with individuals.

In Thailand, I was alone, thinking like an introvert, only able to consume because of the language barrier.

In Penang, I was quite social, but fought time to focus on work.

In India, I became extremely social. I valued social time more than anything. I'd spend the entire day with people, unable to do any computer work alone. I sat outside everyday, went out with my uncle often, played games with friends, taking every social opportunity. I also became more minimalist, not buying anything, save food. I also didn't have to go far to be social, so there was no commute times.

In Nepal, I maintained my social outgoing self, consumed the culture around me, but was able to do a little more computer work as I was away from deep social connections.

In Seoul, I became more introvert, mostly because I was unable to find like-minded people to work or go out with, but also because of the language barrier, and living near the bourgeoisie.

I try hard to be myself in every place, but I always adapt to some degree. I keep my space. I have to fight to balance life despite having terrible time management skills.

Knowing that I adapt to my surroundings to some extent, it's important to choose the right place. 

Where's the most optimal place to learn, taking the environment into consideration?

A place with smart peers. That's all that matters. Really.

A smart person in a suburb could be wasting potential. Conversely, smart people should return to their homes to invest in their home country.



This thought occurred when a group of Parisians entered my hostel. About to begin their Master's degree, they know at least four languages -- French, English, some Spanish, and some Korean. They socialize quickly, smoke, and drink as much as Koreans do. They're quick, smart, and get shit done. They remind me of the people from New York, specifically Brooklyn.

Are the top global cities -- New York, London, Paris -- the best place to grow up? I think so.

First, just live. Don't get stuck in indecision.

A smart person learns from any given situation: a two-year conscription in South Korea, laborious rural jobs, whatever. There's something to learn.

Still

The place should be diverse in income, race, and intelligence.


also write about how I adapt to all environments: more social in India, more introvert in Seoul, more hard-working in New York, prone to laziness in suburbs.

also write about how some people value people so much so that they stay at home, become and inspiration to the people around them

also write about maintaining social and environmental values, socializing with all classes of people, all ages, all countries, not wasting money, cooking instead of eating out, working in parks and hostels instead of cafes]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This post was written after drinking quite a bit of so-ja (soju and cider [lemon-lime soda]).

I normally constantly evaluate time, but I wonder, how does one justify it?

Time.

One could spend a lifetime in a single place, thinking about doing something and never doing it. One could spend a lifetime with family. One could spend a lifetime with strangers. One could spend a lifetime learning and never doing. One could spend a lifetime doing and never learning.

One has to balance time. Some time with family, some with friends, some with others, some on work, some on the needy, some thinking, some exploring.

My greatest struggle is balancing time. [blog link to another post]

How does one justify time?

Braid took three and a half years to make. Babycastles can throw an event together in a few days. Which has a larger impact? The impact is the same. Braid effects more people because it is instilled on a distributable medium. Performances only effect the people nearby. If I weren't in New York, I wouldn't know about Babycastles. That would have been a shame.

Values change over time.

When I was in the U.S. I justified time for fine art. When I was traveling, I justified time for travel and meeting people. When I was India, I valued my time with family and neighbors. When I was in Hong Kong and Seoul, I justified time with like-minded people.

How can one evaluate time in their life? What's the most efficient method. What is most balanced?

Life has to be balanced to output great work efficiently. One needs to be social to measure time, yet working to complete a project, and taking care of their family and friends.

While traveling Hong Kong and Seoul, I didn't feel like working on a an old game which requires hours of programming on of several hours from several people. It didn't make sense. I could directly effect someone with a public performance that takes less time to create and has the same impact, or even more simply, by talking to them. Why go through the mess of making a game for a medium when one can use new media and public art to effect people directly. I feel that I made some effect to the people I talked to. No work necessary. Just conversation.

When I think about the less fortunate, I think about what I can do. NGO effect people directly, but again, it's a small audience. Protests and other small statements have little to no effect. Large moves are necessary. What difference can an individual make? Most diplomats enter a system. How did Ghandi and MLK do it? It was just talking. Through letters to powerful individuals or speech. It's always conversation.

Talking to people is valuable.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[[Old draft, posting anyway. Not a bad start!]

Confidence swings from a Ai Wei Wei to a suburbanite in the same day. Lack of personal image in the perspectives of others blocks the gauging of relationships. If I have work, I don't care. It's only when I stop working, when I start to think of it. Then, I pick my shit up and continue.

from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_mind#Deficits">the deficits of Theory of Mind</a>:

<blockquote>The theory of mind (ToM) impairment describes a difficulty someone would have with perspective taking. This is also sometimes referred to as mind-blindness. This means that individuals with a ToM impairment would have a hard time seeing things from any other perspective than their own.[37] Individuals who experience a theory of mind deficit have difficulty determining the intentions of others, lack understanding of how their behavior affects others, and have a difficult time with social reciprocity.[38] ToM deficits have been observed in people with autism spectrum disorders, people with schizophrenia, people with attention deficit disorder,[2] persons under the influence of alcohol and narcotics, sleep-deprived persons, and persons who are experiencing severe emotional or physical pain.</blockquote>

		<title>The Life of a Nomadic Schizoid</title>
		<link>http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/the-life-of-a-nomadic-schizoid</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I enter a new place. It begins with excitement. There are areas to explore, people to meet, things to do. I wake up spontaneously. I think about what to do that day, and I do it. I'm consuming, exploring, constantly creating new direction, thinking every moment. Along with consumption comes creativity. I create new work, new projects, and inspire others to do the same. Time goes slow. I think by the minute. I'm extroverted. Life is balanced -- time with friends, strangers, and very little personal work. I value social time.

At some point, the direction is lost. I lingered for too long. The motivation disappears. I fail to maintain the consumption and creation. Depression replaces the void. Introversion and indifference take over. The world becomes uninteresting. I want to recover as fast as possible, but it's difficult to pinpoint what went wrong and how to fix it. Time flies because I have no social life to gauge it, or, I have a social life, but am conforming to others, and am unable to maintain my own direction with it.

What happened? Why did I stop?

My value in social time with others dissipates. I push people away because I need to go in my own direction, but doing so, I lose the social excitement. I still haven't learned how to maintain the excitement. I haven't learned how to maintain a relationship.

After cutting off my social connections, the rest of the world keeps me alive. Human struggle. The lives of those less fortunate: the bums on the streets, the families in the slums of Kathmandu, and the uneducated kids in India. Struggle depicted in films. Films are more powerful to introverts and especially schizoids because they depict a life without interacting with it. It's enough to keep me working, but creativity is gone.

What's the solution?

I thought a more social job, especially one that interacts with kids and family would cure it. Something meaningful to me. I volunteered at a school, but it was too much. I couldn't think correctly. Although I loved it, I ended up pushing away from it to make time for myself.

Perhaps I just need to take on as many projects as possible. Work is a schizoid's best friend. Learn to manage time and squeeze in personal time between the projects. Perhaps I need a family force myself to care. Perhaps I simply need to reach out.

For now, I just keep moving on. The cycle repeats.

'Tis the life of a nomadic schizoid.

--
I <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Schizoid/comments/1ru414/travel/">posted on reddit</a> about this.

The post:
I want to know some schizoid travel experiences.

I have extremely intense feelings, observing everything, loving life, being social, exploring with others, meeting new people, slowing consuming it all, until I inevitably become bored again.
In the beginning I'm extremely observant. I spend nearly all of my time in the public. My mind is exploding. I want to explore everything around me - culture, people, and nature. Empiricism. I wonder why anyone would spend any time on the computer, or work, or spend time inside of a house. I have fine art ideas on the level of Banksy, but wouldn't want to execute the ideas alone, and there's probably no one that thinks similarly. I don't care for media (film, music, non-social games), only the interaction of people. I'm also extremely social. I don't do anything without people. There are other travelers to meet and explore with. I love the public, as I'm deeply curious about people, in a Humans of New York sort of way. Programming with my headphones at night feels like a chore and waste of life. I make decisions quick.

After some time, the intense feelings of novelty fade, the external stimuli is lowered, the initial motivation that woke me up early morning is gone, and I rely on the social connections I created, tending those relationships, attending social events. Still, I fight to be social.
After some more time, my narrow interests change from travel to more specific things and I begin to flake out on social events as I value them less. I run into the indecision problem. I'm doomed until I create a new direction, after which the cycle restarts.

It seems it would be more fun to travel to a new place, find another job, work for a few months, then to live in one place. At least, for the moment. Life becomes an adventure.

How about you?

Are there any other nomads? Programming and backpacking? Lived in several cities?]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Learning Languages is Difficult for Narrow-minded People</title>
		<link>http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/learning-languages-is-difficult-for-narrow-minded-people</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I'm narrow-minded. I often go in a single direction, ignoring everything else, or anything I don't value. It's terrible. It's probably why I stopped being so narrow and started traveling.

People who conspicuously consume have an advantage over me. They soak in language.

I've met a lot of travelers who can speak several languages. Most of them learned a significant amount by watching TV shows.

I don't watch TV shows because I don't value my time watching them. Of course, now that I want to learn a specific language I'll do it. Still, it sucks.

TV teaches everything one needs about language except physical practice, the act of responding. Asian people take English class for several years, memorize a lot of vocabulary and grammar, but are still unable to hold a conversation in English.

The best way to learn a language is to live in a country where they speak and place yourself in a social place everyday -- a job that forces you to talk. Or, just regularly use a language exchange service to find someone to Skype with over the internet.

Another problem is that I'm indifferent to social norms and conventions, including idle conversation. I don't say "Hello, how are you doing" to everyone. I'm concise, down to business. So even when I am in a new country, unless I'm traveling and being my extroverted happy self, I don't really care to talk so much.

For these reasons, language is not naturally learned for me. I have to artificially learn by forcing myself to watch terrible TV shows and have valueless conversations with people, or, somehow create a meaningful experience that involves me talking to people.

Poopie.

		<title>Social Norms and Asia</title>
		<link>http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/social-norms-and-asia</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[While travelling in hostels in Asia, a popular topic among travelers are social norms.

How Asians care for the safety, education, and future of their children. How Korean and Japanese people work long hours, feel that they worked hard, and deserve drinking the weeknight away. How Koreans spend time over meals, eating and talking. How it's illegal to talk on a cell phone in a subway in Japan. How Taiwanese people care for everything -- their country's image, friends, family, foreigners -- or, how they take a single incident and use it to create a macro image of something.

Well, maybe that's more stereotyping.

Anyway, in homogeneous countries, social norms are more powerful than in diverse ones. A largeer percent of people hold the same beliefs and conform to existing norms. To be different one has to ignore more of their surroundings and maintain a deviant group.

I've talked to some smart people. Perhaps not the smartest or most confident, but smart enough to deviate from the norms they were raised in and to choose their own path. All of them want to do the same thing: immigrate to a more diverse country, any westernized country -- Australia, New Zealand, Scandinavia, USA. They feel that they are unable to develop in their own country and feel it may be easier in a westernized country.

I've always questioned this. Is it easier to grow up and develop in the US than in Japan? Both are developed countries. Do social norms play such a great role? If one can't be different in their own country, what makes them feel they can do better in another? Is it easier to be different in a westernized country? Is this the con of culture?

I understand there are several reasons for people to immigrate from less developed countries, but is solely the influence of social norms of homogeneous developed countries enough of a reason? My personal view of the nature versus nurture debate, in general, is so: there is a bottom line in which environment matters, the lack of access to money, education, free time, etc., but once an individual has that, especially at an early age, their potential is based on genetics. Japan and Korea have these necessary things. Are the social norms so strong as to stop people from developing further? Why aren't Japanese and Korean people pushing out Nobel Prizes? Well, maybe Korea and Taiwan are still young in terms of development, and even the Meiji restoration was only a hundred years ago.

The said smart people felt so. So much as to say that they don't want their own kids to grow up in their country, which is one of the greatest reasons people immigrate.

I don't know because I haven't grown up in one, unless the suburbs count. Actually, my transition from a suburb to city has similar reasons!

Anyway, it's just a thought revived while talking to a French guy about social norms we observed in Asian countries, which then sparked my recent experiences with Koreans I befriended and whom I had emotional conversations with.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Life and Work 2</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Another thought quickly jotted down after leaving early from a social outing.

Life and work. Living and working. It's something I feel I've been striving for my entire life.

I feel that the related term, work-life balance, suggests that they are separate entities.

<blockquote>Work–life balance is a concept including proper prioritizing between "work" (career and ambition) and "lifestyle" (health, pleasure, leisure, family and spiritual development/meditation).</blockquote>

But I disagree. They shouldn't be treated as so.

<blockquote>"Paul Krassner remarked that anthropologists, use a definition of happiness that is to have as little separation as possible "between your work and your play."</blockquote>

Some people can go to an office, work, then enjoy life after work, never thinking about work. The times are separated in their schedules. This leads to a work hard play hard lifestyle. I never fit it. I'm constantly trying to fit work in life. I have no set hours or routine. I just live. Maybe I work 12 hours a day working a game I'm motivated to create or 10 hours volunteering at a school, or maybe I work 3 hours a day, spending most of the time on relationships. Life doesn't have a schedule.

After telling a friend that I felt that I've lived for several years while travelling, she responded, "You feel it was long because you experienced so much." It's true. You have to constantly experience new things. You have to keep living, even while working.

If the work doesn't provide enough new experiences, then you're likely going to quit. You have to  create new experiences at the workplace. Be social and creative, yet work hard, simultaneously.

I found it quite difficult to have new social experiences in a specific type of work: developing software on a computer. In computer programming, you are facing a computer. You're sight is focused on an operating system. You rely on audio for new experience, especially when inside a building. When I was programming, I spent most of the time in public places: in libraries, outside, in a cafe, on a train, in a hostel, places after meeting someone or attending an event. These tend to be the best workplaces because they have the most amount of life. Still, it wasn't enough. I wasn't experiencing enough life. I filled the void with films, consuming as fast as possible between work. It was much better than an office, but still not enough. There wasn't enough face-to-face social time. I failed to balance work-life.

I imagine it's best to have a backup workplace where there will always be friends or family there. Home with the kids, a co-working studio. Then one can work from anywhere, mixing life and work freely, but having a guaranteed place to come back to, so one doesn't have to hunt for cafes at night or on rainy days, and one doesn't have to be alone.

It's ironic that computers, technology, a thing that made communication easy, lead to a poor social life.

I always juggle my two ambitions: game and film. I like games as an emerging art medium, but I feel the process of making games, programming, makes maintaining a good social life difficult, especially compared to the process of making films.

Or, more likely the case, I suck at balancing life and work.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[[Old draft. Did not read. Looks like interesting personal history / thought.]

When I arrived in Taipei I was excited, to travel, to create, to learn Chinese, to socialize. It started with the normal intense feelings of travel where I'd consume everything and think at incredible speeds to continually have new experiences; Life is an adventure. I especially consumed Chinese as it was one of my goals, furthering my social life. I was extremely happy and extremely social. I'd go out with hostelmates, schoolmates, meet artists, and even talk to people on the street (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/TaiwanesePeople">Humans of Taiwan)</a>. I had several ideas I was excited to share and begin.

It worked well, for about two weeks. I felt a slow decline. I forced myself to continue. First, Humans of New York stopped, I was unable to talk to strangers again. Many weeks later, I don't care to talk to strangers. I don't care to talk to anyone really, anymore.

"Do I want to be a normal member of society, or should I be my hermit self, ignoring the world?"

"I ignored everyone in Hampton Roads, why should I spend time with people in Taipei? Unless it's a small town feel."

"Focus on art: film studio, humans, Vincent moon, etc. Stop going out for social situations. Explore instead."

"Be social to keep speed to life."

10/5
Transforming into my former hard-working self. Need to relax, stay outside, be social, work at a cafe or school, freelance art and programming.

No! Don't be so anti-social. Talk to people on a daily basis. It's how you keep track of time.

Get a scooter. Buses are a waste of time.

Teach at a nearby school, work at a nearby cafe, be social, stay outside, be creative as you were while traveling.

Be quick like the guy from Toronto.


10/6
Yesterday and Today, I feel great, relaxed. A direction was chosen. The problem of last week was indecision.

I still feel extremely restless every morning, but learning languages, talking to people, walking outside, eases it.

I can't wait to find an apartment, get a scooter, make things. Still, I have to be careful of time. The other classmates have already found an apartment!

Today I felt on top of the world. No deadline. Nothing needed to be done. No stress. Worry free life. Is that what I need for art? Is that why India did not work? Was it too emotional for me? Consuming without creating?

Fuck. Wasted more time. Need to control myself. 8 hour workdays, including cafe and tutor

I need to control my time. That's my greatest problem. Follow the plan.bless wanderlust.

10/7
Take time to sleep, think creatively, then make a move. But make decisions quick! Keep living.

Learning a language requires routine. There's no way around it.

I have no idea of what life is. Should I care for the less fortunate? Innovate? Live happily in a third world country? It seems all I can do is live. Spend less time in indecision and do as much as I can, while still taking the time to design and plan.

Nap anywhere anytime. But try to stay up during the day, to do work with people.

Schedule yourself

Don't worry about money. Freelance programming! Focus time on learning, work, and travel.

Plan less, do more? Need more projects! Need more life!

我不喜歡commuting in Taipei, or, I'm being indecisive again, as usual. I need to calm down, stay in my neighborhood, make stuff. Work more, walk less.

I'm missing out on so much life.

Create stickies of humans, Vincent moon, edward yang, babycastles, languages, and calavino at home and at my workplace.

Power generator, food cart, projector.

Keep exploring, keep taking on new projects, keep talking to people, keep enjoying life.

10/8
Consuming the things around me as opposed to something specific. Have to learn when to consume around and specific. Time self.

10/9
I didn't do much today. My brain was slow. Social life stopped after 6pm. I slept in an air conditioned library and computered a little. I accomplished nothing. Caffeine withdrawal? At least when I have caffiene, I'm fighting for life, doing something. Without it, I have no social energy or interest.

I need to maintain one of he following to stay active: social life and excitement, caffiene, or exercise.

There was so much time in a day. What the fuck happened to it today? I need to consume more of the world around me. I was ignoring too much. If I ignore the world, I can always watch a film, but I failed to do that. I just went through the day, meaningless.

After taking a nap, one should do something social.

Difficult to live and create simultaneously. Study hard at night. All phrases, vocab, writing, listening.

I'm waking up without reason, creativity. I really miss that. I'm unable to balance life and work. It distracts me from my personal direction. My motivation.

Learning a language without a motivation is really difficult. I need reason to talk to people, not just for the sake of practicing.

Dont let anyone take you in the wrong direction. You don't have to spend time learning chinese with classmates if it doesn't motivate you. Learn it in your own way. It's more fun, more serious, much more interesting, in my view. See the beauty in the world.

Being with people, I lose interest in people, and I lose creativity.

Remember, you don't have to do anything. It's up to you. It's okay to sleep, explore, in fact, it's necessary.

I should be social about things I love. That's why babycastles worked. They were people with similar interests. I need to hang with people with similar interests, or, completely foreign people that no one knows.

Use 30 minutes of memrise in the morning and evening for each language. Watch some TV. No, that's unsocial. Spend time with people. Get a professional or social job. Fuck the library.

Never overwork yourself.



...

school, very social

Half way through the class I made the decision that, although I failed to do what I set out to do -- join or create a new media company -- I would finish the Chinese class. Feeling that my classmates would do better by going to class and studying after school, I started to go back to class, and hang out with my classmates. Besides, they were my closest friends. My Taiwanese friends all have jobs.

I was social. I'd go to class. Hang out with the classmates after school, and often at night. Sometimes after class I'd go to the Language Corner, which is something a few people at school started to help people learn Chinese. I started going there because I realized I didn't feel like talking to strangers, so I started talking to them.

With the class, after-class activity, and hanging out with the people at my hostel, my day was booked. I'd be social until I needed to sleep. I'd drink with hostel mates at the hostel, or a nearby bar. I didn't mind spending time with people. In fact, I want to.

I made sure whatever I did was interactive. I doing things with people. That's all that mattered. I felt that if I weren't doing something with someone, then it was meaningless, as if the moment in time wouldn't exist.

...

I moved to an apartment. This made me quite lonely.

Near the end of class I basically gave up on Chinese. I started using English, thinking in English, not caring for the class. The intrinsic motivation was completely gone. I wasn't traveling, I didn't want to talk, so why learn Chinese? It didn't make sense. I need the urge to talk to Chinese-only speaking people to learn Chinese. This is why I don't like school. But this is also my failure, as I was unable to retain motivation for three months, barely one.

I wasn't fighting for time. I wasn't maximizing my time in a country that I would never be in again. I didn't have a project I was striving for. I wasn't fighting to make every hour of my life count. I started to become lazy. Forgetting that I am in debt. I needed some kind of reality check, but it never came. I just decided to give up until class ended. After that, I'd have to do something. I'd have to get a job.

...

after school, alone

Was I social for the sake of learning a language? For the sake of traveling? So I don't forget about other people? The Humans project? A normal social life?

Half way through class I felt I consumed all I could from Taipei. I've seen everything. Nothing excited me. So, I stuck to my classmates. I followed them. Zero creativity. I just followed. It was fun, socially normal. The problem was whenever I was alone, I had trouble be social with other people. I just wasn't interested in the rest of the world anymore. I tried movies, but movies were still too far from life. It was a tough time. I didn't feel like doing anything at times. I'd just "study" Chinese. I didn't care for the Humans project. I didn't care for making games. I didn't care for art. A depression, for sure.

After the class ended, I stopped waking up on time. I lost circadian rhythm immediately. I lost social life. I didn't contact anyone. I failed to use technology to maintain a social life. I failed to be creative. I failed to be social enough to new people.

A few depressing days followed in which I'd wake up late, not be social, not want to create my own direction, overeat, oversleep, plan a lot, but do nothing in reality. Everything is in my head. No actions are taken. Just thoughts. Over-thinking, over-planning, over-researching, indecision. Failing to "just do it". Social interaction is how I track time. Without people's feedback, I'm unable to see progress. I need people. I did absolutely nothing, or, I was radically changing, again.

I started to create my own path. More things to do. More in my own direction. I was okay with being alone. I could think quite clearly. I exercised. I still slept whenever I wanted, but I felt good. My former self. On top of the world in a different way. My own way. I didn't consume anything. I did what I wanted.

Which life is better? A social conformist one or a loner creative? Why am I unable to balance the two? All I need to do is spend a few hours being social, and a few hours being myself, yet I fail and fall into extremes. As always. I'm too obsessive.

The solution? Have someone to schedule my life everyday. Or, create a timer and follow it. Somehow.

Or continue to be social during the day and do my personal work at night, when everyone is asleep.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Journey to Yarsa is a simple documentary that bares little difference from a traveller's video. It follows a family in Nepal to pick Yarsagumba, a prized fungus.

Perhaps the viewing experience was affected by my current meh mood, but I felt no emotions toward the film. It was a weird experience. Clearly there was some struggle going on. Maybe it was the happiness of Nepalese people, and my real experience with them that voided the film of any feeling of struggle.

Or, more likely the case, it was the constant voice over dialogue that took my attention away from the video, not allowing me to think, to observe, to create thoughts myself. I always lose attention whenever a documentary because it doesn't ask the audience to think. I don't need people talking in front of the screen.

The previous film I had watched, Certified Copy, was enthralling to me the entire length. It also was straightforward with constant dialogue (by the characters), but there was somehow a lot more to observe. I find it odd that I always find narratives far more interesting than documentaries. Documentaries are real. Perhaps because film is not real (I'm not physically interacting with it), it doesn't affect my pathos. Perhaps it's the control of emotions of narratives. The power of the art itself. That's what affects me. This film is lacking it.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[After feeling a bit woozy watching great modern films by Asian directors Kim Ki Duk, Tsai Ming Liang, and Hou Xiao Xian, I was quite glad to watch Copie conforme (Certified Copy). A film with a normal thrill curve. A guilty pleasure. Perhaps the best of it's kind.

The film is flawless. Like the director's last film A Separation (edit: This is wrong. That film turns out to be by Asghar Farhadi, another amazing Iranian director. The films are so similar! I assumed.), it focuses on a relationship in a single day. Again, very screenplay-heavy, the camera keeping the couple in the shot, shot naturally requiring less cinematography and more acting. The film plays like a ride with seemingly extremely few cuts; It's straightforward. It feels as if there's nothing to analyze.

But I'll try, a little.

The screenplay requires the actors to be top-notch to endure long takes, maintain realism, and especially to keep the film entirely ambiguous.

The film feels quite universal, containing very familiar characters and events. I consider myself schizoid with characteristics very close to the male: I'm cold, use rationality over emotions, and have narrow interests.  Not all males are as cold as me or the male in the film, but I bet many people can identify with many of either one of the character's characteristics. Moreover, I bet people know someone very much like the two characters shown.

Certainly there are some slightly unbelievable things such as the symbolism of art in the film and the strangers met giving advice, one to the male, one to the female, making the screenplay perfect for what occurs in a single day, just as A Separation did. However, it didn't bother me. I was enthralled.

I only wish Karaistami continues to show me a day in the life of a relationship, or any person.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>A Critical Analysis of Super Smash Bros. Melee</title>
		<link>http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/a-critical-analysis-of-super-smash-bros-melee</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Written for NYU Game Design MFA application.

<strong>Preface</strong>
It seems that I chose this game because of my love for it rather than a game whose critical analysis could lead to a new direction for the future of games. Nostalgia and subjectivity exist. Also, this analysis only focuses on versus mode with tournament settings.

<strong>Body</strong>
In my college there was a public room with three TVs, all of which solely had Super Smash Bros. Melee (SSBM). My friends and I used to watch videos of professionals play, be inspired, incorporate their skills into our tactics, then participate in regional tournaments, cheering local players. Clear now, but only in hindsight I realize it was a sport.

What makes this game stand above other fighting games of its time is its accessibility. That’s Nintendo’s strength. It had simple controls, no button combinations to memorize, a short learning curve, and an eccentric, lovable selection of characters. This attracted diverse players whom later formed a similarly eccentric, lovable community.
 
Despite its accessibility it has a complex, successful fighting system -- the more skilled player always win. There are several mechanics (rules) to the game leading to an infinite amount of possibility and therefore knowledge. Players explore the possibilities because they are motivated to win, incorporating newly found knowledge into their tactics. It’s a creative process. After 12 years people are still finding new possibilities; It’s existence at EVO 2013 exemplifies is longevity.

However, complexity doesn’t necessarily prolong the life of the game, as proven by ancient games such as chess, but in this case it does help maintain excitement for a cartridge game, just as new content (maps) and core updates do for other competitive games. Perhaps there is even some satisfaction in learning a complex system. Many Asian gamers tend to play knowledge heavy, calculating games. It’s unnecessary, resulting in a higher competitive play learning curve, yet, requiring more skill.

Another pro, especially compared to sports, is that SSBM has nearly no down time. As long as the match is running, there is likely something to do to gain advantage.

A possible con of SSBM is that its complexity flows over to the input. Professional players need quick hands and great hand-eye coordination, practicing certain hand movements to execute advanced moves. I believe it’s sequel (SSBB) attempted to alleviate this by limiting the input, but it resulted in a less exciting game, especially to watch. Decisions need to be timed to generate excitement, but limiting input limits decisions, which limits possibilities.

In my life, no other game or sport has created more exciting moments than matches of SSBM. And, just as any other sport, it is repayable, timeless.

In 2011, indie game designers began creating accessible yet complex sports games. Will Hokra with its simplicity generate enough excitement to be taken seriously as ultimate flying disc did? Regardless of its outcome, I believe Super Smash Bros. Melee is a prominent precursor.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>A Personal Statement for Game Design</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Written for a certain Game Design application.

<strong>Preface</strong>
The Internet service man is currently haphazardly pulling cable to my parent’s house in India in a way to avoid monkeys from snagging it. Pardon the superficial errors.

<strong>Why I am interested</strong>
Games are special to me because it is one form of social interaction that my personality consistently agrees to partake in, a social event that I feel creates a new experience every play, an alternative to socially normal events, which often fail to entice me.

I self-diagnosed myself to have schizoid personality disorder (SPD). I often withdraw from social situations, have narrow focus, have trouble maintaining relationships, and am indifferent to social norms, yet, I often have strong a desire to interact with people. Nearly all of my close friends in my life were initially contacted through games. Games enabled me to be social in a way that doesn't make me anxious, and is something I actually enjoy. It wasn't until much later in life while living and travelling in new cities and the world that I began to interact in somewhat more socially normal ways. Without games I probably would be a hermit, a McCandless [Into the Wild]. Sounds like a lame teenage wallflower story, but I believe there's some rational, psychological reasoning behind the interactions between schizoids and games. My life is constantly experimenting and suffering from this.

Despite my love for several arts, I think the interaction between people have a greater affect on people than the interaction between person(s) and an inanimate medium.  It’s simple: moments are more memorable when shared.

Lastly, there's just more to explore in games, interaction, urban spaces, new media, and that’s excluding its endless applications.

<strong>Personal vision, impact on the field, speculation of thesis</strong>
My life’s objective is this: I want to make people always feel that the world is a playground, that there's always the option to stay out, to physically explore, play, socialize, collaborate, with friends, family, and strangers of all classes of society alike, maximizing physical social time, therefore maximizing memories.

When I travel I often have extreme, schizoid-affected feelings from external stimuli. I become extremely playful and overly confident, like a child. I want to explore everything, do everything, and talk to everyone. Empiricism; Learning through play. I often felt that I was the only one interacting with the people around me -- in a subway in Seoul, in craftsman shops in Malaysia, on the streets of Taipei -- while they were on their smartphones (probably maintaining relationships). I was outside all day everyday. I despised being indoors, hence my choice in Taipei, a very street-life oriented culture. I wondered why people didn't feel the same way. What people were thinking, if they were thinking, during their routines. I felt over time people, including me, narrow their life to their work, friends, and family, forgetting the world of possibilities. During this time, I saw gaps in society where people are so in routine that fail to maximize their life’s time -- on public transportation, lone jobs (small shops, night shifts), and in developed cities without street life (Japan, Western world).

Games can fit these gaps. Public games. Played with the people around. Something anyone can stumble over in a city: in the park, on the subway, inside, and outside. Games should be a part of everyday life. Turn that lonely down time to social game time. Relieve oneself through gameplay, prevent the social barrier from forming, talk to people, and maintain playfulness. Playfulness begets confidence.

A speculation: games in New York public transportation systems to encourage meaningful interaction between strangers via inquiry, without an electronic device.

I prefer public art (and games) to an easily distributable medium because it affects anyone nearby. The audience isn't narrow. Even if the art is infused on a medium, it should be placed in public a la Babycastle’s public arcades.

In the 1980’s Fluxus wrote "Learning through conversation, inquiring, group play, and games serves as the most effective educational model for the future generation who will live in the information society.” In the same vain I believe that even games without a specific purpose such as learning or research will return positive results because one is interacting with new people. Simply putting a diverse group of people in the same space to interact can lead to powerful outcomes. A good social event is an interactive one.

Another speculation: Big games that have a specific positive affect to the environment: to clean trash, generate power, help the needy, teach, log and map data, etc. If people cannot do something creative, at least they can do something productive.

<strong>Why select focus, what I can contribute to a team, and what makes me a strong candidate</strong>
On a team I can contribute to game design and implementation (including programming). I'm a DIY problem-solver type that narrowly focuses on interaction and gameplay, so much so that I feel technology gets in the way. Naturally game design will be my focus, but I’m really interested in specific ITP courses to gain more knowledge and possibility.

I believe my strength (and weakness) is retaining the idealistic, child-like vision of play, and my desire for universalism. I’ve lost care for digital games because of my time in Asia.

The main reason I want to go to school is because I no longer want to create games alone; Game development should be interactive. Also, I have great peers in New York.

Perhaps the underlying grandiose reason of why I want to enter game design is so that I myself can maintain those child-like feelings. To live, learn, and play, simultaneously; To avoid narrowing my focus to work, getting bored, withdrawing, changing direction, moving, again, as I've always done.

<strong>Epilogue</strong>
After writing this, I noticed there’s a lot of feelings and a lack of direction, more fitting for ITP, yet I feel that there is a clear love for games itself, particularly its replayability.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I watched this during a depression, which turns out to be a very good time for watching movies, as I can easily focus on it. I watched it because the Wikipedia page of Edward Yang claims it rekindled his passion for film. He probably saw it in the late 70s.

Immediately, I was engrossed. The valleyside of mountains of Peru (or so it is told), people marching steeply down clouds, the contrast of spanish soldiers dressed for dinner and raw tribal people, a lack of reason why everything is spoken in German, modern music (timeless, even for 2014) that set the feel of a modern, non-sensical, anxiety-ridden epic.

I just watch in wonder, allowing the pagan theme to meander along with the river. The plot and decisions made by characters are nonsensical. It's the feeling provoked by the realism of the setting: a forest which reminds me of my time flowing down the Mekong in Laos, The Deer Hunter, and obviously Apocalypse Now; tribal people and local animals are shown often. Also the stark realism of decisions that may have occurred in the past due to the lack of intelligence: placing the black man in front during battle because Indians might be scared of him, and later using similar reasoning to keep the horse, which when finally abandoned eerily stares back at the camera with a blue and white mask.

Action is rarely shown, and when it is, it's quick, without drama. People die, but it doesn't matter, nothing matters in this world. There's just a feel of constant impending doom, like a shitty H.P. Lovecraft book.

There's this random colorful crew of Spanish soldiers with two princesses, a monk, a silly man made emperor, a black man, a tribal man, a tribal prince all on a raft on a river in the netherworld, and the only thing the characters (and the viewer) can do is watch Aguirre advance them further into their doom.

Although nothing matters in the film, the film is somehow entirely enthralling.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I found the film from a stand in India. I bought it for a few rupees, along with a bunch of old Indian music. The cheap paper cover indicated that it was the TV series, with an episode listing on the back. I continued watching, unsure of whether it was a TV series or film, learning the truth half way.

Watching Cidade dos Homens (City of Men), which is based off of the TV series, which itself is a spin-of of Cidade de Deus (City of God), which I really liked when I saw it in high school, felt like a prolonged TV episode, as many TV show turned films do.

Perhaps I've been really high on life and barely appreciating even high art because I was not engaged in the film at all. It has a gritty setting: gangs, guns, local people 'n all, but the dramedy elements just consistently destroyed the realism. In one instance, One of the main characters has sex on duty, and it trades scenes with his friend also having sex, funky brazilian music plays, it segues on to the next scene; It felt like a sitcom. It's light-hearted. Yet, people have guns, people die, and I can't feel for them because these elements distract me from the events that occur.

I thought about something Tsai Ming-Liang said: Films are not real. People shouldn't have to get so engaged with a film. It's only a screen. It's weird that people go festivals, then go into theater rooms, just to watch something on the screen.

In another thought, I felt that there was a truth in feeling of the film. People in Rio de Janerio do have guns, yet people have to live on, and joy is part of life. During my second time in India, I'd walk down the street, past slums, still thinking about people suffering, but a bit less than the first time, focusing on something insignificant, like purchasing a bottle of Thums Up (an Indian brand of cola). People adapt. It's only crazy from a foreigner's point of view.

I started fast forwarding half way through; I can't withstand TV shows. I'd watch the first few second of a scene and understand the rest, and continue watching with this method. At some points I'd peer into the setting, the favelas, wishing I could walk the streets, talk to people, and really understand life there. I felt that there was so much film in the setting that could have been made with just a few of the people. Closer to the people. With less dialog, less narrative. Maybe I just want to physically be there and not watch a film.

The film ended rather quick at an hour and a half, as much of it was fast forwarded. Maybe I've become an asshole critic who is unable to enjoy action films. Still, it's only an action film.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I watched Vive L'Amour (愛情萬歲; Live Love) at a coincidental time. Just a few weeks ago, I was extremely social. I had class, friends within the locality, always eating with people, not spending more than an hour without talking to someone. Now, I'm in a large house, staying up late to take on personal endeavors, with no social life. The sudden change in social life caused bed-ridden depression instantly, but I eventually adapted to live alone, again.

In Vive L'Amour, there are only three characters. Nothing else. We just watch them, without distractions -- sound and dialog. It feels as if so much time is going by in their lives without doing anything. Sometimes I felt as if I'm not doing anything. Yet, it is enthralling to watch, think, and feel. Although, admittedly, I took breaks to handle the extremely slow pace, I never fast forwarded.

The setting is naturalistic. One character sells coffins, another illegally sells clothes, and the last is a real estate agent. The rest of the world feels bleak. The bland side of Taiwan: ugly condos and cars. It's how I feel whenever I think about the Xinyi district in Taipei.

The actions characters take are novel [to me], adding to realism. bowling a watermelon, stealing keys to an apartment and then sleeping in it. Other scenes are relatable. The younger male character (acted by Lee Kang Sheng) takes actions not uncommon during puberty: masturbating and wearing girl's clothes.

The dramatic tension caused by the characters being close, yet anonymous, is great to experience. The climax is unbreathably tense and thrilling. The final scene ends it well, with a long shot of an desolate park, then the female character quietly uncontrollably cries, finally physically displaying the real emotion beneath all of the characters: extreme loneliness.

I felt that Tsai Ming-Liang [the director] figured out what worked in Rebels of the Neon God, and stripped everything else, which wasn't much, out. The audience now focuses only on the action, often of just one character. It's rather surprising to think how great a minimal film can be, and how few resources is required to make one. It's a success.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[2014
Taiwan, then New York?
The year I go back to work. Will I be able to balance work and life, America and Asia? Work on the streets, sleep on the streets. Vive l'amour.

December 2013
India
Break time.

September 2013 - November 2013
Study in Taiwan
Back to my travel's first love. Learn Chinese. 加油！

July 2013 - September 2013
Travel East Asia
I quickly went through Hong Kong, South Korea, and Japan to determine which is the best place to live and work. I spent around two weeks in Hong Kong and Japan, and the rest of the time in Seoul because I was working on Crystal Brawl. I still travelled, but developed East Asia is not nearly as social and fun as undeveloped South Asia. I talked to or tried talking to people from contemporary art institutions and universities, checking out the art scene from a public perspective, trying to push myself in to no avail. Despite their advances in development, I decided Taiwan is best.

June - July 2013
Living in India
Less work, more life.

May - June 2013
Travel in Nepal and northeast India
I escaped the heat of Gujarat, India and went to Nepal and northeast India with a childhood friend. I spent some more time living in small towns enjoying the relaxed nature of people of mountainous regions whilst making games when everyone slept.

February - April 2013
Living in India
The idea was to be a hermit independent game developer in India, rent-free and worry-free. The idea failed for several reasons realized afterwards. I cannot work alone; I must work with local people. Working alone leads to an unhealthy daily life, especially working on computers. It just didn't make sense. I need to have a community of people to live and work regularly.

A friend from New York came for a month. We were slated to make a game, but we both came to the conclusion that making a game in India did not make sense and instead created a game development workshop and game jam at a nearby university.

August 2011 – February 2012
Travel in Taiwan and Indochina
An unhealthy amount of overconsumption in sights, food, and life. After volunteering at the school in Taiwan, I travelled around the island that is Taiwan (some via CouchSurfing), made a short film in Malaysia (see Roti Delivery), and pondered in Bangkok, deciding to give up work and do some proper traveling. I left my crap at a hostel and made a short motorcycle trip in northwest Thailand. Wanting to further distance myself from development, I seeked indigenous people in Laos, staying in their villages.

An overall psychologically menacing trip for a introverted personality who enjoys late night brainy work and despises conspicuous consumption. I constantly struggled to find value for my time. The language barrier of Southeast Asia undeniably blocked my desire to closely connect with lower class people on many occasions. But as usual, I don't regret it.

August - September 2012
Volunteer at 達達美語補習班 (Dada School) in 中壢 (ZhongLi), 台湾 (Taiwan)
This was my first gig during travel. One of the things I wanted to do while traveling was to try things that I value more than private sector work, in this case, teaching. Perhaps it's why I avoided to take a job at a psychologically abusive social game startup and instead chose to travel and ultimately live and work independently in India.

It was a work exchange at an independent school run by a fantastic couple: John and Ching. I assisted in teaching kids English by creating activities for younger students and having conversation with elder students. I also did general work: house chores, cooking, and babysitting. It felt like living with a great family rather than working. I wish I did more. Perhaps it was the heat (and lack of air conditioner), or the mosquitoes at night, or Ching's delicious food that hindered me. I stayed until my visa nearly ran out.

March 2012 - July 2012?
Independent Game Developer in San Francisco
I went back without a job to see what San Francisco really offered me. I spent most of the time working on Pinkies Up, and staying open for collaboration. I concluded San Francisco is too gentrified and too business oriented, consisting of shallow business-card trading meetups and funding the next Instagram clone. The city lost its heart. The only exception: The MADE in Oakland and Creative Coders.

January - February 2012
Volunteer at Babycastles in Brooklyn, NY
Ahhh my first love. Amazing people doing amazing things. It was specifically what I was interested in, but had no idea a community for it existed. It was what I was looking for all along. At the time I was just beginning to create things myself (game prototypes), figuring out what games are, what it means to be an artist, and really delve into fine arts. The things these people accomplished on a daily basis was unbelievable. I merely helped setup and facilitate art game installations, and helped (or worsened) with organizational development. I regret leaving New York because of these people, and I will come back, despite disliking the city.

January - February 2012
Intern at zdLLdz in Brooklyn, NY
Interning with Zack. Woo! I assisted with a film shoot in the freezing cold and researched stereoscopy in film and games (read: ate pizza and watched dope movies). Still, it was inspiring to just be around Zack. Zack is the future, and the other interns are equally futuristic.

February - May 2011
QA and Release Engineer at Perfect World Entertainment in Foster City, CA
From suburb to city, I picked up a new job too quickly, perhaps afraid of financial risk. I oversaw day-to-day tasks for the engineering department. The department creates and manages websites and web servers for a bunch of shitty Asian MMORPGs. It was a cumbersome process in a large company. Unrealistic goals, overtime, hasty testing, shoving out *milestones*; The stereotyped horrifically inefficient software company. I knew and warned that I was going to leave within the first week, but I stuck to the job because I was still absorbing the experience, mainly related to living in San Francisco. I tried to help the company as much as I could but I came to the conclusion that my radical (in their perspective) input was meaningless in a large company, and my desire for something more meaningful, or at least more meaningful than managing websites for terribly bland MMORPGs, made me leave.

February - October 2010
Software Developer at Segin Systems in Virginia Beach, VA
My first "professional" job. I developed code for their flagship web based real estate software. Most of the time was spent implementing interfaces to scrape data from ancient third party title software databases to be sent via web services. The rest of the time was spent extending the superbly coded web site, written by the lead developer who made fine use of the .NET framework. An amazing first programming job as there were only two other developers, and most of the time was spent programming. I knew I was going to leave my hometown, but I thought it was best to have a little "experience" before doing so.

August 2005 - May 2009
Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at Old Dominion University in Norfolk, VA
I wasted a lot of time. Only one class was okay, the one where our class was told to build a web forum with few restrictions. I did, however, value the time I watched artsy movies and spent with my friends, often playing games, almost solely Super Smash Bros. Melee.

2003 - Death
Temporary Manager at Village Motel in Chesapeake, VA
This is my Dad's motel. Yep, I'm the second generation of the stereotype Indian immigrant hospitality-business owning family. It's what paid for my raising, including college. A stable business to raise a family. It takes a surprising amount of civil engineering and hackery to maintain motels.

Childhood:
Playing games with friends, biking, exploring neighborhoods, eating, family vacations, family events (Indian marriages), fixing computers, fixing other things, staying up late, waking up late, always doing something.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Japanese Arcades</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[9/14/13 written in Japan:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_xZKKt_zic

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VFOCChBpew

Hahahah. Those girls exist. Yeahp, I'm only staying here for a week. 'Tis the end.

JAPANESE ARCADE GAME REPORT:

games that I thought were fun:
http://kotaku.com/5984491/in-this-racing-game-you-shake-a-pig
  - amazing GIF comments
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkF72uxDm-g

Oh my. Just found this on the internet in related videos:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8cTdFqwdwc

Otherwise, the arcades are all very similar. So similar that genres are physically separated by floors: CLAW MACHINES and photo booths, technical / RTS (very calculating, army strategy, cards that are read digitally games, simulators), gambling (panchinko, mahjong), music (DDR, the ones I linked), and normal (mario kart racing machines, armored core with dual joysticks, retro, fighters, etc.).

written now:
I went to a few arcades in Tokyo. It was a very odd experience. I guess not too different from entering an arcade in a mall, just larger.

The games were separated in a way that fit the desires of its intended audience.

The first floor often had photo-booths and claw machines. Feminine people went to photo-booths. Couples went to claw machines.

Females and males, perhaps equally, enjoy the rhythm games. It was also perhaps the most social area. People would play a DDR game, watch, and talk.

Males usually enjoy the technical, calculating, statistics-based games. Some of these games were really really in depth. It felt like a weird office. I imagine they make good stock market brokers.

The gambling games floor were full of smoke and old dudes and few dudetts wasting their life away, similar to Panchinko parlors. It was also unbearably loud and smelly. Actually, my Dad plays a lot of FreeCell, so perhaps it also has that meditative feeling of no-brain smartphone games. I never quite understood, but people do enjoy it, especially after a long day of work. Though, those people didn't seem as if they had work either.

The first floor is where it's at. In addition to the claw machines and photo-booths, there's a bunch of random games thrown together. In one arcade, there were two games in the front: a Taiko (drum) rhythm game and a racing game with a pig controller. These two games attracted the most diverse audience, likely hence their placement at the front. Multiplayer Mario Kart is always good too. Anything more complex failed in attracting a diverse audience, including those two joystick robot fighting games.

From my perspective, nearly all of it was odd, and I wanted no part in it. This was quite a surprise as I grew up with games. But here, it really felt a social barrier existed. There wasn't any couches, or a place for food. It was just games. The designers of Japanese arcades entirely missed the social aspect of arcades.

For the most part, the people who played were really did fit the stereotypes the games were directed toward. The arcade player, the old panchinko dude, young girls at photo-booths, and random passer-byers for the games in the front and claw machines.

There was also a feeling that many people came after work for some time of relief from life. It was apparent at many moments, as they're still wearing their business clothes. Some even come for lunch break, which I thought is kind of awesome.

Otherwise, as a person who likes games, a disappointment. I believe I only stayed in Tokyo for a week, but from what I experienced, I am glad to not have gone to Japan directly after college, as I had actually thought about. Japan might have games, but they are insular.

I guess the nice Nintendo games are intended for houses, and "arcade games" are intended for arcades.

Arcades in America have nearly died out, especially so in cities. People who like games are saddened by this because games are part of culture, and a space with games was likely a part of their lives. I agree, but these Japanese arcades, which are quite similar to the arcades one finds inside of a mall in an American suburb, failed to progress with time. They are relics. America doesn't really need these, it needs a new arcade.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>A Personal Statement for Design And Technology</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Written for a certain program's application.

<strong>Outline reasons for applying to the program</strong>
The reason I’m applying is because I want to place myself among diverse people with great potential. I’ve been traveling for the past year or so, and I still haven’t been to a place as publicly accessible for human development as New York. I plan to go back, and I want to start it right.

In my experience, compared to NYU ITP, Parson’s alumni seem a bit better rounded. I probably fit the NYU ITP stereotype: overly excited, inconsistent, ambitious, childish; I think I’d work well with a more straight edged Parson’s person, providing the impulse in the team, as I have with past collaborators. I can do the crazy fun experimentation in my free time (Babycastles!).

I also think the curriculum is better suited to create relationships. Collaboration studio and research labs are really appealing to me. The ITP-like electives are still there too.

In what ways will I contribute to the program
Myself: my crazy street-life perspective, my need for universalism – everyone in the world should be able to play my games, my need to have fun while doing all of this, my reluctance to compromise, pushing myself, the people around me, and hopefully, design.

<strong>Thoughtful description of my background</strong>
[Replacing with description of self, as my background is covered in resume and portfolio]

I self-diagnosed myself to have schizoid personality disorder (SPD). I often withdraw from social situations, have narrow focus, have trouble maintaining relationships, and am indifferent to social norms, despite all of this, I require interaction with people, especially those that I admire or have similar objectives, even if my objectives often change. I rely on communities and/or games to be social. I've been struggling with interaction with people my whole life.

<strong>Tentative plan of study or area of inquiry in the field as I envision it</strong>
When I travel I often have extreme, schizoid-affected feelings from external stimuli. I become extremely playful and confident, as I was in my childhood. I want to explore everything, do everything, and talk to everyone; Empiricism; Learning through play. 

My life’s objective is this: I want to make people always feel that the world is a playground, the way I feel while traveling, that there's always the option to stay out, to physically explore, play, socialize, collaborate, with friends, family, and strangers of all classes of society alike, maximizing physical social time, therefore maximizing memories.

I think in daily life useful interaction can be maximized, filling in non-interactive gaps -- public interaction via big games, played with the people around, something anyone can stumble over in a city: in the park, on the subway, inside, and outside; To decrease academic and art barriers, to prevent the social barrier from forming, talk to people, and maintain playfulness. Playfulness begets confidence.

I want to spend time thinking about how to increase meaningful public interaction, especially different classes of society, via thought experiments, and design several solutions on paper. I want to find more ways for people to extract information from the physical world, including people. I want people to interact more physically.

<strong>Professional goals</strong>
Create non-digital public games. Create a game that results a positive influence on society. Create a specific, useful application or device. Research public interaction, and perhaps the psychological influences it has on people, especially those with schizoid-like symptoms. Start a professional new media studio.

<strong>How graduate program will help realize goals</strong>
People, time, equipment, studio-type classes, current workshops, and professors. Isn’t that how art schools work? If I run a physical public game jam, I can expect people to come. I think the studio courses will help me manage a studio.

<strong>Address anticipated opportunities and challenges</strong>
I anticipate working with companies via collaborative studio, join research labs for specific applications: education, biotechnology, etc; assist professors with their research.

I also think it would be nice to collaborate with other departments for more artsy things.

The challenge won’t be to create art or a product; I can do that. The challenge will be to consistently, positively impact society, and eat while doing it.

<strong>Future career expectations</strong>
Installation maker at the American Museum of Natural History. Playground designer. Elementary school activity maker. MIT-researcher for biotechnology media. Useful toolmaker for medicine and education.

Contrarily, I’d probably be content living in New York, doing a simple job, collaborating with artist friends, many I hope will come from graduate school.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Prologue:
I didn't know about the event it's based on, just as I didn't know about the event Nobody Knows was based on.

Body:
Distance by Hirokazu Koreeda is powerful because the psychology of the characters feel real, and it questions the differences between perpetrators and non-perpetrators.

The film starts with a sci-fi plot. A cult-titled group of people poisoned Tokyo waters, which kills and injures many. Gladly, it's not a sci-fi flick either.

It quickly jumps to real characters shown in their natural settings, a glimpse of each character's lives. Each character with a different personality and time in life.

They meet in pairs. Then, altogether, they embark their journey, and it feels like a travel film, one of a group of friends who haven't met for quite some time. A hand-held camera follows the action, by car and by foot. As they meet each other, we (the audience) also meet them, understand them, and feel for them.

Once the car is gone, a sense of horror emerges. Gladly, it's not a horror flick. Although, the rest of the film remains haunting.

After mourning the group's car gets stolen and they meet with one of the remaining cult members and sleep at the cult's hideout. It becomes night. The camera gives a beautiful dark hue. The character's emotions are mirrored by their dark images, splotches of black across their face.

Flashbacks of their cult counterparts string more bits of story, before and after they joined the cult. Before, they are shown in a mystic atmosphere, appearing quite normal. After, quite crazy when in contact with normal society.

Flashback interviews of each relative at a previous time, probably real interviews of each actor as Koreeda conducted for After Life and previous documentary works, adds even more realism and character.

As with watching any of Koreeda's films, one deeply contemplates. The film's lack of action and consistent display of characters asks for contemplation. About the character's lives (the family's relatives), their cult siblings, and how the average person can be swayed into doing something wrong without feeling one is doing something wrong. The difference between good and bad is a state of psychology.

As the relatives sit in the living room or around a fire, and contemplate about their siblings, god, and life, one can imagine them as a cult. How are the different from their siblings? If they stay in that room for a long period of time, would they begin to develop certain values different from the norms of society? How do societies develop? If any group of people is stuck in a room, what are the chances of the outcome being wrong?

Instead of directly showing motives, who, what, or why something wrong happens, we take a moment to conjecture how something wrong forms, and in doing so, it provides a more truthful answer.

Epilogue:
It's been 1 year and 3 months since I left the States. This film strikes the first moment I've spent hours afterwards in wonder.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I decided to play a game, alone.

It has been a very long time. Steam informs me almost a year.

It's weird to do something alone now.

I tried Costume Quest, and despite it having a funny little script, good humor, a Halloween theme, nostalgia of my upbringing in suburban America, and an all around great production, it's still a genre game. Therefore it did not appeal to me. Furthermore it carries over the cons of JRPGs: chore quests like finding things, a JRPG battle system of which numbers do not matter and fighting requires no tactics or brainpower, 'n some other junk. I stopped very early in.

Then I played Proteus. I walked from one side of the island to the other, at awe at the visual and audio, quickly concluding it was a simple audio-visual experience. It reminded me of a 3d version of <a href="http://archive.globalgamejam.org/2012/seasons-0">Seasons</a> [made during NY GGJ 2012]. Something fitting as an installation piece at a museum.

I nearly turned it off. I didn't. Instead, I decided to circle the island, just to soak it in for a few more minutes.

That was a crucial decision point. The first 5 minutes of any media. And it was successful.

I played through the rest of the game. Exploring. Every sight picture worthy. Interacting with everything, wanting to hear what new sounds come, what new animation occurs. The little crabs and their tribal drum music, the bunny-like creatures, the amazing sounding owl, the elusive white bunny, dandelion seed heads floating about, stars, fireflies. And through all the seasons. A partly cloudy beautiful spring, an equally beautiful summer, looking into the sun causes vision to go white, autumn brings the leaves down and even more rain and clouds just below the mountain, and the climactic, dreamy winter. It was like traveling through a digital world, with all the interactions in tact. Traveling, while in reality it's raining outside and I'm on my computer.

Perhaps it's not much of a game, as there aren't many rules. It takes a single element found in many great games, exploration, and singles it out, resulting in a minimalist experience. The slow-moving, cinematic, 3d exploration of Shadow of the Colossus or any Bethesda game. Then adding a little interaction. Perhaps it's proof, proof that games can evoke feelings.

Nah, never mind that thought. There just isn't enough game to prove that here. It's an audio-visual experience with very little input. My proof of this statement via thought experiment: If I had watched the game instead of playing it, I think it would have offered the same experience.

Game or not, it's a worthy experience, one I value more than most of the games available on Steam.


Something worth mentioning: <a href="http://vimeo.com/47943812">Bad Trip</a> by Alan Kwan has a similar exploratory feel with little interaction, with the addition of containing memories of its creator.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I coincidentally watched 幫幫我愛神 (Help me, Eros) directed by 李康生 (Lee Kang Sheng) and produced by long-time collaborator 蔡明亮 (Tsai Ming Liang) during a depression.

Similar to Tsai Ming Liang's films, it's minimalist, containing four characters, all of whom suffer from city isolation.

Compared to Tsai Ming Liang's early films (Rebels of the Neon God and Vive L’Amour), Help me, Eros has more fantastic elements. It contains at least one dream, and the sex scene is quite dreamy too. The eccentric costumes of betel nut girls, the neon lights of the stand, the upscale apartments, all add to the fantastic atmosphere.

Yet, it is nearly all naturally shot in some random city in Taiwan. The blend of contemporary realism and fantasy forms a dark reality. The call center and stock market provide a good view of underrepresented occupations at the time. Betel nut beauties are real too [I live in Taiwan]. Technology is included, with the use of instant messaging, even more specifically a situation where the profile picture is used, and even the Asian-necessary selfie. Another great example of the blend: brand printed logos (think Gucci) are shot across the bodies of the characters during a threesome.

The isolation here is possibly even more extreme, perhaps at the sacrifice of realism, than Tsai's early films. A tub full of eels, an ostrich omelette, fucking three girls simultaneously, marijuana plants, millions of dollars wasted, a carp being scraped alive, an ostrich fetus. Gluttony of extremely isolated people in Taiwan. Something that probably has never been shown before.

Yet, despite the extremes, the characters feel real. Betel nut beauties derived from a marketing campaign in a farming area in Taiwan. At one point the Betel nut girl goes back to farm, crying, missing a moment she had, only to come back and proceed to sell Betel nuts. The chubby character Cupcake is fat because her boyfriend is in the army, and later found dead by poison. The main character is a trope, but even I've experienced a few people like him in my life: rich and lonely.

The film plays fine throughout at a familiar pace. I didn't have to take a break.

Still, for some reason, perhaps it was the fantastic elements, or the lack of dramatic elements, or even my own state of depression, the climax of the film didn't have a profound effect on me as Tsai's earlier films have. The characters are there, but I cared less for them. Perhaps it is because the characters are older, already transformed and fallen into their occupations. In Tsai's earlier films, the characters are younger, the arcade street kid in Rebels... and a masturbating teen in Vive L’Amour are relatable. Help Me, Eros felt more like an observance of underserved people in extreme states. There is little transformation of the characters. Actually, now that I think about it, there is none. All of the positive actions failed; Nothing changes. All of the characters continue on their initial path, deceived by hope during loneliness.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I watched 河流 (The River) in a still funky mood, unable to respond to external stimuli, isolated from the world.

The more films of Tsai Ming-Liang I watch, the more I feel similar to him. Or is it, because my current state of depression that I feel similar to the feelings his films express?

Like Tsai's other films, it contains common themes: extreme isolation, water leaks, a slow, contemplative pace, and even similar characters. After watching a few of his films, one starts to believe that the main character is based on him, and perhaps the family is based off his own. Maybe his films are the extremes of his family.

When I started traveling, I had fascination with what people do, especially craftsmen that could be seen on the first level of buildings, or on streets of Asia. Similarly, I feel Tsai has this fascination as the processes of a chiropractor, acupuncture, prayers, and other traditional ceremonies are shown. He also has an eye for unseen places: a traditional bathhouse, a temple, old apartments, a river. Tsai sees the world as a traveler, a foreigner, and therefore it is interesting, because everything feels new. As Jenova Chen states in one of the three ways games could effect adults as they do children, the film "intellectually, whereby the work reveals a new perspective about the world that you have not seen before."

A random note: Media is always shown on the side in his films. It seems he feels media is not real. It shouldn't affect the lives of people so much.

Kang's character is selfish, independent, yet needs help, nurture. When near his father he doesn't feel hungry. He's not experiencing life during these times. He needs be on his own.

The film is overwhelmingly bleak. Although there are very tension-ridden scenes, I didn't feel as much drama here as his first two films because of the bleakness.  Still there are very strong scenes.

After a male Oedipus Rex plot twist, there's an image of his father, black and blue hues with a speck of white light in his eyes that haunts far after, which segues into the main character going into the light, unwittingly.

The strongest scene for me was the mother's reaction after seeing her son in the hospital. She leans in an elevator, pressing the close button and random floors, unable to make her next move. Actually, the scene sums the film. All of the characters suffer like neck pain from extreme isolation, a lack of nurture, and love. Out of desperation, they look for nurture in wrong places, unable to move on, stuck, in an elevator.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The extended winter weather in Taipei has caused my mind to become hallow. No feeling for travel or people, or to be social. Now is a good time to self-assess.

<a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/a-self-assessment">Last time I assessed myself</a>, it was objective, written to be displayed to the public alongside my portfolio. It hides subjectivity and psychology, which I now want to explore.

To explore this, I must recall the feelings I had during each point in time of my history, observe it, rationalize it.

Contents:
<a href="#history">A History</a>
<a href="#self-assessment">A Psychological Self-assessment</a>

<a id="history">A History</a>

Virginia:
School and media.

During summer breaks in school, I didn't have work, so I'd spend a lot of time biking, exploring nearby neighborhoods.

During the fall and especially winter, I'd barely be able to wake up, sleeping through the first one or two classes. I'd stay up playing video games late night in my Dad's office.

In college, I'd continue sleeping in. I spent a lot of time watching great films and playing Super Smash Bros. with my friends.

San Francisco:
A new city. A drastic increase in interaction with the public on a daily basis. A life alone. So much time, despite the long working hours and commute. A great leap forward compared to the last 21 years of life.

Yet it was a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat_race">rat race</a>. I worked for 8-10 hours and commuted for 4 hours. I was self-motivated by external factors: travel and survival. I took the job because I wanted to live in the city. Explore.

I spent the weekends traveling at full-speed. Going to new neighborhoods, eating at Yelp-rated restaurants, attending art events, all scheduled ahead of time to maximize experience. It was superficial.

It was fine for the moment, but I don't think I could do it again. It lasted less than 5 months.

New York:
Perhaps the rat race conditioned me to have a work-heavy (work-life balance) life in New York. I spent 80% of the time working on my own games in Pratt Institute's library. Working on something for 10+ hours a day, because I was self-motivated to do so. I thought, as long as I worked as hard as I did at a 9-5 toward work with a much higher standard than any job would I could get would allot; The time would be much more valuable, and therefore, in case I did need money, I would still be able to get a job -- a better one. It was my own work. My own ideas. Why not work hard at it?

Turns out it was a failure because I failed to balance work-life. The designs were mediocre. Productive, somewhat innovative, poor execution. I failed to get verification for my work. I should have invested more time in social life.

After the initial exploration day, I explored very little, interacted very little with people. I only attended game events and comedy nights (my friend and roommate was a comedian), especially those related to Babycastles. I volunteered at Babycastles and interned for Zack Lieberman. Otherwise, it mostly involved work and exercise (running outside at night). It was a very narrow lifestyle.

Travel in Asia:
An escape from the rat race, yet I was still racing.

Taiwan:
I travelled Taipei for nine days struggling to make a decision for work: teach, volunteer, what am I doing? I thought traveling was a waste of time, unproductive.

I quickly found and volunteered at a school in Taiwan for two months. I assisted in teaching kids English by creating activities for younger students and having conversation with elder students. I also did general work: house chores, cooking, and babysitting. In retrospect, I feel a lot of it was still traveling: eating, learning Chinese, and fighting mosquitos.

I then spent two weeks traveling around Taiwan, using CouchSurfing twice. It mostly involved talking to hostel workers, CouchSurfing hosts, traveling, and eating lots of Taiwanese food. I feel that the expiration of my visa kept me going. I flew to Singapore.

Singapore:
Left the terrible city immediately for Malaysia.

Malaysia:
I went to Kuala Lumpur and struggled. It's possible the heat drove me crazy. The goal was to make a film, but most of the time I wandered, ate, and failed to make film. I had footage of the worship of the three cultures of Malaysia: South India's Hinduism, Islam, and Chinese Bhuddism. There was a lot of time wasted looking for better hostels.

I then went to Penang. I was fascinated by the traditional craftsmen there. I just love people who physically make things themselves as a living, and a traveller can physically see them all by walking along the streets. I began interviewing them, asking them questions. Then the film went on to cover the current gentrification of Penang and how the craftsmen would disappear. Then, while filming the craftsmen, I chose a delivery man, as the film would be more dynamic, and made a short film of just this single subject. I never bothered to complete the initial film. I also spent a week or so sick with gastroenteritis. The believe heat drove me nuts here too, driving me to see the craftsmen, old buildings, and try new foods.

Thailand:
In Bangkok I struggled again, as I did in Kuala Lumpur. Spending more time than I should have. I didn't even wander as much. I'd was trying to figure out my next direction. A gritty film about prostitution? Isn't that overly-exposed already? The heat drove me nuts yet again, leaving me in indecision. I finally decided to keep moving, north.

I spent one day in Chiang Mai, and felt it was completely touristy. I decided to take trip through northwest Thailand via motorcycle. It was an odd experience. I mostly stuck to myself as I did in San Francisco the second time. I'd spend a few hours driving my motorcycle during the day, find a place to sleep, write some game ideas, and do some programming. There was an odd assortment of fascinating places: a town full of Yunnanese people who were part of the KMT and fled, mountain towns, dull transport towns, all full of kind and happy people. It was quick, one town per day, but it felt great. Motorcycle is the definitive way to travel, to consume the most, yet be an individual and make one's owns observations. There was little to no social interaction as I can't speak Thai.

Laos:
After I made the motorcycle loop, I still had two weeks to do something before I go to India. I decided to go to Laos. It was my "Into the Wild". I took a 48+ hour bus ride to the mountainous Phitsanoluk. I saw a market where tribal peoples from nearby villages barter wild game. I rented a second hand Chinese motorcycle and found mounds of trash. An odd mix of tribal peoples, recent goods lent from China (motorcycles, farm machinery, cell phones, TVs, power lines, packaged foods), and the beginning of giving technology to an undeveloped country. It contained lowest amount of intelligence I've encountered. The boat rides down river held the tone of Apocalypse Now, with tribal kids running around naked, parents picking up packages of cigarettes.

India:
I failed.

I had planned to make games, but I just couldn't spend the time to do it. The warm weather drove me to go outside. Explore. I'd wander through nearby slums, hang out with my Uncle, experience the hugely contrasting social classes of India. The strict schedule of my relatives restricted my exploration. When they left, I began buying vegetables from the local market and cooking myself.

A friend came with the intention to make a game using India as an inspiration. We ended up doing a game development workshop instead. It's more social.

I finally decided to go through East Asia to empirically decide which city is best to live in.

East Asia:
[link East Asia?]

Taipei:
When I was in Taipei for three months to study Mandarin, I experienced the Apex of my Schizoid Personality Disorder.

Was it <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_alienation#Self-estrangement">self-estrangement</a>? Self-estrangement can be defined as “the psychological state of denying one’s own interests – of seeking out extrinsically satisfying, rather than intrinsically satisfying, activities...”.[32] It could be characterized as a feeling of having become a stranger to oneself, or to some parts of oneself, or alternatively as a problem of self-knowledge, or authenticity.

Schizoid Personality Disorder:
Not having a normal social life, which also affects schedule.
[think about, create article? see nomadic article]

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizoaffective_disorder
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypomania

The brain includes several distinct dopamine systems, one of which plays a major role in reward-motivated behavior.

Abnormally high dopaminergic transmission has been linked to psychosis and schizophrenia.

Studies with sensory deprivation have shown that the brain is dependent on signals from the outer world to function properly. If the spontaneous activity in the brain is not counterbalanced with information from the senses, loss from reality and psychosis may occur after some hours. A similar phenomenon is paranoia in the elderly, when poor eyesight, hearing and memory make the person abnormally suspicious of the environment.
On the other hand, loss from reality may also occur if the spontaneous cortical activity is increased so that it is no longer counterbalanced with information from the senses. The 5-HT2A receptor seems to be important for this, since psychedelic drugs that activate them produce hallucinations.

the acute effects of dopamine stimulants include euphoria, alertness and over-confidence

the main feature of psychosis is not hallucinations, but the inability to distinguish between internal and external stimuli.

Psychosis has been traditionally linked to the neurotransmitter dopamine. In particular, the dopamine hypothesis of psychosis has been influential and states that psychosis results from an overactivity of dopamine function in the brain, particularly in the mesolimbic pathway. The two major sources of evidence given to support this theory are that dopamine receptor D2 blocking drugs (i.e., antipsychotics) tend to reduce the intensity of psychotic symptoms, and that drugs that boost dopamine activity (such as amphetamines and cocaine) can trigger psychosis in some people (see amphetamine psychosis).[67] However, increasing evidence in recent times has pointed to a possible dysfunction of the excitory neurotransmitter glutamate, in particular, with the activity of the NMDA receptor.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This post is part of <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/a-self-assessment-ii">a self-assessment II</a>

A surprisingly great factor in my life.

I theorize there's an association to weather and dopamine. I feel sunlight and heat release more dopamine, exaggerating the input of external stimuli. Without sunlight and heat, external stimuli is blunted.

TODO: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seasonal_affective_disorder">Seasonal Affective Disorder</a>, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_disorder

In Guns, Germs, and Steel, one of the probable answers by scientists for why people in Papua New Guinea did not have "cargo" (technology) is "the inhibitory effects of tropical climate (heat and humidity), and on human creativity and energy." I was unable to Google much about this, but looking at the locations of Global cities, it's possible.

I will divide my experience according to temperature and amount of sunlight: "<strong>summer</strong>" (high heat, high amount of sunlight), "<strong>winter</strong>" (low heat, low amount of heat), and "<strong>normal</strong>" (temperate heat and sunlight). Quotes are used because the season doesn't matter, the actual temperature and sunlight do. In addition, I've moved several times in my life into different climates.

<strong>Summer:</strong>
I am more inclined to go outside, stay in the sun, socialize, and am generally happier.

I want to stay out, on the streets, consuming more information externally by traveling -- learning languages, thinking about others lives, anthropology, developing a care for those that struggle (like Tsai-Ming Liang films), seeing the world from the streets, wondering what people do indoors and why anyone would spend time inside. I am actively thinking at all times. Thinking about what to do at every moment, talking to myself (possibly in another language!). In extreme cases, I don't want to spend any time indoors or alone. I become completely extroverted.

I feel more creative. I spend more time thinking about people. I want everything I do to involve a social aspect: art, school, work, and recreation. I wouldn't mind taking a job as long as I am outside and social: a postman, a waiter at an outdoor cafe. My art gravitates toward ones that involve my interaction with other people: Humans of New York and Vincent Moon are of inspiration, as it involves with me simultaneously living and producing.

This coincides my love for games, which is also socially interactive. The problem comes when the game is digital, in which the implementation, programming, is not interactive. At most, one can be in a social place (the common room of a hostel, a public park, a social cafe, at a friend's house, a studio) and do the work alongside others, with little interaction. It is a continuation of striving to find ways to live and work simultaneously.

The con of summer time is that I do less work, or don't want to do any work at all. Or, perhaps, I do not do work that is not social -- programming.

Physically, I drink more water, exercise less, do not suffer from carb-insulin problems, and may happily take a nap after some intense heat.

[link to time in Taipei the second time, travel in Asia]

<strong>Winter:</strong>
<blockquote>~2/14/13 to 8/6/13 in San Francisco the second time:
Buy underclothing to control body warmth.
...
Taking a shower could be a good way to get warm, if exercise does not work.
...
The weather makes a large difference. I need to either live in an area with warm climate or wear underclothing all of the time.
...
The cold weather affects me too. Feel like eating and doing mindless work instead of designing.
</blockquote>

I ignore the world. Traveling and socializing becomes less rewarding. I'd rather stay indoors, only talking to people for a specific purpose. I'm more likely to consume media -- films substitute observation, games substitute interaction). I'm more passive. I can do lonely tasks for a long period of time -- programming, writing, etc. I don't require social feedback. I become introverted.

In San Francisco, the second time, I was able to spend 80% of my time alone in UCSF library, in my room, or in cafes, programming. In New York, I was able to spend 80% of my time in Pratt Institute's library, programming. During both times, the weather was mild to cold.

Physically, I suffer from the winter blues

<strong>Normal</strong>

		<title>Sleeping Problems</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This post is part of <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/a-self-assessment-ii">a self-assessment II</a>

During my first job, I self-diagnosed myself to have <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delayed_sleep_phase_syndrome">Delayed Sleep Phase Syndrome</a>. The wikipedia article described several problems of my life during school. In retrospect, I now know this is only one comorbidity of a larger problem.

There is a clear division of the times I wake up: <strong>delayed</strong>, <strong>inconsistent</strong>, and <strong>on time</strong>.

<strong>Delayed:</strong>
This occurs when I am intrinsically motivated, without external factors affecting me, or during which I have no reactions to external stimuli.

It seems if I have a normal social life or daily schedule -- a job, personal work, school, I can stick to it, somewhat. I just happen to wake up a little later, perhaps 10:30AM. I'd sleep well, wake up spontaneously, feeling refreshed. I adapted my life to fit my body's schedule, resulting in a less social, yet extremely physiologically healthy life. It probably netted in more films then real social activities.

During scheduled work -- school and my first two jobs, I'd choose to come in at 10:30AM to 11:00AM, which is about when my brain wakes up. I'd start out well, but as my motivation waned I came in later. Perhaps I became less excited about life outside of work -- exploring the city, social connections. Or, more likely, my jobs were repetitive, and I failed to find ways to continue being creative in such limits. Eight hours without creativity should make anyone somewhat intelligent mental.

In SF the second time and NY, when I was working on my own things, or things of mutual motivation, I woke up on a delayed schedule. During the summer, I'd often wake up at 10:30AM, but come winter time It would be a lot more inconsistent.

<strong>Inconsistent:</strong>
This occurs during winter depressions, or as previously mentioned, when motivation in work -- school and work -- dwindles.

During winter depression, and even worse, the combination of winter and school or work, the schedule is severely impaired, resulting in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-24-hour_sleep%E2%80%93wake_disorder">Non-24-hour sleep–wake disorder</a>. I'd wake up anywhere between 10:30AM to 4PM, sleeping at inconsistent times, unable to wake up at desired times, advancing my sleeping schedule forward, until I have to reset it.

<strong>On time</strong> (business hours)<strong>:</strong>
Being on time requires my goals to be attached to some external factor.

During the summers of my childhood, I wake up early because I'd want to go out, to enjoy the sun, to have more time to play with my friends, to have more time to explore with my bike. Also during family trips, I'd wake up alongside my family.

During most of my travel in Asia, I woke up on time. Perhaps this is because most people slept or went home when the sun went down. Or, because I was consistently motivated. <em>Travel is special time where intrinsic motivation is affected by external stimuli.</em>

In an extreme case, in Laos, where there was no light or electricity available, I woke up at 5am. Was it because there was no light, I had nothing to do (no computer, no one to talk to, no light to write), or I wanted to wake up with people the next day? Probably a combination of the three.

In another case, I'd wake early if my current goal or objective involved the interaction of other people whom have normal circadian rhythms:

In hostels, I'd often sleep with others, and, I'd wake up at the same time as they did. The action of people getting up in my room served as a time device. It was quite motivating (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_loafing">Social Loafing</a>?), and socially healthy. I loved talking to others while getting ready. Similarly, many families in India live in a single room, waking up together at 5AM. Another reason maybe because I am schizoid and normally don't have anyone to talk to in the morning.

During Humans of Taipei, my main goal was to talk to people, so I'd wake up early to maximize work time. At that point, I was so focused on other people I felt there was no reason to be awake at night as there was nothing for me to do that would advance me toward my goal. I'd sleep happily with the sounds of neighbors and people on the streets from a nearby open window.

--
Being schizoid, it's possible for me to live without any external factors, leading to a misaligned sleep schedule. Intrinsic motivation and a delayed sleep schedule has had the most prolonged routine sleep schedules. The times I was <em>on time</em> were all very temporary. Being inconsistent usually means I was depressed.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Precursor:</strong>
I, the writer, am a foreigner, and I naively write this article from the perspective of one, with a focus on observation and empiricism as opposed to research.

<strong>Summary:</strong>
Sleeping at the Legislative Yuan (立法院) for two nights one can come to understand that Taiwan's autonomous and selfless culture would lead to an entirely technocratic society, if only it weren't strangled by the fear of China.

<strong>Current Status:</strong>
Taiwanese students (and politically unaffiliated academia and NGOs) continue to protest from within the Legislative Yuan and its perimeter, boycotting the expedited review process of the Cross-Strait Service Trade Agreement (CSSTA). The uprising is natural and timely, in March, the time of election and past protests. For the past few years Taiwan's government has been snowballing down leading to an increased connectivity with China, a decrease in President Ma's (馬英九) rating, and increased anxiety of the uncertainty of the future of Taiwan.

<strong>Protest Experience:</strong>
Before I jump into my experience, I think it's important to note that the current protest isn't a completely new phenomenon. From the Wild Lilly movement, to the Wild Strawberry movement, to 2010 under the table deals with China to the forming of the Black Island Youth Alliance, school associations from top universities have teamed with human rights NGOs to mediate the law. They are the seeds of technocracy. Now trained for non-violent protests, they await any wrongful move by the government to pounce on.

<strong>The Autonomy of Taiwan:</strong>
One can only understand this by being born in another country and traveling to Taiwan or sleeping at the Legislative Yuan (LY). I arrived on March 30, after the President's Office rally.

Already, in a matter of days the LY's main podium has now come to include: An information department capable of handling anything including the coordination of student unions inside, outside, and around Taiwan; A goods department which includes 8 tents that provide food, water, raincoats, blankets, other supplies, outside, and one department inside, located near the back door where on the other side a tent resides, all of which are itemized and operated without money; A translation department where news is reported via <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sunflowermovement">social media</a> and replied as requested by foreign reporters; A recycling center; A medical department which includes modern medicine, traditional Chinese medicine, and a person at the main hall's door who checks temperature by pointing a gun at your forehead, rewarding you with hand sanitizer, set near the front door in case people need to be taken in or out.

Built like a well-planned fort, more convenient than a Taiwanese 7-11, the students have created self-sustainable town equipped with its own service sector inside the the heart of government, a mirror of it's economy, now 73% service-oriented, and its past form of government: martial law.

Such autonomy begs two questions. Does Taiwan need more help? No. They've fared extremely well with their current relations and export / import rates. Of course, more entrepreneurship opportunities would be nice. Does Taiwan <em>want</em> more help? Only if they can retain their status quo.

<strong>A Microcosm of Taiwan's Society:</strong>
Riot police restrict certain areas. The police wait at the parliament's entrances. A line of ten Taiwanese TV and radio companies waiting for the next speech by student leaders, 70% of which may be considered pro-KMT. Despite the seriousness of it all, the culture of Taiwan, the "strawberry generation", causes me, a foreigner, to view it a very unusual and seemingly unserious ordeal that highlights the characteristics of Taiwan's society: polite, passive, uncompetitive, competent, social, open, and caring.

Outside, students sleep on aluminum blankets, cardboard boxes, and connectable styrofoam puzzle pieces. They eat baozi (包子) and biandang (便當), read books, follow social media, as if it were a college courtyard. Cute handicrafts, sunflowers, and cardboard signs pervade the public walls. Films are played on projectors. Music performances are staged. A 7-11 on the block remains open and crowded. A line of riot police face a line of sunflower-holding students. Government buildings have been cutely reupholstered. Inside the artfully-draped LY their culture concentrates.

The entrance guarded by police without weapons; The only difference between a policeman and a security guard is their uniform. One's ability to enter relies entirely on perceived disposition of the current guard, foreigner or not, an expression of indisrimination. The front door to the hall is blocked by a Katamari Damacy ball of lay-z-boys and other excess furniture. An extra line of security guards sit and play popular smartphone games -- Candy Crush and Clash of Titans -- during the day and nap in the same seat during the night.

The main lobby and courtyard are usually empty, holding an occasional interview.

On the first floor there's a break room with movie theater style seating and a tiny TV playing the news. People discuss democracy and relax, probably similar to the legislatures that normally lounge there.

Upstairs, climbing a ladder over a barricade, the second floor contains: bathrooms with shower supplies, more conference rooms, which is where the most important people meet and make decisions, and entrances to the balcony of the main hall.

The main hall, split into a few sections: the podium full of aforementioned departments, the floor where students and professors sit in circles and discuss sociology and politics, a row of new reporter cameras, and the tables and empty space behind where students live, is a dream.

Handicraft art decorates the walls: handwritten letters and signs. More Katamari Damacy balls of excess things. Cardboard signs were created for each department. More junk is used to make a dinosaur overnight. White tape outlines on the floor depicting places where students sat. A ventilation duct hangs from the second floor window like a giant playground slide.

Taiwanese people are masters of DIY culture. Give them reason and they will competently accomplish any given task, monetarily efficient and with cultural flair.

Tables are littered with packaged food and drinks on the tables, magically cleaned every day just as night markets are. The floor filled with students sleeping at any moment of time, playing smartphone games, using social media to talk to friends, taking occasional selfies. Students sit where legislatures normally do. The most formally dressed person I spotted: a female reporter wearing a suit with a mini skirt and converse sneakers.

People hang out, socialize, sleep, shower, eat, study, and work. The LY is now a workplace and a home. The LY is now the smallest town in Taiwan.


<strong>Two Nights at the Legislative Yuan:</strong>
Night 1, March 30:
During the Presidential Office rally on March 30, 500,000+ people marched the 10-lane Ketagalan Boulevard with such pleasant conduct that lanes has separate uses: for sitting, walking forward, walking backward, and emergency vehicles. The flow of the march was so smooth that it took a mere fifteen minutes to walk from the President's office to the Legislative Yuan. The atmosphere akin to a rather corporate music festival, as expected with such a large crowd. As one arrives to the original protest site, energy increases while still retaining harmony, with art, posters, tents, speakerphones, discussions, music, and film.

It's amazing to see such a diverse crowd, people from all parts of society, act in unison. In comparison, at Occupy Wall St., one can expect schizophrenic beggars dishing out non-sense alongside debt-filled students having heated discussions with big businessmen. It's clear if something wrong happens, the public will react with great solidarity.

Night 2, March 31:
Bai Lang (白狼) said in a press conference that he and 2000 of his men would come to the Legislative Yuan at 3AM. At 3AM, the students remain unchanged, half asleep. When I asked a NTU student why [students are not stressed], he said, many don't know, and the others think it's highly unlikely that anything awful would happen.

I saw fear in the faces of students, not of Bai Lang, but of the government, but they continued with uncertainty with the prevalent reply of, "I don't know what to do". An example: my friend, a half-mainlander, encountered a college student who was furious at his existence, but the most she could do was make a half-angry face for a few seconds with an urge to tell other people. Several people I've talked to over my past few months in Taiwan also exhibit this helpless attitude, not just for politics, but of anything. Further reinforcement that Taiwanese people are non-violent and selfless, or, in the way my friend puts it, "lacking testosterone".

<strong>Now and Later:</strong>
The movement has been, for the most part, and comparatively to other concurrent uprisings, peaceful, perhaps even seen as "weak", and possibly therefore overshadowed globally by other news. Yet, it's clear that under Ma's presidency, China has been slowly ingesting Taiwan, a country with the 19th largest economy, equal to Australia, and double that of Hong Kong.

The students still only ask for one thing, a review of the bill. That's powerful, as many other protests take on broader ideologies and become criticized because its lack of precise objectives (Occupy Wall St.).

As of now, it's a passive stalemate.

If Ma gives the bill a rightful review, would everything resume as normal? Or at this point, does Ma even matter? Can Taiwan's inherently non-violent passive society take further action and further pressure the KMT?

Or will the fear from past government actions (White Terror, Executive Yuan incident) and China in general (1600 missiles aimed at Taiwan) prevent the students from taking further action?

The moment is pivotal.

With an autonomous society lacking political testosterone, one would hope Taiwan will continue in a technocratic way without political affiliations, in the hands of its newly founded elite: the students (academia), begin another Taiwan Miracle, and become a country founded on intelligence, a seemingly perfect government. Unfortunately, a relationship with China continually flaws it.

As for me, a foreigner, there seems to be only two things to do: inform foreign media, and criticize or dominate the core decision-making group to incite action, with very very poor spoken Chinese skill.

add rules to the game, perhaps just writing a doodle at the start is enough
colors, rules can define what they do: green for good, red for bad, etc.

		<title>Nomadism, Culture, and The Playful Quest for Knowledge</title>
		<link>http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/nomadism-culture-and-the-playful-quest-for-knowledge</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[As a very empirical person, that is, a person who has been taught mostly through empiricism, some important questions arise: How was knowledge [historically] obtained, what is the most optimal way of gaining new knowledge, and how does one create new knowledge.

I take a break from programming for a contract. Rote work. It's too late to be around people to figure out a way to make this rote task playful, fun, meaningful (learning something, social). Or, recently, I've become less playful. As I procrastinate my work, I begin to wonder why.

Let's ignore my biological problems of low dopamine, ADHD, SPD, etc.

People [should] gravitate toward knowledge.

How did I gather knowledge? Not passively, that's for sure. I've [interactively] explored my neighborhood as kid, watched several films, explored big American cities, and a good portion of Asia. I've worked a few jobs to get enough money, but only to get enough, to afford further exploration, further knowledge.

Why has travel been so effective? What is travel? The latter's common answer is that travel is about culture -- language, customs, history, genetic differences that lead to a unique social construct. Another answer is meeting people. But isn't the only difference between people of different countries culture? Why not travel one's own country?. The novelty, the differences of my own culture, or more appropriately, the culture I grew around, is interesting, triggering dopamine, just as any new piece of art is. The observation of differences is appealing. But that's temporary. Novelty fades. The dopamine settles.

What was gained from this experience? Could it have been gained in another way? Say, passively, through a book? Would it have been faster (and cheaper!) to learn through a book? How much is learned passively?

I feel that the meaning of travel, or to a more extreme degree, nomadism, isn't just the absorption of another culture, but including, the avoidance of having one's own culture. When one ignores the social constructs of one's own society, one begins to observe further how people create societies, and when one ignores societies altogether (technology, capitalism, etc.), one begins to enter philosophies, in which lies an expanse of knowledge to explore.

One begins to question meaning of language, methods to maximize life, the meaning of life, the development of cities, the anthropology of mountainous peoples, interactive public art, the future of Taiwan, ubiquitous computing, and so on, because it's easier to see once one doesn't live in a social construct. The ability to see this, learn this, is possible without reading the work of Wittgenstein, Alan Turing, and Freud. Furthermore, without reading Tolstoy, Joyce, Dostoevsky, and Kafka; That is, without old and passive medium of books, and perhaps, an old method of learning.

The result: an uneven liberal arts education. So, I guess that answers part of one question, empiricism is, in addition to uneven, inefficient.

But there is a positive notion this lifestyle. It's original. The sources in which these things were learned are completely original, therefore, hopefully, leading to more creative output.

Also, it's fun. I was actively participating along the way. Both of which is required for my personality.

Surely there must be a way to make learning completely efficient, fun, social, thoroughly active, and productive.

Why aren't there any good schools? Good determined by the aforementioned factors.

The internet exists. Why aren't great classes taught by great professors pervading every classroom. In some good college, someone is teaching in a brilliantly fun way, perhaps teachings the physics through a game that uses physics. But would even that be enough?

Humans do seek a social aspect to life, which leads people to cling together into institutions. It creates relationships, which likely leads to work. Is it simply certain interaction between certain people that leads to learning? What is this magic formula [THINK ABOUT THIS MORE]?

But people aren't necessary. I think relationships just happens to lead to a more stable life. Artists and philosophers trap themselves in log cabins, or other parts of the world, to create something, which probably involves learning too.

There is much to learn through media, travel, and people (not just smarts ones). Many smart folks are able to inhale books and learn everything from it instantly. Thinking about this, now it seems the need of having fun, to be creative, is a learning disability.

To be efficient, one must be alone. What one knows and and wants to know is unique. No class perfectly cover the domain of knowledge one desires, and because there is more than one person, it will always possess repetition of known things.

An ideal answer: everyone should have a human professor to teach them exactly what they don't know in a fun way. A real answer: everyone should use online courses fit precisely for what they don't know. That's progress. Now the only thing missing is a social aspect. The active part.

I see three ways for early learning:

To take an online course, and give the burden of creativity to the learner, allowing them to create an activity for themselves to reinforce the knowledge immediately, whilst maintaining the fundamental human needs. It would require much willpower to balance this life, but perhaps, the most efficient if done right.

Or did artists always have it right? Wander around until one finds something they like, explore it deeply, and create something from it? Learning, reinforcing, and creating, and repeating this. The most productive life. Isn't life about productivity anyway? Even at an early age, one can delve deeply. It just would leave the person to stray from the social norms and possibly lead to life problems.

Playful people strive to make life continually playful, keeping within modern social constructs, diverging slightly for the benefit of learning, yet maintaining relationships. It seems to be the most balanced method, but perhaps not straying far enough to explore something deeply enough to create something great enough to further humans or art.

I don't know. I'm tired. And I've got a lot of work to do, which, unfortunately, will not teach me anything new. Certainly, a failure on my part, for not choosing a job that would allow me to learn (or create) more.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Programming, like writing, is a lonely activity, and since traveling, and since becoming a more social person, something I've been unable to do since then, unless I happily spend the entire day socializing, several hours in the sunlight, and then remember to finally sit down in a public social area, such as the durbar squares in Nepal or any park in Taipei or late night in the common room at a lively hostel, to do some work while taking in the culture.

Programming can be fun with a studio of really good friends, but even then, it's likely a studio full of more programmers whom share the same culture -- professional, media consuming, internet-heavy, Pitchfork indie music listening, people. They're not nearly as diverse, interesting, or inspiring as travel.

This has been my bane during my travels. Trying to balance the two. But why have I held onto programming? Why not do something more direct with the people. Am I, at the end, a lone artist? Do I value myself over any other kind of work? Yeah, I think so.

During the time of Humans of Taipei was at the apex of happiness. I loved every moment. That's something to remember.

Very recently I've entered a depression, not unlike my past winter depressions. I'm unable to wake up, I oversleep, I'm not seeking social moments, I'm not seeking or doing anything really, except writing and programming, alone.

What happened? Why did I suddenly give up on the maintenance of my social connections? Why did I fail to continue consuming? Looking at the precise moment, it was a time where I was cleaning my room, starting a programming gig, both solitary activities. It was also getting a little cold too. It also saw more time in my apartment, as opposed to being outside, trying to consume objects (media) instead of life.

Yeahp. The social aspect is missing. And without it, I go into depression. Well, now I do. Before traveling, I was fine without much of a social life, using media to replace life. Now, media isn't enough. I need to be with people at all times.

Fuck you, programming. Fuck you, apartment. Both burdens have so much weight. Perhaps being a teacher is best.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Taiwan and Japan: Active and Passive Lifestyles</title>
		<link>http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/taiwan-and-japan-active-and-passive-lifestyles</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I had to leave Taiwan to renew my visa, so I came to Okinawa, and one day in, I am reminded not just why I dislike the country, but also why I love Taiwan. The difference between the two countries is that the lifestyles -- the way people act in their environment -- are the opposite. Taiwanese people live an active lifestyle; Japanese people live a passive lifestyle (Okinawa may not be a good test sample, but my time in Osaka and Tokyo mirror this).                    

I'm going to step back into the time before I left America.

At that time, I thought Japan would be a really interesting experience. In my perspective, Japan has polite 'n' quirky people, it's the most developed of the East Asian countries, and of course, it probably has the most alien culture of developed countries. I wasn't attracted to the things otakus are; I wanted to see people being as silly as they are in those whacky game shows, who often are shy but react in hilarious ways. Those playful people. 

Before leaving, I thought Japan would be the apex of my trip in Asia. I started in Taiwan and I loved it. Then I decided to go through South East Asia, saving Japan for another trip.

When the time came I checked WikiTravel and planned silly fun things to do: see arcades, sleep at a capsule hotel, sleep at a manga cafe, see fashion trends in harajuku, eat at the fish market, see modern art, talk to people at modern art places, attend a game convention, etc. And although some of those things were fun, the people and environment were not. The fun ended quickly as I was unable to create many social experiences during my travels with people outside of my hostel.

In contrast to my expectations, Japan did not have anything I desired. It was the rest of Asia that I had experienced that did.

Japan's culture is uninteresting to me because people passively consume media. Furthermore, the media they consume is narrow, and over time it becomes more narrow, to the point it becomes alien to the world. The otaku culture that I was not interested in made more sense once I saw Japan. Kids and adults alike over-consume manga, anime, computer medias, pop music, and whatever else. So much time is spent consuming that they don't move. They spend most of their time indoors, reading, playing single player repetitive games, perhaps talking to someone next to them who is doing the same thing.

I wouldn't want to live in a country where the most social interaction is reading next to another person. I want to actually interact with the other person, or at least consume reality -- travel, food, talking.

Everything in Japan takes place either indoors or at machines. Shopping for groceries, buying snacks, ordering at a restaurant, transportation, before work, working, after-work, having fun, all the time. There's nothing to see on the outside. There is no street culture. The most one can witness is the mass of people commuting to and from work in Tokyo's busy areas.

There's not enough <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/creativity-external-stimuli-cities-and-suburbs" title="Creativity, External Stimuli, Cities, and Suburbs">external stimuli</a> for me. And if I can't socialize with the people, then there's no other hope to fulfill my need for it. There's nothing to see or talk to. And I don't enjoy passively consuming, even in the company of others.

Taiwanese people, in contrast live a highly active lifestyle. They're talking all of the time. With their friends next to them or through LINE, to the public (food and drink vendors [not machines!], service industry). Far less spend time is spent playing dull games or consuming dull media in the company of others. Perhaps they will play in a subway, but that is because none of their relations are physically around them.

They even consume a more diverse media. They watch American, Taiwanese, Japanese, Korean, Hong Kong, and Chinese media. All somehow dubbed to Mandarin for the masses. Their English is better. They're curious of other cultures. They want to talk to other people, which is the main motivation to learn a language. In Japan, the people seem to simply not be interested in other cultures, which probably explains their low English rate. A cram school won't help if one isn't actually interested in talking to people who speak the language, or another culture's media.

Even their [Taiwan] environment is highly active. They retain the social street culture similar to poorer countries, which provides as much or even more external stimulus than a developed big city such as New York. Scooters zoom by, day markets flourish with fresh vegetables during the day, night market brings tons of people out to shop, or just to look and walk, or to a nearby mountain or park for a quick meal. Most traditional restaurants are open-air. The senses are blasted with hordes of market strollers and wafts of stinky tofu.

It is this broad-consumption of daily life that allows one to live a more social, happy, creative (socially creative at least [as opposed to creating media]), and active life.

An active life, that is, one is constantly making decisions before taking action. One thinks to call a friend, cook something, go to a park, embark an adventure, not because they were told to, but because one decided themselves to do so.

The narrow passive consumption of Japan is more akin to the suburbs. One consumes the media around them or computer (although the computer is a more interactive form of consumption). The only new stimuli is media (if they chose a new one) and the social experience with people of whom they already have a relationship with (if they even created new relationships outside the ones they were born into i.e. their family).

I would stereotype the two countries' societies as so: Taiwan is the social island nation where the people are always friendly and happy; Japan is the dsytopian future where media and machines replaced human interaction.

I like technology, but only if it has a social aspect.



<blockquote>9/13/13 in Busan
A nation of consumption caused by its culture. Koreans are more introverted, opting to use cell phones to communicate than talk, and TVs to live life rather than going out. It's the suburban Asian nation. Media through Samsung TVs easily influenced the crowd.</blockquote>

I would add South Korea alongside Japan.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Creativity, External Stimuli, Cities, and Suburbs</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[aka materialism.

10/15/13
<blockquote>The more time I spend inside, the less creative I become. I need to spend time outside to feel good, free, worry-free.

Avoid going home. Live outside. There's nothing at the house, except a bed. Only go if I invite people.
</blockquote>

Okinawa reminds me of my hometown, Virginia Beach. Any suburb reminds me of Virginia Beach.

Virginia Beach served me well when I was young, had a bike, and neighborhood friends, but I outlived the area quickly, and then I turned toward media, becoming a more lonely person.

Here, in Okinawa, I find myself in the same position. I've been here for a day and feel there is nothing to do.

Why?

Why did big American cities and less developed Asia offer months of exploration, and why does Okinawa, or any suburb, have nothing to offer?

Clearly this is subjective, perception.

But then again, why do artists live in cities? Is it just the creative jobs, other artists, like-minded people?

I think beyond those reasons external stimuli is at play.

Big cities have tons of events; Less developed Asia has street culture. Both easily accessible by the public. In a single day one simply experiences more because there is more to see and do. On the subway in New York, perhaps a street musician comes in, tons of diverse people are abound doing something. One could attend a new event every day. In less developed Asian countries, street vendors chat away, day and night markets attract all kinds of people for a stroll, everyday life can be seen from the street. One witnesses the life of others everyday, and the heat lures people (or just me) to do more adventurous things.

Creativity, I imagine, is usually seen as an introversive process. One thinks of something new. But the process for me is based on experience, the distractions of the environment I live in. External stimuli is key.

The experiences (events, adventures) inspires me to create more adventures or challenges or work. Experiences inspire the creation of more experiences.

Back to the question. Why do I fail to have new experiences in the suburbs?

Well, what experiences do suburban people have? Consume media (alone and together). Potluck dinners. Family gatherings. Work (can be social).

I consider anything social as creative. Why didn't the social gatherings feel like significant experiences? I can't remember having many adventures in the suburbs.

Perhaps they [the social gatherings] just weren't enough, and I need more. A social gathering in a house is one experience, but there's more that can be experienced between. The commutes in cars are horrendously inefficient and dull. In Virginia Beach, one gets into their car, takes the same street to get to their destination. If the street is a highway, the most one can experience is a car accident or a funny license plate. In Tapei, a normal commute from my apartment often consists of: walking through an old neighborhood where people are doing laundry and washing dishes outside, a day market with fresh fruits and vegetables, pet stores with cute pets at the window and people interacting with them, on to a bicycle, through streets and alleys (with the ability to take new routes), dismount the bicycle, and walk to the destination.

Perhaps in addition to the lack of external stimuli, my personality is at fault. In the suburbs, life is almost entirely based on the experiences they have with the relationships they currently have. Furthermore, if one is Asian, then the relationships are likely not far from the family. It's healthy. Normal. I think. But I consider myself to have SPD [todo: link]. I love meeting people (probably for the experience) but have trouble maintaining relationships, eventually avoiding people altogether, forgetting how to talk. In a suburb, I turn to media for new experiences and continue to be lonely. In big cities and less developed Asian countries, during times I am less social or depressed, I am still able to have new experiences, and do not feel alone. I have the city. I have all the people outside.

I sit down at a food stall near my apartment after midnight. A Taiwanese couple in their forties offer me to sit with them. We introduce ourselves, talk a little, and eat. My heart is uplifted by the sympathy of this couple. I call a friend. I recover. I live on.

Such a situation would be harder to come by in the suburbs.

<blockquote>
10/6/14
It's because that's the only stimulus she has in the house. There is no one for her to talk to, no stimuli to respond to, and subsequently no creativity to make up for the lack of it.</blockquote>

If there are almost no new stimuli, it's possible for one to enter a completely routine life.

Perhaps this intensifies causation.

<blockquote>>9/3/13
Moving from the lively hostel I. [?] Seoul to the slow paced hostel in Busan, I remember how difficult it is to keep the pace of life I like -- the city pace.</blockquote>

A feeling one always gets moving from city to suburb. Impulsivity (pace) changes.



<blockquote>It feels like the first time I’m eating alone. I hate eating without a day's work.</blockquote>

Cities provide a feeling of being together, even if one personally is not.



<blockquote>9/13/13 in Busan, South Korea
Busan relaxed me. I began working on a game that, during many points in my travel, I did not feel had a great design. So, the suburbs are a good place to work, but its easy to work on something fruitless Its a waste of time. So is learning languages without practical use. Yeah, I'd rather live in a roller coaster pace, having moments of high design so that I don't fall into the comfort of working on something without design.</blockquote>

I felt there was nothing to do in the suburban town that I began making stuff, though, I simultaneously felt that it was a waste of time. It is an absurdity. Creating media does not directly affect people, so the reward is not offered until the product is complete and distributed. The feedback loop is too large to sustain constant motivation. I am too impatient.

Cities are more likely to make one more political. Take actions to directly affect people.

		<title>Prose is Superfluous: Active Communication through Play and Art</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Thesis</strong>
As one gets older, one cumulates concepts, only the content [in life and media] changes slightly, the content of target is often prose, which itself is often superfluous.

<strong>Learning</strong>
When learning a new [to the learner] concept, prose can be omitted. It is only there to communicate what's one knows to another person, or to validate it in writing. And even then, it's quite difficult. For example, as some professor said, try to explain a bike ride, physically. Everyone knows how bikes work: you pedal, the chain goes around the gears, which in turn turns wheels, but describing the mechanics precisely requires much effort and time. The force pressed down at a certain angle of the rider's foot results in a certain centrifugal force, blah blah blah.

People learn concepts quickly, sometimes instantly, through play [life], games, film, and whatever other new mediums.

If one knows how several concepts work, at least without the drudgery of standard notation, why slow children down by teaching them standard notation? If one removes writing, children would be able to grasp far more complex concepts. Then, when it comes time to actually write, that is, to prove a new concept or discovery, one may need to finally learn how to explain it through writing. Isn't this more practical, time-efficient, resulting in more exploration and discovery?

To conclude, the process of learning is backwards. Schools teach kids to learn a concept, then learn how to write it. The writing is superfluous, a hindrance, limiting. It can be skipped. Kids should learning, until there is reason to write.

Edit: A later thought. Writing is often used as a way to test the individual's knowledge. This is a good reason. But perhaps there should be a better way of testing then.

<strong>Art</strong>
There are many instances in art that I feel prose is superfluous. The medium of art should be chosen by the artist to best display their feeling. If the medium is not literature, then writing should likely be a very small part, if at all.

<strong>Literature</strong>
I've always had a problem with reading. I could talk about things I like, but otherwise, I'd dread reading. I consistently scored poorly in English classes. My dad embarrassingly, but now I feel with great care, bought me Hooked on Phonics. It didn't work.

Why would a 15 year old care about The Great Gatsby? As a 15 year old I didn't even understand the modern world, how could I grasp the 1920s? What's the point of all of that content, description. I'd rather have watched a film and take it all in within the time frame of a single class, instead of spending several weeks.

Perhaps it was because reading is a passive activity. Sure, reading and talking about it together in class helps, but it still didn't evoke much activity. Or, not enough to hold my attention.

It wasn't until I read Invisible Cities by Italo Calvino that I felt the amount of words used was not superfluous. Reading it felt great. I'd read a piece, think about it, perhaps create my own ideas, and be satisfied.

Literature should only have enough words [content] to convey an idea. Any more is superfluous.

<strong>Graphic Novels, Comics, and Photography</strong>
Graphic novels (and comics), the natural step up from literature, often convey meaning without prose. Sure, there's dialog, but in good graphic novels, imagery, sequence, and framing deliver meaning. Interpretation is to be made of framing and what happens between frames. If there's too much prose, then it might as well be literature. There is a clear distinction between the two.

I've only read a handful, but reading (looking at) Watchmen was an extremely contemplative experience. I was only able to read a chapter per session, sometimes only a few pages. It left so much to think about up to the reader, all of this, with little to no prose.

[I don't normally consume photography, but I felt it belongs in the same category.]

<strong>Film</strong>
The more films I watched, the less prose they had. They focused on the other aspects of film: cinematography -- imagery, screenplay -- sequence of images, body motion of actors; to express feeling and ideas. The film, that is, the video, is the the center of the medium, not the dialog.

Some of my favorite directors such as Hirokazu Koreeda, Tsai Ming-Liang, and Edward Yang use very little dialog. Without dialog, the viewer watches more intensely at the image and actions. It asks the viewer to be a little more active, to think, to reflect. Not of comprehension of the narrative of the film, but how one's own experiences and world views -- knowledge of psychology, economic systems, culture, human development -- interact with the film.

Usually if a narrator has to inform the viewer, it's a failure of the film. Hence my indifference toward most documentaries.

<strong>Game</strong>
Games usually don't have much prose. I currently can't think of many. JRPGs and film-like video games? Those are dated. Early use of video games.

Games, the most active form of the arts thus far mentioned, is a medium that has the ability to omit prose entirely. Playground games often don't have prose, only in its rules. Card games also don't have prose, just numbers and/or shapes; If the cards do contain text, it's often necessary to to the game -- a rule of the game. Think about this: Take any video game, strip it of it's prose, and it's very likely the game is still playable. It's just extraneous content. I remember as a child I'd continuously mash buttons through text because I knew it was unnecessary (and because the content sucked compared to the quality of literature). The method of communication of a game is play, not prose.

<strong>Conclusion</strong>
The method of communication of life is not prose, it's play. It's the sensory input and response stimuli, the interaction, the resulting affect it has on the mind. Prose cannot interact. Few prose are powerful enough to elicit response on the level of an interaction in real life. And even then, another medium likely could have been chosen to do the same thing in a more efficient manner. Prose is ancient. Passive mediums are old. Learning through prose is directional, but passive, uncreative, and inefficient (requiring skimming). The most practical and efficient use of prose is merely for reference, usually in the form of a Wikipedia article, or a quick Google search (a modern form of skimming).

This ends again with me in <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/nomadism-culture-and-the-playful-quest-for-knowledge" title="Nomadism, Culture, and The Playful Quest for Knowledge">thought of a more ideal method of living and learning</a>, without the boring, forgetful, superfluous, prose.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[[Old rambling draft, just posting.]

The posts I've written in the past few days (<a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/prose-is-superfluous-active-communication-through-play-and-art" title="Prose is Superfluous: Active Communication through Play and Art">Prose is Superfluous: Active Communication through Play and Art</a>, <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/taiwan-and-japan-active-and-passive-lifestyles" title="Taiwan and Japan: Active and Passive Lifestyles">Taiwan and Japan: Active and Passive Lifestyles</a>, <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/creativity-external-stimuli-cities-and-suburbs" title="Creativity, External Stimuli, Cities, and Suburbs">Creativity, External Stimuli, Cities, and Suburbs</a>, <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/lone-work-and-depression" title="Lone Work and Depression">Lone Work and Depression</a>, <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/nomadism-culture-and-the-playful-quest-for-knowledge" title="Nomadism, Culture, and The Playful Quest for Knowledge">Nomadism, Culture, and The Playful Quest for Knowledge</a>), I feel is a search for certain way of living and learning, more specifically, an ideal method of learning, the playful quest for knowledge.

What's actually needed?

A vocational school suffice for most positions in the developed world, including the the most revered professions.

From high school to the highest degree, what are people doing? What work is being done? What is being produced? What is learned? I don't understand. Other than top universities in research, arts, science, and philosophy, what are students doing in every other school? The answer probably is nothing. Or worse, being conditioned to do nothing.

It it possible to replace an entire curriculum with practical work, inside real workplaces? Would it be more inefficient than school? Wouldn't the motivation and reward of practical work be provide a better moral system than grades?

It seems the problem is merely a matter of placing people in the right places at the right time. Should that be left to agency, the inhuman game of sending resumes? I feel it critical to teach the child to take action to find work within their interests, or even to simply try something practical. Hopefully before then, they've learned how to learn other things, and use free time off of work to learn.

Thankfully, with the internet, it's become easier to meet the right people to do things of shared interest. If one lives in a city, just google nearby organizations, go to their organization, and talk to them. That's it.

I have no idea how the world of professional businesses have become so steeped in inhuman beliefs. Did media proliferate this?]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[[Old draft, posting anyway. I think at the time I was just too adhd to consume any long form media. Contrarily, I still feel books are quite a slow method of transmitting knowledge. I've now <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/a-liberal-arts-self-study-curriculum" title="A Liberal Arts Self Study Curriculum">fit books alongside more modern forms of media</a>.]

A continuation of the thoughts from <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/nomadism-culture-and-the-playful-quest-for-knowledge" title="Nomadism, Culture, and The Playful Quest for Knowledge"></a>

It's been a long time since I've explored via traditional media, as opposed to empiricism (travel travel travel, and interactive art!).

A certain Peter told me about http://www.thegreatcourses.com/ (piratebay has it).

I always feel that going through anything historical is a waste of time (adhd adhd adhd, and creativity!), but there's definitely some good things in there.

I enjoy the great ideas in philosophy lectures, which I apparently severely lack as a result of attending a non-liberal arts college. There's 60 of them. I especially liked these: Wittgenstein (soo goood, probably because most modern), Alan Turing, Aesthetics, Theory of Good Life, Descartes, and Newton. I've skimmed through most of the rest.

It's still a very passive thing, that requires a very passive time in life to actually listen to (programming indoors). You really have to select a narrow selection of interest to make any use of it. But it's far more thought-provoking than, say, music. And more concise than most books (even with the convenience of audiobooks -- I tried Guns, Germs, and Steel with interest and intent and still struggled), which allows more time to think. Still, it's not up to date with any modern theories; For that of course, there's Wikipedia (can transform text to audio!).

Which brings a question: If you work a lone job indoors, say an office environment, without cool people to be distracted by, what do you do with that free time, how and what do you explore? Or did you end up finding a creative outlet indoors?

tldr: books suck.

--

The conversation on Facebook that brought about this thought:

A person way smarter than me said:
History is one of the best fields to study if you want to figure out long-term 
trends in human consciousness. I would argue that history is very interesting, but has problems with presentation. Case in point, I used to not be at all interested in the time period between the industrial revolution in american history, but now see it as fundamental in establishing movements in the Christian right and eventually leading to the moral majority and ultimately Sarah Palin. (This is an idea that's far too big to contain here, obviously. I should probably write a book!) That's just one aspect of the cultural shift in America as well. When someone says they think history is boring, I believe they aren't reading it correctly, and are probably basing their opinion on the way history was taught to them, rather than how history actually is. 

Guns Germs and Steel's author has a long-winded style; he likes to cover all the bases, all the time. Don't judge non-fiction by that. 

Also, books are awesome. You engage differently when faced with long-form text than you do when you are listening. One isn't better than the other because they are different scales. 

I'd be interested in the "modern theories" you allude to that Wikipedia fulfills, but Hofstadter doesn't.


I naively replied:
So much to learn from Sir Ben.

It's probably my fault for failing to share my thoughts on reading, which even then should result in writing out thoughts. Perhaps it's because it's not as sensational as other media. It usually just feels goalless, where does reading huge texts lead to?

Oh god American history was always the least interesting of all histories to me, hah. Probably because it's span is short relative to other countries.

Hahahah The Formation of Sarah Palin. That would be one disgusting yet interesting book.

Guns, Germs, and Steel is quite alright, mostly because I'm really interested in it's huge scope of anthropology. I'll probably regain the interest when I'm interested in the subject again, or doing something related to it.

Listening vs reading. That'll require some research. 

I meant The Great Courses doesn't have much modern material, Hofstadter I haven't read yet. Modern theories, I guess I mean philosophy and research of life-related things: happiness, mental illness (and it's biology -- esp. dopamine-related ones), learning, playing, etc. Hence my recent urge for non-fiction books.

It just seems to be so much more fun and efficient exploring Wikipedia, and a more active (I have more choice than just skimming) way of learning, and finding interesting, specific subjects. I think it would be very easy to have a Wikipedia session on American History, hop around links, and figure out The Formation of Sarah Palin. All of that in a more efficient and fun manner than fat books in a library on American History.

THE INTERNETS!

...

I guess the target books are: non-narrative, non-fiction, broad in scope, like Guns.., Godel..., Thinking Fast and Slow, Antifragile, etc. Not the most playful things, haha.

		<title>Island Nations and Globalization</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This post along with several others including related posts, <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/creativity-external-stimuli-cities-and-suburbs" title="Creativity, External Stimuli, Cities, and Suburbs">Creativity, External Stimuli, Cities, and Suburbs</a> and <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/taiwan-and-japan-active-and-passive-lifestyles" title="Taiwan and Japan: Active and Passive Lifestyles">Taiwan and Japan: Active and Passive Lifestyles</a>, were all written during my 10 day visa run in Okinawa.

Okinawa, as I mentioned in past posts is a scary boring suburb. The streets are empty at all times of the day. Well, empty of pedestrians; There's tons of cars. Even the main street in it's largest city is empty. Lone business men dressed in high quality black sacks, black shoes, and an Hawaiian [flower patterned] shirt can be spotted in some neighborhoods with a bag from a nearby convenience store filled with individual sized food and drink. Nobody else is outside. Inside, people laze around passively consuming media on their computers and television. Instead of socializing, people stand outside and smoke. Everyone smokes.

Anyway, this post isn't about the current status of this place, or more ranting about suburbs, rather how it came to be, or, how I imagine it came to be, because that will lead to more broad answers. How did Okinawa turn into such a boring suburb? Or is it no different from any other suburb in Japan, and therefore not worth investigating?

Looking at the Wikipedia article, it was annexed during the Meiji Restoration, then the battle of Okinawa killed 1/4th, U.S. owned it in 1945 to 1962, which explains the vintage vibe of A&Ws and Blue Seal ice cream, then returned back to Japan.

Were Okinawans, with their own culture, whom refer themselves different from mainlanders much different? Were they far less developed than the mainland? One certainly gets the feeling that these people were farmers, but development turned them into office workers. Both jobs are mechanical, requiring human machines, the only difference is technology. One starts to wonder if Jared Diamond (of Guns, Germ, and Steel) was right. The only difference between the two [farmers and office workers, or Papuans and, well, the rest of the world] is technology, not intelligence. People are cultured to use the computer. With media, especially with popular television shows and manga, language can be learned passively.

As I watch people, I feel no difference from these people and those in far less developed countries. The people at this hostel in Okinawa work, walk, talk, smoke, and sleep no different than the people I encountered Laos. The Okinawans that work at my hostel cook simple foods, read manga all day, and sleep at any time of the day. The one's that I can visibly see working are drone office workers. The only difference between the two, it feels, is technology and money. In Okinawa, there are vending machines to replace humans, machines to count change in cash registers, machines at home to cook food, cars, a monorail, bland apartment buildings, and the normal things suburbs have. 

I feel the result modern Okinawa is attributed to the fact that it is an island. Islands are usually less developed since they don't attract as many intelligent people as mainlands -- a place with interconnected cities -- do. I imagine all island nations face this problem. Before the advent of budget flights or ferries, there wasn't easy access to move to an urban center.

But Okinawa has money, which is what makes it more perplexing. Did U.S. bases provide income? Did tourism? Why is the standard of living in Okinawa, a place with the highest amount of centurions (people aged over 100) in the world, so high? I feel that the latter is targeted toward less developed Okinawa. The ones that eat fish and tofu, and live the expected tropical life. Something that seems to exist only in imagination, my preconception of a tropical island. In reality, the entire island is developed, just as the entirety of Japan and Korea are. Rural areas still have convenient stores and modern facilities.

Perhaps some genetics are at play. Perhaps Okinawans are genetically diligent, non-hedonistic, stress-free, with high self-control (they invented Karate). The change in technology did not affect this, instead, they adapted. From diligent rice farmers to diligent office workers with nice cars, their attitude remain unaltered. Or perhaps those stats are for the older generation, and the next few generations will die younger.

I don't know where this post was going. Island Nations and Globalization? I guess I just find globalization overwhelming. It never makes sense to me. And island nations that globalize are even more mind-bottling because they often retain thousands years of culture and genetics (simply because it's surrounded by water), and then suddenly take in technology, without immigration or emigration of it's people or other peoples.

Okinawa must not have been sudden, as people handle technology extremely well. In Laos, I've seen plastic landfills. What would happen if you gave a Papuan a vending machine?

Thinking about the modernization of Okinawa is probably no different than thinking about the modernization Chinese cities right now: places that received a surplus of money in a short span of time, and the natural unfolding of what people do with it, and how the people adapt. It's non-sensical, unfair, scary, and utterly interesting.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>The Apex of Mania and Creativity in Taipei</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[[Old draft. Great for personal history. Guessed publishing date.]

During my time in Taipei the second time I experienced the apex of mania and creativity.

WORDPRESS WTF. See paragraph at end then come back.

I'd go to art venues, art events, see traditional neighborhoods, and generally be fascinated about people and culture: the old people near Longshan Temple, food cart vendors, kids dressed homogeneously, girls taking selfies, people selling betel nuts, people holding signs on the side of a road. I'd wonder what they were thinking about. I'd consume Humans of New York and Tsai-Ming Liang films. I wanted to stay on the streets. I became a person of the streets. My perspective altered (probably along with my perception on reality). I'd be disgusted by commercial streets and expensive tea NT$30 ($1) tea shops. I'd be disgusted at myself for buying a cup. During the day I'd take naps outside. Sometimes I'd skip taking a shower as I didn't want to miss class (and because the water would be cold at times).

At the cost of efficiency, I'd find ways to make work more sociable. Instead of using the internet to find an apartment, I'd physically walk around a neighborhood I liked, look for red "for rent" signs, and call people. I'd then use the Taiwanese website to find rooms, which was in Chinese. I maximized Chinese learning by making my life more adventurous.

At first If found class useless. Why would anyone need it? It didn't make sense. During the 20 minute commute to class I could read and listen to a chapter, while listening in on  real conversations and looking at Chinese signs all around.

I focused entirely on dialogue. I bought a cheap radio and listened to it when I wasn't talking to people, actually listening to it. I'd use a smartphone application to find words. If I ever was indoors, it would be at the hostel with a TV on with subtitles on, focusing on the dialog and Chinese characters.

I listened well. I spoke well. But I think the learning was impaired. There was little to no scaffolding in my personal study. That is where class supported me. And although the class was slow, inhibiting my urge to talk, I failed to write Chinese. I came to the conclusion that it was useless to write. Recognizing Chinese character is enough, I thought. But using good students a model, I found that despite my high-consumption life, good students performed better. I gained more vocabulary, but my grammar was scattered. I should have read more of the book instead of using an application for grammar words.

After some time, I started Humans of Taipei. It coincided with my goal to learn mandarin, my fascination for people, and extreme response to external stimuli. I did it all in an extremely anxious pace, resulting in somewhat poor results.

After a month and a half, I struggled to keep the pace, and winter weather came closer. Then, suddenly, the sun disappeared completely behind a permanent haze. I couldn't handle the sudden change. I reacted by sleeping. Hibernating. For a week. At some point I bought ticket to India, which had warmer temperature and more sunlight. I escaped a week later.



Goal:
Mania provides a ton of creativity, but the goal should be to leverage it as a tool to provide ideas, then control it to do the work. Continue this cycle.

And, during my travels, this is exactly what I did. I worked in cycles. If there wasn't a product in two weeks, I'd move on. I'd enter a new city or town, wander, figure out something to do within the mania, then put all of effort in executing it. Sometimes it's successful, other times it wasn't -- I'd work too inconsistently or I'd have another idea and think the old one is inferior.

I was already enrolled in Mandarin class. After class, I'd explore Taipei with high anxiety wanted to do something but never wanting to settle on one.


--
second paragraph:
I had come enrolled to Mandarin class. After class, I'd explore Taipei with high anxiety, simultaneously wanted to seek out fine art, jobs, and possibly teach. Instead of working, I spent every day outside for as long as possible, finding ways to socialize with people, as my goal was to learn Mandarin.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Thought of after reading Mother Teresa in Okinawa.

It's quite clear to see in my life that there are two phases: hypomania and overly rational.

One, is the frequently mentioned <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/hypomania" title="Hypomania">hypomanic</a> stage, which is highly emotional, instinctive, fast, consuming lots, intense eternal stimuli.

In this phase real life is satisfying enough. External stimuli more than satisfies my satisfies my emotions, causing hypomania.

The second is slow, little to no emotion, external stimuli has been conditioned and adapted to, loss in relationships, loss in a creative life (creative not in terms of work, but in terms of thoughts and designs), being able to focus on very narrow things like programming, work, high art media that requires much critical thinking.

This in phase I watch a few films per week to satisfy my thirst for emotional content.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The times I felt <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/hypomania">hypomanic</a>, I felt these were some of my most creative times in my life.

Creativity and productivity are separate. Creativity is the process of creating ideas. Productivity is implementing them.

During mania, I am so creative (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_psychiatry#Flight_of_ideas">flight of ideas</a>) that I continue consuming (sensually) and creating new ideas. The problem is that I never want to settle one. How does one choose one to work on? How can any work be worth the time? As a person with a limited lifetime, wouldn't it be <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/constant-art-ethics" title="Constant Art Ethics">efficient to only work on things with high effect low work ratio</a>?

At this time I felt that even spending time to implement art onto a medium was a waste of time. Isn't performance better, netting a direct result?

My work moved from medium to direct interaction, experiences. It supplied faster feedback, which was crucial as I worked alone. <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/creativity-as-organization-from-chaos" title="Creativity as Organization from Chaos">Travel is the best way to consume the most amount of information, and a constant stream of performance-oriented events seemed the ideal way to create something based on that information</a>. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/TaiwanesePeople">Humans of Taipei</a> and Vincent Moon documentary-like videos.

Perhaps that's true, but during the time, I forget, all information is not useful. And even good performances and documentation require some work, though, less than it used to.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>My Creative Process, Honing Theory, and Nomadism</title>
		<link>http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/my-creative-process-honing-theory-and-nomadism</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Creativity, as I mentioned in a past post (todo: link to Hypomania and Creativity), is linked to dopamine, and greatly enhanced during hypomania. This post's content is similar to a past general empirical post, <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/the-life-of-a-nomadic-schizoid" title="The Life of a Nomadic Schizoid">The Life of a Nomadic Schizoid</a>, but focuses on the creative process.

Of the theories found on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creativity#Theories_of_creative_processes">Wikipedia article for creativity</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creativity#Honing_theory">Honing Theory</a> seems to be most modern, complex, and the one that best fits to my creative process during my travels.

Let's walk through a single phase of hypomania and creativity.

<blockquote>"Honing theory posits that creativity arises due to the self-organizing, self-mending nature of a worldview ..."</blockquote>

When I travel to a new place, especially from a place with low external stimuli (Japan, suburbs) to a place with high external stimuli (Taiwan, cities) I often go through a hypomanic episode. During this time, everything externally visible is intense, aching inquiry -- people, language, culture, objects, all of the humanities are at question. My mind has to re-organize everything. I use all of my free time exploring manically, until, eventually becoming familiar with the setting, and stop inquiring.

<blockquote>"... and that it is by way of the creative process the individual hones (and re-hones) an integrated worldview."</blockquote>

During this time my values are volatile; It depends entirely on what I consumed recently, and the intensity of it. Perhaps I focus on the poorest of people with intense emotional attachment (artisans in Malaysia [<a href="https://vimeo.com/55547982">Roti Delivery</a>], slums and servants in India, prostitutes in Southeast Asia, tribal peoples in Laos, Tsai Ming Liang, Kim Ki Duk), wanting to do something with them, despising any higher class. Perhaps I'm deeply curious about what other people are thinking; How or why they do the things that they do -- culture and sociology (in addition to the poor peoples, the public of Taipei [<a href="https://www.facebook.com/TaiwanesePeople">Humans of Taipei</a>], Humans of New York, Vincent Moon). Perhaps I'm confident, competitive, with extreme high art ideas, and do not wish to lower my standards, like (no particular subject is of inspiration, it's just crazy associations of previous knowledge [<a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/pinkies-up" title="Pinkies Up">Pokemon Snap</a>, <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/playground-maker-the-world-is-now-a-playground" title="Playground Maker: The world is now a playground">Playground Maker</a>), fine art exhibitions, Banksy, Nam Jun Paik].

<blockquote>Other experiments show that different works by the same creator exhibit a recognizable style or 'voice', and that this same recognizable quality even comes through in different creative outlets. [similar to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auteur_theory">Auteur Theory</a>]</blockquote>

Whatever the idea it is, they retain the same characteristics: social realism, playfulness, experience, and public settings.

<blockquote>"The conception of the task changes through interaction with the worldview, and the worldview changes through interaction with the task."</blockquote>

Committing to an idea, doing the work, and completing it, is the difficult part because while working my values change and I re-evaluate my work; I want to do something new, or, I care for something else more. Why make a game when there's a slum nearby? Why take pictures of people, when I could work at a NGO?

It's quite difficult finding the balance to complete long form works -- to stay in one place, work regularly. It requires creating a positive working environment, which reinforces my initial values, so that I don't chase differently valued idea. I need to share my idea with everyone around me, so that people support me, providing social feedback, until the work is complete.

But I'm straying away from the subject: the creative process -- not work.

Nearly every time I move, I have to explore, find something to do, and do it. Taking in the world and making out something concrete.

Moving, physically changing the world, is not required to changed one's worldview. Some life experience, especially serious, could do it. Media at times imparts so much power that one's worldview is changed, as mine is at the end of many films. Perhaps LSD trips are similar to hypomania in a new country. For me, moving, traveling, above media and life, has been the most potent method.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Learning via Empericism</title>
		<link>http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/learning-via-empericism</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Note: This post is just a flow of thoughts. Need to structure it and separate into different blog posts.

I've learned most of the things I know through empiricism. If not, through film.

While listening to The Great Courses, I've learned that philosophy can be gained from several sources: arts (dance, drama, etc.), dialogs, literature, history, and that's where I stopped the lecture.

I stopped it because my brain wanted to create. Talk back to it. Write something about it. Blog it. It seems My short attention span gained while living in cities leads to far more creativity than consumption.

Back to that single line from the lecture, whether one learns from a performance or interview by George Carlin (art and dialog), a game or lecture by Jonathan Blow (art and dialog), or from their mother (conversation). The lessons are universal; It's philosophy. People learn (philosophy) by living. Consuming. I imagine one could learn a lot by simply reading The Illiad. Perhaps The Illiad alone covers 90% of all popular media.

But what if the person does not find literature sensational enough? Then one turns to film. But what if one doesn't find film sensational enough? Then one turns to life. Travel. Go to different places. Meet people. Do different jobs. Empiricism.

I think it's a problem for people, especially creative types, schizotypes, ones with ADHD or similar dopamine related problems. Traditional education is not engaging enough. One is likely to quite school early. Media is not enough; It's too passive. One can consume media simultaneously living a life: walking, talking, working, consuming and interacting locally. One moves to the city, where more people feel this way, have more events, social gatherings, social interaction.

But how much is really learned from empiricism (todo: link to optimal learning life)? What is really gained from empiricism that books cannot give?

Perhaps it's just the perception of a person with too much dopamine, that one is less receptive to knowledge from passive mediums and traditional education, where there is not enough sensation.

But if the environment of instruction is too constraining, not allowing enough critical thinking, then perhaps it isn't, and it is at fault. Compared to traditional education, empiricism is more creative and fun, but uneven and inefficient. In traditional education everyone is learned the same things in a rather similar fashion, unless one's teachers and peers were great, which is based on where your parents were born, which is based on chance. But what about with a more empirical life, one chooses what to learn, which itself seems a little hedonistic. If one chooses to quit school and pursue something, with sheer motivation, isn't that a better choice?

Back to the question, what is learned from empiricism that books cannot?

The only difference is that, in empiricism, one has an actual sensory experience linked to it. Which again, in creative people would trigger some emotion, which I think is important in motivation, which leads to more thoughts and contemplation.

If I had not travelled to tribal areas, would I have ever thought so deeply about them, to urge me to read Guns, Germs, and Steel? If Jared Diamond didn't go to Papua New Guinea where that Papuan did not ask him why Papuans did not gain cargo, and instead read it in a book, would it have had the same effect, leading to writing a giant book about it? Perhaps if some sort of media came across about tribal areas, would it have created an equally deep effect, to cause us to do something?

Which direction is better? Experience then research, because the motivation of the experience drives it. Or research then experience, to prove it?

To me, an emotional person, experience then research. I imagine most art goes in this direction too: an experience becomes inscribed to a medium. But to a less emotional person, the other way around.

Imannual Kant would be a good example for the other way. He never left 10 miles from his home. He was able to write papers that reached far out to natural history and space. In his Critique of Pure Reason, he's argues synthetic knowledge a priori truths, having concepts of things without empirical knowledge. He dug deep into philosophy, deeper than many ever have, probably because he did live a blunt, undistracted life. His drive is usually led from the writings of others, in this case, Hume's skepticism of Hume's empiricism.

A similar case with Stephen Hawkings, a person with motor handicaps who wrote theories and books about space.

I feel empiricism leads to breadth instead of depth. Interdisciplinary thinking. But it requires great control and some time digging deep, to produce anything useful from it.

Why is empiricism linked to hedonism? Why do creatives go to cities, where hippies become hipsters, and lose those values they had before they went in?

It must be a lack of self-control in consumption, and living in a city, where capitalism is at large, can be difficult to ignore.

Travel also costs money. But it doesn't cost money to walk, bicycle, and it's quite cheap to travel by bus, far better than single passenger cars. With budget flights, empiricism has become quite affordable.

I feel I've learned a lot by living in a simple apartment in New York walking the streets, attending free events from higher education and art events from great artists.

Is it better to be hipster (a hippie who lives in the city) than a hippie? Isn't the experience gained from living in a village in China greater than the experience than eating dumpling in Chinatown? What do cities have that the world does not?

Smart people.

Even if one had all the money to travel the world, one still has that essential human need of social interaction. Not through books, but through talking, performances, and events. Learning through people, as opposed to books.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Building up on past posts  (<a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/island-nations-and-globalization" title="Island Nations and Globalization">Island Nations and Globalization</a>, <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/taiwan-and-japan-active-and-passive-lifestyles" title="Taiwan and Japan: Active and Passive Lifestyles">Taiwan and Japan: Active and Passive Lifestyles</a>, <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/creativity-external-stimuli-cities-and-suburbs" title="Creativity, External Stimuli, Cities, and Suburbs">Creativity, External Stimuli, Cities, and Suburbs</a>) about my time in Okinawa, I feel that the inhabitants of Okinawa, in addition to living an extremely suburban lifestyle, are very cold.

There were several instances during my trip I experienced this.

On my first day, I had to find a hostel that had rooms and was cheap. I starred three on Google Maps and went to the closest one to the metro station. No one was at the desk. When one came, I talked, found out they didn't have dormitories, then ask for other hostels, she said she doesn't know any others. (pause). The next hostel I went to, a girl opened a door slightly, said it was full, and nearly closed it, as if it were a mean person's house. I was able to talk into using their wifi for a moment while I called a few hostels, although she seemed quite angry. The final hostel, the one I ended up staying in, again had no one at the reception. Once he came, I was able to get a room, but that was it. No greeting, no tour of the hostel's facilities, or anything.

During my stay at the hostel, there was never an instance where I was asked if I needed anything. When I asked about touristy things, like ferry schedules, bus numbers, snorkel locations, things to do, things to eat, they all say they don't know. The staff eat and live at the hostel eat together, watch TV and smoke, all day, all done separately from customers.

Luckily, there were a few people at the hostel of exception; One worker and her boyfriend were more hippie -- they had a little more energy. There were also two other foreigners, and Aussie and Englishman, both with tens times more energy than any Okinawan. The Australian girl continued in her own world, and told me she didn't understand what the people at the hostel ever did -- are they workers, do they have other work, or do they just watch TV and read manga all day? She didn't care much though; she just loves snorkeling. The English guy learned Japanese out of the country for several years, and now lives between Osaka and Kyoto. He's somehow able to talk to us and be similarly energetic, yet act completely Japanese at other times, smoking outside, and not talking to anyone. I was able to have few meals with these four people.

During my stay in Naha in general, there was little to no interaction with everyone. Shopkeepers mechanically sell goods for their company. When I ask people on the street for directions, some point a direction, some say they don't know, and some don't respond at all. I don't think it's a language barrier problem either because many surprisingly respond in English, and if not, they understand when I say "marketto wa doko deska?". Otherwise, the streets are quite bare, and the people just weren't interesting enough for me to want to engage in conversation. Looking at the way others interact, I believe it's the least social place I've encountered. People just don't chat with people they don't know. There were few people walking alongside another person. Everyone walked alone, without headphones or a cell phone. Just walking robotically toward wherever they needed to go. It's rare to encounter any social activity outside of a house, bar, or family restaurant. This aspect is most frightening to me, and brings about the whole dystopian human robot future, with an average of two vending machines and one other kind of machine per block.

Today:
I wanted to go snorkeling. I of course had to plan everything because the staff did not know. I took a nearly empty bus full of people who clearly did not want to socialize. I arrived at a snorkel spot and only had goggles, not the snorkel. So, I asked people if I could rent or buy one. The first shop, which provides tours for snorkeling and scuba diving and had two tub full of fresh snorkels said no. Not even for two hours. The second shop also said no, because they were closing in an hour and a half. They only allowed renting, not buying (the rental price equivalent to the buying price). They also mentioned that the snorkel spot was closed -- I won't delve into to the East Asian safety culture observation. I was a little flustered, and said "This is crazy!". To which one of the guys, who spoke English quite well, replied "This is Japan!". I'm not sure what the meaning behind that was. It seems he acknowledged some cultural differences. Did he mean Japan is law-abiding, overly-safe, unhelpful people? How can one acknowledge their own culture's characteristics and act according to it?

At the beach next to the closed cape, two tour guided groups snorkel in shallow waters in full wet suits. Oh right, no safety talk.

After snorkeling a bit, I walked back toward the main road, one of the shop workers that denied me of a snorkel stood outside, now with two others beside him, eager to chat. I gave the normal travel chat. They asked how I was going to get back. I said hitchhike, if not, the bus. They thought I was cool and also thought hitchhiking is possible. No help, but at least an interest. They informed me that it was illegal to hitchhike.

A good test of hospitality is the amount of time it takes to hitchhike. Taiwan took about 5 cars. Okinawa took 3 hours, and when I mentioned I wanted to go to Naha, the young guy nearly drove off. I had to stop him to ask him to take me however far he was going in the same direction. I spotted a bus stop and told him to stop me there. The thought taking me in the same direction or finding a bus stop did not cross his mind.

I took a bus back. This time the people were sleeping, perhaps tired from work. I didn't have quite enough cash. I knew, but I wanted to test their hospitality further. The bus driver said it was okay. Finally. One hospitable moment.

On the way back to the hostel, I stopped by a supermarket, bought some meat (using credit card), took it to the hostel, cooked it, ate it, all alone. Alone, alongside two other people eating individual portioned food from convenient stores.
--

In Tokyo, I also wasn't able to, or often, just did not want to engage in conversation with many Japanese people, probably because they all seem disinterested, in everything, including people. Perhaps this applies to all of Japan, but even more so to the suburbs of it, including Okinawa.

As a person who's recently lived in one of social countries in Asia (Taiwan) I am perhaps more frightened. The Australian girl who was from the suburbs managed well with having fun alone, then Facebooking and blogging at night. In contrast, I've been dying of social outlet, hence the mass amount of writing during my stay here. In Taiwan, I didn't write anything, because I was able to let my thoughts out by talking, socializing. I couldn't live here. No social person could. It's inhospitable to most, except for a few others who live a similar culture.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[[Old draft. Publishing anyway. Needs more work.]

Non-physical -- media.

Physical and alone. Another technique to extend hypomania, and creativity, is to continually create new experiences. One way is to change work places, to change external stimuli. A new park, cafe, shared workspace, street, protest, train, wherever.

Physical and social. A better method is to create new social experiences. Cook dinner for friends, have picnic at a park, play a game, talk, discuss, do something with other people.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[[Old draft. Did not finish, but just posting anyway.]

Exercise! It's kind of needed. But it doesn't have to be routine, or boring.

In college, I started with P90X. It provided an all around good balance of Anaerobic exercises, but it was too slow. I normally like to just release all of my energy, then go back to work. Perhaps I was working too hard back then. I then used Insanity. With more plyometrics I was able to tire myself quicker. It also used my own routine's order: quick cardio to tire self (warm up), workout, minimal cool down. After completing both, I usually combined the two, and just did whatever exercises depending on which body part was not tired.

Sometimes I'd just have a lot of energy, especially after over-sleeping on a Friday or Saturday night after a work week. I love biking. I can bike forever. Especially through cities. Exploring and biking. Running works too, but it's not nearly as fun, and it's just not good for the knees.

Of course there are more creative forms of exercise; The past exercises were because I had sedentary jobs.

Mixed martial arts is appealing. But it seems to require much time and effort going to a teacher 'n all, so I never bothered. I do however incorporate kicks and punches in my routine. Some kind of shadowboxing. Besides, nobody fights anymore. And going to a teacher is not very creative.

In comes two non-fighting exercises: dancing (freestyle breakdancing) and parkour. Both of which I'd consider arts. Dancing, usually, interacts less with environment than parkour, therefore I find less interesting. There's a lot to explore in dancing, but it's usually more with the body and floor (if alone). Dancing as an art, as opposed to exercise, is quite different. Parkour, however, is creative , explorative, and always offers exercise.

Instead of exercising in a room in front of a monitor or fitness instructor, you explore an environment, figure out the most efficient way to get from point A to point B, or the most stylish way (Freerunning), whichever.

I feel that it's a natural extension of my childhood. I used to jump off swings, jump over ditches and fences, bike, run, dive, do whatever was needed to not get tagged. It was fun. Parkour is just an adult version of those playground games I used to play, now with a name.

todo: further thinking
How can exercise positively affect the world?
  - generate power, social / community, teach discipline, public bicycles (replaces wasteful transportation)
--
p90x
All around a great workout. It focuses on a seperate group of muscles for each routine, spreading the workload out over a course of a week. It contains yoga, cardio, weight lifting, etc.

Insanity
This is far more focused on cardio and plyometrics, break your knee shit.

I'd recommend buying p90x and trying Insanity (borrow from a friend). There's some ideas I like in Insanity. I like that you don't start out with stretches, instead you start with a burst of cardio, stretch, then work out. I also like that Insanity encourages you to only take a minimal break (a few seconds) then get right back into the rigorous routine. This helps me push myself.

I was able to get through p90x without prior workout fairly easily, only slowing down on certain workouts (arms). I had to take a few second breaks every now and then in Insanity.

Prior to both workouts, I did my own elementary P.E. exercises and either ran or biked around the city. I've always had a small, thin build, but able to do perform well athletically.

		<title>Lateral Thinking, External Stimuli, and Self-Control</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[[Old draft. I don't think I got to the self-control part. It's closely related to <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/creativity-external-stimuli-cities-and-suburbs" title="Creativity, External Stimuli, Cities, and Suburbs">Creativity, External Stimuli, Cities, and Suburbs</a>.]

A thought from Ben's post, and my stay at Simon's house.

Ben said that I felt Wikipedia helps <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lateral_thinking">lateral thinking</a> (probably link from passive media post), which is helpful with creativity.

Later I moved to a friend's house, in a city, but in the 14th floor of an apartment, and working in an office. There was little to no external stimuli going on. Or, my receptiveness was low to the external stimuli. Boredom has ensued.

If one consumes what they want to consume, that is, what they probably know, what comes out of it?

In a suburb what new can someone consume? Only media is new. Books, films, and now, the internet. If one interacts solely digitally for new interactions, new inquiries, where does this life lead? Does one become more inclined to do digital things? A reduction in real interaction? Is this where cities and Taipei win?

The culture of the suburbs does not provide as much external stimuli, distractions, narrowing thought, creating more focus at the cost of creativity. To me, it's more ideal to live in a distracting city, and leave it up to me to make sense of it, trap myself in a room, and make something. It's Veidt vs Rorshach. Rorshach's method is direct, empericial, in the perspective of the lowest of men. In the physical world of distraction he creates his own method of solving problems, without self control. Veidt gains distraction through the form of 12 TVs. And through it he finds links, without the distraction of emotion, and creates a more rational solution, lateral thinking with self-control. Perhaps that's what it comes down to: I'm too emotional; I need cities to drive me. I have no self-control.

At the height of my hypomania and creativity, I stayed outside as much as I could, with people. Consuming everything.

Now at my lowest, I am consuming nothing. Not making decisions at every second. Mindlessly doing things.

I believe, it's the lack of external stimuli.

Throughout my travels, I never stayed out far from people. Cities, towns. I can't hike for longer than a few hours. The external stimuli disappears, then no thoughts comes to mind. I'm just hiking or biking or whatever. No reason. Perhaps I daydream. Whatever it is, there's no direction, I lose interest, I go back to civilization.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Philosophy from Media versus Life; New York versus the World</title>
		<link>http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/philosophy-from-media-versus-life-new-york-versus-the-world</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Is New York the best place to struggle because people are constantly on the verge of being broke, forced to make every hour count?

I just watched The Lego Movie, and it reminds me of what scares me most about my impending return to New York, and more general, America: media.

The film is entirely hypocritical. The underlying themes are creativity and capitalism, yet itself contradicts both. The hypocrisy in capitalism: film is produced is based on a product [Lego], produced by Warner Bros., casted with Hollywood icons, and filled with pop-culture references. The hypocrisy in creativity: The film is a series of tropes. It's Wall-E without the originality or creativity, which made Wall-E universally appreciated.

Why did I watch it? Because a great friend whipped it out on a laptop and I had time. Is that a good enough reason to? Shouldn't I instead have said, "No! It's a going to be terrible Hollywood film which won't lead to any good inquiry."? I'm in a rather passive mode now, and at that time I was quite happy, willing to have some fun.

Surprisingly, it did hark some questions. Awful things sometimes do that. It made me wonder how much knowledge I gained from media during my high school and college years, as opposed to knowledge from real experience. Are the two different? Is it okay to be de-sensitized of one or the other?

Perhaps it's okay for children to eat up as much media possible, as it's more accessible knowledge. Let those kids eat up every bit of [good] media imaginable. It's a time of learning. I feel that I learned so much from those great films I that became accessible once Netflix came out.

Does America consume more media than the rest of the world? Especially compared to social nations such as those in South East Asia and Taiwan?

I've recently been struggling from going from experiencing life to experiencing media. Hating it. Finding programming lifeless, unsocial, neither fun nor insightful, trying to use media while programming to make it more fun, failing. Furthermore poor media is failing too. Any form of passive art is failing to entice me.

If one consumes media as opposed to life, one's own art reflects it. Experiencing the Lego movie is unsettling from a Taiwanese person's standpoint, or anyone not exposed to much American media. There's simply too many pop-culture references. I usually associate pop-culture referencing to America. For example, Das Racist, although I really enjoyed while I was in New York, is an example of abusing pop culture referencing.

If one wants to make art, shouldn't one just live in a place that offers more life experience, a place with real life distractions?

In an older post I asked, How do people gain knowledge in an office environment? Is it all lifeless decisions, music-trance work?

Lastly, what does New York offer that the world does not? Creative people that have fun while creating, that socialize, experience, design during the day and work at night. I believe, New York, will provide the most diverse people, and therefore more diverse projects.

But every city is linked to wealth.

Why don't I feel the same way in Taipei? Or anywhere else? I never encountered as many great, crazy, hypomanic, creative, fun minds as I did in New York, and that's what gives me energy -- those extroverted (or introverted with extrovert characteristics) people. The energy they exude, through events, art, and conversation.

What's the way out? Business! A hostel, cafe, farm, real estate, whatever. Business for money and art for art. It's stupid to mix the two.

So, is living in a place with a great amount of external stimuli  such as Asia enough? Or should one live in a city, in a cheap place (ethnic enclave), and take advantage of the proximity of talent, yet try to live a simple life?

Perhaps the answer after all is business. First, get the money, to provide for a family, then create great art, as art is higher on the hierarchy of needs.

All one needs is a few good relationships, creative ones, and both would work.

And the failure of the suburbs is that people forget to experience. Art as experience. As I program more, I forget to listen to lectures, think, talk, work in new areas, philosophy. Life passes.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[note: I'm just starting this! Hold on.

I've been admitted to Parson's The New School for Design's Design and Technology program.

And I feel it is important to think about the following:

1. What do you want to do at Parson’s? (see my statement of interests and intentions I sent to Parson's, NYU game design, and NYU ITP)
  - write ideas, clearly, with purpose, and prioritize them to find the most meaningful one
  - propose (idea or ideas?) to audience at Parson’s once I get there

2. Summarize what experiences imparted some philosophy in games
  - <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/a-sequential-list-of-times-game-related-experiences-that-affected-me" title="A Sequential List of Times Game-related Experiences that Affected Me">list games and experiences</a>
  - create own manifesto
  - see philosophy's of great game designers
  - see old notes and thoughts I wrote

Life related questions:
3. Is attending Parson's necessary? Is being in New York necessary? Can I do this on my own outside of a city? Should the money go into business instead? Can $18,000 buy a tea shop in Taiwan? Can I live without much social life?]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[[Could use more work!]

Why do I love Tsai Ming Liang's films? 

In answering this, I believe I can find what characteristics of aesthetics I personally love.

Because his work is told from a view of a person from the street, a person who has no culture. The perspectives of the lives in his films are rarely shown, especially for such lengths of time. When i am in a state of hypomania, I think about the poor, how they relate to the world, and what they do. When I go to another country there is a layer of alienation brought out by culture: the temples, prayers, customs , food, tv. Culture itself is alien to humans, it's acquired; I always question how it came to be. How did the world come to the way it is. Lines of large apartment buildings in China, hours of commute time, betel nut stands, shopping malls, everything. When travelling through diverse areas, from indigenous to city, I keep questioning these things. In Tsai Ming Liang's films, I feel I am similarly always questioning. Given a slow pace, the low class humans in society, devoid of culture, almost devoid of life, one gets a fresh travelers perspective again. How did the world come to be? What are people doing, and why?

Few films bring about these questions.

During highly active times of travel, including hypomanic times of being entirely irrational, I couldn't stand any form of media because most films assume so much: film cliches, genres, reason films are made, and the most assumed of all: culture. Compared to going outside and actively doing something, only Tsai Ming-Liang was watchable.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[From Conciseness in Art [link]:
<blockquote>In single chapter of Invisible Cities by Italo Calvino, I feel satisfied. I consumed enough to trigger my brain to begin contemplating, creating, mixing in with my own thoughts. The power of literature is not in detail, but in imagination.

If imagination is not the goal, I still feel conciseness is powerful. In Francis Bacon's Essays, more about ethics is told in few words. Likewise in Borjes's Ficciones, the stories are told only to display its mechanics. (Although, there is and I dislike the large amount of references)</blockquote>

Films replaced most of literature. Though, they are different experiences.

I wonder, what's left of literature? And by literature, I mean fiction.

It seems the only pieces of literature I have are those that are fantastic, thought-provoking, and perhaps philosophic.

I guess I will have to wait until I finish a Tolstoy novel.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[[Old draft, nowhere near finished, publishing anyway.]

I've recently changed from an extrovert phase to an introvert one, and I'd like to explore the differences in how one interacts (and learns) for extroverts and introverts.

[stopped post here, poop. I gave it a shot.]

<blockquote>
from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personality_type#Attitudes:_extraversion_and_Introversion:
People who prefer extraversion draw energy from action: they tend to act, then reflect, then act further. If they are inactive, their motivation tends to decline. To rebuild their energy, extraverts need breaks from time spent in reflection. Conversely, those who prefer introversion expend energy through action: they prefer to reflect, then act, then reflect again. To rebuild their energy, introverts need quiet time alone, away from activity.

The extravert's flow is directed outward toward people and objects, and the introvert's is directed inward toward concepts and ideas. Contrasting characteristics between extraverts and introverts include the following:

Extraverts are action oriented, while introverts are thought oriented.
Extraverts seek breadth of knowledge and influence, while introverts seek depth of knowledge and influence.
Extraverts often prefer more frequent interaction, while introverts prefer more substantial interaction.
Extraverts recharge and get their energy from spending time with people, while introverts recharge and get their energy from spending time alone.</blockquote>

Hmm, well that seems to cover the basis of it.

<blockquote>Extraverts recharge and get their energy from spending time with people</blockquote>
I normally view thought as inaction and talking to people as action. But both can be either passively (lazily) done or actively done. Though, to me, it feels quite contradictory that talking to something is a passive thing. Or, perhaps, I don't know how to talk to people passively, and am always overly-excited like Socrates, inquiring instead of casually talking, wanting every social interaction a progressive one for me.

Therefore, I also often feel <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/books-passive-media-and-the-internet" title="Books, Passive Media, and The Internet">books are passive</a> and dialog is active.

How people critically think are from two modes: introspection and dialog.

A balance of the two is healthy, but I often fall to the extremes of either.

<blockquote>Extraverts are action oriented, while introverts are thought oriented.</blockquote>

This seems to go along the <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/two-phases-in-life" title="Two Phases in Life">two phases of life</a>.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[After a very active traveling life, I took a programming contract that altered me into a more passive person, or, active, but with non-humans. When I finished, I went to a nearby popular 24-hour bookstore a few times.

I was reading western philosophy at 3am, when, suddenly, I hear odd shrieks and thumping sounds, clearly a person suffering.

I go up to the person, find a bum shaking on the floor. I tell one person to call the cops (I'm in Taiwan, and that's when I realized I didn't know Taiwan's emergency number). Soon, the bum started bleeding from the mouth, so I told the other person to help me get the bum to sit against the wall, so the person wouldn't choke on his own blood. I was quite unsure what to do next. I froze a bit, then decided to search for anyone who seemed knowledgeable. As soon as I made that decision, finally, a person voluntarily came to help, a store employee, examined the bums mouth, figured the bum just bit his tongue, ingeniously stuck a pen between his teeth. A little later, the medics came (Taiwan's emergency services is are amazing).

It terrible that I did not know how to further handle the situation, other then getting others to help, but it is more terrible that only one other person helped.

Out of the 20 or so people in that bookstore within audible distance, only one came on time, one came late, just before the medics did, and throughout the rest of the time, no one even came to see what was going on.

It was frightening. Not the bum bleeding, but the lack of action. Immediately, I felt reading was absolutely actionless [todo: link to post] and hoped to never do work that makes me passive again, afraid I would turn into one of those 20 or so people.

This is simply an instance of the bystander effect [link to wiki], which is even more plentiful in the suburbs with car accidents, but the time of it, with me going from an active to passive phase, made the situation highly contemplative.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[隨機字條：因為寫不是創造的，我也會第一次用中文寫什麼都東西。

兩個月以前我開始設計程式的合同。那時候跟一點以前我做者聽哲學（Great Ideas of Philosophy, 2nd Edition by The Great Courses)。對我說來，我覺得有興趣。我天天聽了很少，只有一到二個演講，我覺得那多少夠了，對我想出來比較多。到那時候我不知道哲學是什麼。只有什麼東西有的學生學。

高中學校以來我總是寫我想出來什麼。我寫了什麼都東西。我感覺我寫了什麼是哲學的調查。

工作的時候我從好動改變消極，合理，不著經歷，沒經歷。所以我決定了我應該寫我知道什麼都。

可是我回來臺北的時候我馬上去附近的書店看哲學的書飯寫。我讀了「西方的哲學」被Bertrand Russell，一點讀別的書，讀Wikipedia。我覺得哲學的歷史很有興趣，尤其很少人好像我：Ludwig Wittgenstein，Francis Bacon，Søren Aabye Kierkegaard，可能John Dewey。

可是我覺得我讀了因為我現在比較懶。我感覺不見哲學對人比較好，理由好像理由我覺得不見藝術比較對人好：如果我讀別的人的書，我的心地好可能狹窄。所以我決定了我得聽讀書，只用我自己的字條寫。寫我怎麼了解什麼都東西。]]></content:encoded>

<a href="#Personal-History">Personal History</a>
<a href="#What-was-gained">What was gained</a>
<a href="#Why">Why</a>

<a id="Personal-History">Personal History</a>:
Before recently, I didn't know what philosophy even meant. To my knowledge it was old people pondering about "Is there life?", "What is the meaning of life?", "What is reality?", etc. I've come to learn that's a small part of it.

I recently started listening to a course from The Great Courses: The Great Ideas of Philosophy. With active listening I started with Wittgenstein, Turing, etc, things I found fascinating.

As I had more work, I became more passive, and I ended up listening to most of the 60-part series of lectures, with far less vigor. I imagine if I were as active as I was before the job, I wouldn't have gave it my time, but a the job slowed my brain down, and I was able to spoon-feed myself.

When I completed the job, I went to Taipei, stumbled upon a 24-hour bookstore nearby my new apartment, and found a section on Western Philosophy. In it, I found Bertrand Russell's History of Philosophy. I read most of Russell's History of Western Philosophy, and skimmed most of the other books, figuring out which I liked reading and felt there was much to learn from: Aristotle's work (in one volume really well prefaced by Richard McKeon), Wittgenstein's Tractacus and Philosophical Investigations, Francis Bacon's Essays, and bunch of Bertrand Russell's essays.

<a id="What-was-gained">What was gained</a>:
Before listening to the rest of the lecture series, I felt that listening to anything old did not make sense. Why not just use Wikipedia and get an answer that is up to current scientific findings? Current knowledge in neurology and psychology can discard many philosophies. There's no reason to read outdated philosophies. Although I still agree in many ways -- I don't value reading about epistemology, logic (understanding it and it's value is enough for me as of now; An aside: It's a pity I was taught logic in my computer science undergraduate but only vaguely remember memorizing the system to prove things without reason), and metaphysics --, as I listened to the rest of the series, I found other values.

Those other values: the joy of reading [Western] history and understanding why things happened (the role of Christianity, reasons empires rise and fall, why witch hunts existed, etc.), the joy of reading the biographies of great people (see how different personalities of great minds spend their lives), understanding their mindset and methods and approach to philosophy and how they made discoveries during their time (I thought The Great Courses lectures nailed this), helping organize knowledge (Aristotle) and helping organize history (both lectures and books are sequential), and ethics and political philosophy (both of which are branches that will never become obsolete, and both of which I feel I could learn something from all the way back to Aristotle).

I still have not delved deep into any particular philosophies, but if I were to, I'd probably read more ethics (especially Aristotle, and essays by Russell and Bacon), political philosophy (I was recommended Machiavelli), politics in history (this is probably considered history not philosophy though), and keep Philosophical Investigations as a general book for inquiry and fun knowing that empiricism, not books, is my preferred method.

<a id="Why">Why?</a>:
In addition to previously mentioned values, I've gained interests in fields I had no previous interest in, which may be the greatest reason why one should read it: to build interest in philosophy and its infinite surrounding subjects to further gain knowledge and understanding.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Autonomy of Taiwan</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[aka Why I Love Taiwan.

1. With the last [Philosophy and Human Values] lecture ending with apocalypse outcome, I feel Bush and Reagan in America is has something in common with the KMT in Taiwan. The difference is Taiwan reacts in solidarity with protests whereas America doesn't. Is this a result of post-modern society, or because White Terror killed many?

2. Taiwan is a single organism. What I love most about Taiwan, and similarly, Southeast nations, and mountain peoples (including Nepal and Northeast India), is solidarity of the community.

These civilizations contain those such basic human characteristics which seem to have disappeared in the Western countries, save in small town America and similar small town feel neighborhoods of large cities. Though nearly all of these nations suffer or have suffered greatly, the peoples seem to have achieved the highest state of ethics. They actually <em>care</em> for others. They will treat you out, or help you, whereas Western concepts of exchange of goods or services have become detached from morality. Basically, they have a heart. They look forward to life, and the simple pleasure in it. It is worth comparing it to Western society and seeing what went wrong [todo, another blog post. Street life and simple pleasure. Time and self-interest. Several generations in one country.].

A nation of solidarity, not the temporary directional kind, leads to autonomy. All of these nations have enough resources to be self-sufficient, no matter what their international relations are. Taiwan takes it further, being a part of the Four Asian Tigers, gaining and efficiently using modern technology. And yet, throughout several political turmoils Taiwan lives on, in a rather good standing compared to the rest of the world in human development.

Solidarity and autonomy are characteristics of an anarchy. In Taiwan, the police are rather complacent, lax on laws -- foreigners run illegal shops, and there isn't much over-enforcement of shallow laws, such as parking tickets, and they hold good morals, never pushing a homeless person out of a park, yet some laws are very strict, such as those on drugs. The hospitals are affordable (I don't know how). NGOs actually hold some power. Universities hold more. It feels as if society is checked by society itself. Everyone knows everything going on (perhaps that giant bulletin board system has a part in this). It feels like a neighborhood on a country level. The result is the greatest achievement in politics: just as the individuals it consists have, the society has a heart too.

3. Do protests work? Why not go further, boycott a KMT business?
Chomsky says yes and emphasizes methods of activism, which activist organization of Taiwan have done so well, thanks to past experiences, but though with outstanding protest results, did not sway political decisions, or win much praise from foreign countries (perhaps they are busy and content with other imperialistic concerns).

--
Update. Much after writing this, I've found some relevant articles and readings:
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-politics">post-politics</a>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomism">autonomism</a>

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiotext(e)">Semiotext(e)</a>

And surprisingly, and relevant, these <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tao">Tao</a> classics:
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhuangzi_(book)">莊子</a>
  - <a href=" https://wordery.com/the-tao-of-nature-chuang-tzu-9780141192741">short edition of the book</a>

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tao_Te_Ching">道德經</a>
  - <a href="https://wordery.com/tao-te-ching-lao-tzu-9780141043685">short edition of the book</a>
<blockquote>Therefore the sage keeps to the deed that consists in taking no action and practises the teaching that uses no words.

The myriad creatures rise from it yet it claims no authority; 
It gives them life yet claims no possession; 
It benefits them yet exacts no gratitude; 
It accomplishes its task yet lays claim to no merit.

It is because it lays claim to no merit 
That its merit never deserts it.</blockquote>

During much of my time in Asia (Taipei, Taiwan, Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur, Penang, India, and Taipei again) I experienced high anxiety, loss of reality, and unimaginable happiness.

At first, I figured it was simply the effect of weather [link to effects of weather] on dopamine. Clearly high temperature and sunlight affected me. After reading a few articles of Wikipedia, I re-diagnosed this time as mania.

I experienced all of the effects of Mania: extroverted characteristics, pressured speech, racing thoughts, unable to work for long periods of time without external stimuli, ADHD; problems with physiology: sleeping less, more active lifestyle.

During travel in Asia, I'd wake up, rush to figure out what to do, then somewhat execute it, making up trip along the way. Every hour of travel was a new experience, something to consume, extending time [link to time]. I was at awe and wonder throughout, meeting people, exploring, deeply thinking about the things around me (how things have come to be, anthropology, etc.), and thinking about ways for me to produce something from my interactions. 

I didn't talk to people. I extract the information I wanted from them. Or, explored together. I was a monster and information from external sources was my food.

All I had to do was spend time moving around outside, seeing the public for a few hours during the heat and sunlight to satisfy my body. I'd often return to a hostel late at night socialize.

Perhaps in countries I could not interact with locals, I substituted with observing.]]></content:encoded>

and writing feels actionless
cone of learning
philosophy of action

Or, reading is often passive, merely consumption.

I consider research as action. For example, when one reads a concept of something in Wikipedia.

But I consider reading an entire book a passive experience. What parts of that book were necessary for one's research? Could it have been skimmed? What is lost in skimming?

I feel in skimming (directed reading, action) one maintains their direction. If I were to write a book on a specific part of psychology, only those things that relate to that specific part are necessary.

One has ignore a great amount of knowledge. This is normal [find vocab].

A digression: Outside of books, the brain does this all of the time to rationalize the world.

But what I've come to recently understand, is that, while one does take action efficiently, there is a possibility that, ignoring some knowledge, one actually doesn't an understanding of it, perhaps losing an opportunity to gain foundational long-term knowledge [link to why read the western philosophy canon] or, misunderstands it, and this leads to anti-intellectualism: action without sufficient knowledge.

As a highly empirical person whose read few books, and plans to write more blogs with large generalizations based on my empirical knowledge, I must understand that these are just generalizations, and the understanding is beyond me, and the amount of time to research and make a good argument is something I will likely value less and prioritize less than some other action.

I shall only write what I, up to current knowledge, understand, and live a normal life, without veering it toward research to write a big book to prove it.

Perhaps this is being lazy, but I value and therefore prioritize other actions  more because reading does not satisfy [that feeling].

[missed the whole argument about reading is not social, a way communication, and I find it difficult to inquire. And the argument of reading being at the bottom of the cone of learning]]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Conciseness in Art</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[[Witten while quite drunk after a KTV party. Todo: Needs more work.]

Purpose: Conciseness in art is key to contemplation and creativity.

Some of my favorite art, ones that I feel deserve the time of it's length, are concise.

Literature:
In single chapter of Invisible Cities by Italo Calvino, I feel satisfied. I consumed enough to trigger my brain to begin contemplating, creating, mixing in with my own thoughts. The power of literature is not in detail, but in imagination.

If imagination is not the goal, I still feel conciseness is powerful. In Francis Bacon's Essays, more about ethics is told in few words. Likewise in Borjes's Ficciones, the stories are told only to display its mechanics. (Although, there is and I dislike the large amount of references)

Film:
Film is a medium of visuals, not words. Motion is key.

Wong-Kar Wai's film's dialogue is condensed to poetry. Visuals and poetry. The characters don't speak with social realism, yet it maintains the beauty, because the beautiful visuals and body motion provided by Chris.

Tsai-Ming Liang's films have little to no dialogue, yet, it retains all the power, even enhanced by the lack of language: a distraction.

Games (and interactive art):
If films can be made without language, so can the medium above it: games. Each game is a language. One interacts with the rules of a game; the grammar.

As proved simply and humbly by Passage by Rohrer, or, with the thrill provided by large scale, Shadow of the Colossus, games do away with language. Furthermore, as proved with playground games, games do not need visual. Just rules. The beauty of games lies neither in language or visual, but with rules. Johann Sebastian Joust is exemplary. Visuals and sounds are supplementary, and often, unnecessary.

New Media:
Simply finding ways to interact is often enough. [need to think more]

Public Art:
Quite different, in that it's not distributable, but still, conciseness still persists.

Banksy figured out with stencils that it isn't the skill of a painting, that even a stencil will do. Instead it's the image, place, and statement. A simple stencil of a rat in the right place is enough.

In a life of constant action, efficiency [todo: link to efficiency post] is key. But that's digressing more toward a philosophy of life as am creator rather than a critique of work.

Performance:
?

Art as Experience:

In the information age, what should be written?

The Humanities and Sciences:
This is what should be written, mostly in the form of essays, or concise prose, like Wittgenstein, or if one had talent, Bacon and Montaigne. Without much skill one likely cannot defeat the past writers in humanities (thinking fundamental ethics and political science), and without much research one likely cannot defeat current writers in sciences. Instead it may be best to mix the fundamentals with a modern context, especially those one has deep knowledge in. For me that is: aesthetics (new media, games), current anthropology (travels), psychology (my own), education (my own), and trans-disciplinary thoughts (what I understand from empiricism).

Literature of artistic merit:
Contemporary prose and poetry. Nobel Prize for Literature winners are good examples. But, this is an very old medium, where much has been explored for thousands of years. I would not dare go this route, although, I feel it would be fun to write something mind-expanding or mechanical not dislike Calvino and Borges. I have read very little, and plan to keep it that way, in favor of newer media.

Other reasons:
There's probably more good reasons (not practice or traditional blogs), like journalism.

My method:
I feel the best way is to use my own journal and try to understand my largely empirical history through inquiry and deduction. To do this I think it's best to <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/the-purpose-of-a-blog-a-medium-for-essays-and-self-assessments">organize all thoughts into one digital form a la this blog</a>. Perhaps keep a page of links to things that I still don't understand, to always know what requires more inquiry. Once I understand everything, I should stop writing, and live more.

There is a problem though. I haven't figured out <a href="how-and-when-to-write-and-the-impossibility-of-a-solitary-life">how to write</a>, at least, a substantial amount, consistently.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[[Old draft, just posting.]

Every little place where people are building communities and exploring should be praised.

Amazing things are being done every moment, rarely documented, because people are taking action, experimenting every day, resulting in great ideas, going unknown, unrewarded.

The problem is how to document (for knowledge and the sake of history), organize, and award where it's due? The community is too active to do such chores. Society is always behind on ideas. Books are always few years behind reality in small spaces of cities. Newer medias, internet videos proliferate knowledge, but to only those in the know, and furthermore it can be quite difficult for anyone outside to grasp it in context of history.

If new thoughts and works should be left to the artists who live on categorical imperative, and the documentation of them to academia, the gap persists.]]></content:encoded>

I've read less books than most elementary school children in my lifetime. I was never able to extract as much value per time with enjoyment factored in in books compared to other mediums, and empericism. Wikipedia was enough. Much recently, <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/why-read-the-western-philosophy-canon">I listened to an audiobook of Great Ideas in Philosophy provided by the Great Courses</a>; That was successful. After that, I figured out I had huge gaps in my knowledge, and proceeded to create a list of things I felt could be worth reading (or listening) to.

Non-fiction:

Philosophy:
- For philosophy
- For the organization of knowledge
- Use audiobooks to consume slowly while simultaneously doing something
- ethics - ethical treatises by Aristotle, various essays by Bertrand Russell
- political science - The Republic, Politics, The Prince (and other works), and something more modern
- philosophy - Philosophical Investigations

Natural Sciences:
- For knowledge of science
- For research
- prefer large historical or trans-discipline pieces that are up to date - Gödel, Escher, Bach, Thinking, Fast and Slow, A Brief[er] History in Time, Big History from The Great Courses, etc. These books compete with online lectures [link to self-education]

Fiction:
- For art
- Contemporary masterpieces, including comics, especially those of Nobel Prize winners in 
Literature. Although, I would likely choose other mediums over this, and empiricism over all all art

Others:
- Language books

- Biographies of great people:
-- For knowledge
-- For fun (possibly my favorite reading material, possibly because it's most humane; The same reason applies to coming-of-age films)
-- Use Wikipedia
-- Many of the online lectures cover biographies, to allow more insight on their decisions

- Essays by great essayists, and possibly the small writings of other great writers
-- Experience good writing to help develop one's own writings style
-- For knowledge, and fun (same reasons as biographies of great people)]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[TODO: translate to Chinese

In the <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/why-have-a-personal-blog">first post of this blog</a>, I question and answer why having one. I am now further specifying the purpose of this blog.

Everything starts with my thoughts, which are recorded in my journal. My journal is in the form of a text file I've kept since 10th grade and the Notes application on my iPhone. I've also haphazardly wrote some thoughts on a few notebooks. Although I love writing on physical paper, carrying a bunch of notebooks is undesirable for nomadic travel. Perhaps, I could send them home every so often, but even that would require me to be at home to have access to them. The best way, I've found (which I haven't done yet: I still use Notes) is to use a text editor application that can edit text files on dropbox. If that feels risky, one can always backup the dropbox file themselves every so often.

My journal serves two purposes: history and thoughts.

The blog, I feel, should consist of more organized, readable, thoughts, which I likely wrote during an active time in life, and which perhaps may be transformed into essays. And the history may be examined for <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/a-self-assessment-ii">self-assessment</a> and inquiry.

The medium did not have to be a blog, but I've, over time, come to like Wordpress. There is even an application for it on the iPhone which is very good. For me, it must be digital, mostly because I have a nomadic life. I actually thought a Wikipedia would be best. Perhaps it is; I just never felt Wordpress was bad enough for me to change.

So, the purpose of this blog is to serve as a medium to write essays and to create a historical self-assessment, both for the sake of philosophical inquiry with myself.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[THIS IS JUST A THOUGHT

Purpose:
I feel, that in competitive video games, there is a massive amount of decision-making going at amazing speeds, and somewhere in that time, there are things in psychology, particularly decision-making, where some new knowledge may exist.

What to do:
Detail advanced, real-time decision making through professional-level competitive games. Write how professionals win. Write it empirically, then scientifically.

Why video games over past games?
Chess is turn-based. Sports are real-time, but there's a strong emphasis on physical. Video games have physical limits too, but it's less prominent, usually limited to hand-eye coordination.

Is there a reason to examine real-time? What's the difference between decision making in real-time as opposed to turn-based? Time, duh. More decisions are made during a period of time, and, there's not enough time to make the rights ones.

SSBM
StarCraft
Thinking, Fast and Slow?

<blockquote>Homes are safe spaces, and feel trivial.</blockquote>



NEEDS MORE WORK

Purpose:
I think there's a huge fallacy with the concept of a home. A place to return to.

Arguments against:
Why spend the time to commute to and from home? It's rote, routine. One experiences less, and one is more likely turn to media to procrastinate. One will likely perform less action, make less decisions, be less observant, be less creative, more likely to seek the comfort of home, become complacent, and conspicuously consume, more likely through media rather than the real world.

The idea of physically living away from work, and having to commute to it is silly. Companies should consider if employees need to physically be available, or, is a phone call or video chat enough?

The fact that people are kicked out of public parks for sleeping there in Western countries is crazy.

For me personally, home, whether my parent's house, a shared apartment (especially when my roommates are gone), is and historically has always been the death of action and me.

Arguments for:
Temperature regulation, electricity, privacy, security, cooking appliances, etc. and the convenient, permanent package of it all.

The greatest argument, is, perhaps, relationships, family and friends.

But wouldn't it be greater to live with family in friends in a more active lifestyle? Perhaps leading to a more communal lifestyle, not based on family.

Nomadism:
But what if a country provided everything in the public? Most developed countries <em>do</em> provide everything necessary to live, quite well, in the public. And some do it well.

I think Taiwan is a model for nomadic living. The cheap food prices akin to developing countries, super convenient convenient stores akin to Japan, and politeness of allowing one to be able to sleep anywhere, as long as one doesn't make a mess.

A Tangent:
Nomadism can be seen living off the excesses of the world. Knowing this, one knows that there's enough space in the public to comfortably house all of the homeless.

There's certainly something certainly disturbing with the cost of property, which provokes thoughts of socialism.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>How and When to Write, and the Impossibility of a Solitary Life</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I've recently lived an extremely practical life, so it is rare I take the time to write. Instead I merely jot thoughts in a journal. Like Nietzsche, I need a life of constant action, of which I only care for suffering, to take meaningful action. I only began writing after a very slow and long transition into a depressing slump. Writing without an audience, without purpose feels like dying; It ignores the world. Perhaps before I even begin writing, I need figure out how and when. 

How:
Perhaps I need to create a suitable environment for it, and that is I'm afraid, being away from the temptation of civilization, and, perhaps, those great writers who wrote in solitude, did so because they had to. I think it is only necessary for very large works. Small works can be rapidly periodically produced over a short period, similar to how Kerouac wrote On The Road, locking himself in the house, writing on a typewriter with one large continuous sheet of paper, while his wife spoon-fed him.

Still, I find it so wild that the act of writing, an action, requires one to be in solitude, where inaction often rises.

When (and little of What):
Why spend time writing at such an age, without achievement, without a mass amount of knowledge, when one could substitute that time for practical things? I feel Montaigne timed his writing correctly, after his public life, in retirement.

Perhaps only knowledge currently unknown to the world should be written currently; Perhaps it should be talked about with great people, debated, lectured, finally coming to a point where it should be written for others to see.

Perhaps writings based one's own experience can wait. Yet, the only things I feel should be written are based on my experience.

Perhaps there <em>are</em> things that should be written at a time. Some knowledge and feeling is temporary. Thoughts change. Writing about what knowledge I currently have may be worth writing.

Conclusion:
It seems there are two ways and times: while simultaneously taking action (balancing action and inaction) or retirement.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>The Obsolescence of Literature and the Future of Education</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I grew up with games in younger years, film in high school and early college. During middle school, I read Harry Potter because I needed to pass a book report; It was okay because I was also playing a video game simultaneously. It wasn't until a year or so after college I read a book. I read two: Watchmen and Invisible Cities. One isn't even a book, it's a comic book! 

When I read Invisible Cities, it made me think. No other book had done that for me previously. Furthermore, it aided me during creative times.

Watchmen had great insight into psychology and philosophy (which I didn't know the terms at the time), and used the medium in unique ways.

So, that left one book and one comic book until the age of 27, after listening to a philosophy lectures series, I found myself in the Western philosophy section of a book store reading away. What a weird experience: to read books.

I was recently going over what I felt would be a <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/a-liberal-arts-self-study-curriculum">liberal arts education</a> through media, books being the main thing to catch up on. After going through some, I confirmed some old beliefs, notably: books <em>are</em> dead.

In literature there is less content per time. In film, the mind takes it all in. The detail is infinite. If "a picture tells a thousand words" then a film tells millions. This is why I never read books with lengthy descriptions of things; I don't want to read about how a bedpost appears. The ideas are conveyed equally in films, just faster.

I found no reason to read any piece of classical literature. They take place in older societies which make it harder to relate, most don't try to portray reality (save for realism which came much later), and for the most part cover really basic ideas shallowly. They are lengthy fairy tales.

Books may have been the way ideas got around in the past, but we now have better media, including Wikipedia, to turn the media back into words.

That's where books can be useful, not literature, but non-fiction books which contain dialog that mix several ideas. I found books like A New History of Philosophy by Anthony Kenny, Bertrand Russell's essays, Understanding Power by Noam Chomsky, The Great Conversation by Mortimer Adler, What Technology Wants by Kevin Kelly, Debt: The First 5000 Years, The Life and Death of Great American Cities, all quite useful in organizing my experiences into words and their places in the sciences or humanities.

With brevity of art mediums also comes a time after experience, where the mind works, where creativity and will are pushed. The more potent the experience, the more likely one will take action. Though this is not the best way to go about making things, it's not bad, as many have proved with Invisible Cities. And of my opinion, it is often better to take action than not (assuming some rational).

As media evolves literature becomes more obsolete. I could probably create a curriculum of contemporary films that contain the same ideas that books did which take a fraction of time to consume, and one can better relate to because they take place in recent times. I could also suggest a curriculum of occupations, travels, and hobbies to an individual who would then experience those ideas. Still, I hope in the future that a curriculum of games could be made; That would simultaneously make education feasible and a real experience.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>JRPGs emulate travel</title>
		<link>http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/jrpgs-emulate-travel</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In an <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/my-justification-of-art-in-video-games" title="My Justification of Art in Video Games">ancient post</a> I had a very weak argument for the justification of art in games.

During my last week in Taiwan, I decided to travel the east coast, I was blown by the sublimity of Taiwan's nature -- karst mountains alongside a beach which erodes giant rocks in the most beautiful way -- and as I went through different landscapes it triggered the memory that JRPGs evoked: travel. While traveling through these landscapes and civilizations, it occurred to me that I learned and experienced them through JRPGs. It was a weird discovery.

JRPGs are frowned upon because the mechanics are not novel. But simply being able to walk, explore, talk to NPCs, simulates travel. You go through cities, suburbs, countryside, and interact with everything as a human would. The places and people exist. Art imitates nature.

In many ways, they confirms several ideas in life, and often, in a worldly scale. The motorcycle trip harked Final Fantasy, Seiken Densetsu, and Earthbound. Those hippie settlements one travels through exist in more natural parts of Thailand and Taiwan, and the people indeed have similar hippie minds. Those giant ugly cities, those charming small towns filled with happy people, those beaches with surfers, those farms, those islands with funky fruit, it's all there. Different cultures are portrayed so well in those games, even if they are fantastic, with animals as characters and symbols as language, the ideas are there. In Final Fantasy you can explore the whole world, seeing seeing water, forest, and deserts above; You can land the ship go to towns and cities, talk to people, shop, sleep. JRPGs are a simulation of the world. There is so much content and ideas a child can learn from it: people, places, cultures, anthropology, economics, art. Massive cities to suburbs (Earthbound, lol) to rural areas (Harvest Moon!). Cultures are vast: punk, geek, chivalry, contemporary office work, primitive tribal wars. Economics exist from simple barter to market systems in more modern games. JRPGs are a simulation of life. Best of all: it can all be achieved without the cons of travel.

I can't think of any film or graphic novel that has as much content as much as one would in a Final Fantasy game. Books don't provide images. Television series and comic book or manga series may, but I didn't grow up with those mediums.

During my trip, l learned I couldn't talk to myself forever and decided to consume some media. I hadn't listened to music for quite some time. I used 8tracks to find some JRPG music. As I motorcycled through various environments, the music supplemented the experience: travel music, town music, nature music. There was a particular moment where I was walking along a trail that followed a cliff with a beach below, an 8tracks playlist played the music from Miyazaki films, I felt a Totoro could be near.]]></content:encoded>

Thoughts:
Foreigners will have to go to a Gurudwara, take off their shoes, perhaps pray, then play. Perhaps kids who play it will be inspired to learn to play traditional instruments.

Further design:
Perhaps can think of other traditional instrument, game, and place of worship combinations.




notes:
Drawing digitally is a waste of time. I thought it would convey designs better, but perhaps paper is better if I can find a good workflow.]]></content:encoded>

Data output: sound through speaker overland

Idea:
Would people dance to a speaker? Would people donate without being able to prove? Would people donate to a speaker? Does the physical body of a musician matter?

Further design: Have speakers outside of an expensive concert play music live. Create a barrier and charge people at the entrance. Charge a fraction. Would people pay?]]></content:encoded>

		<title>A Design Strategy for Data</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This was inspired by the first week's Creativity and Computation class's lecture by Sven Travis.

A neat way design new media (which may be in the form of a game) is to think of the input and the output, based on the perceptions of humans.

I used this strategy in the past for games, where I'd think about all of the inputs the medium has, often an iPad, then create games using them. However, it only dawned to me during the lecture that data is not limited to mediums. Everything is data. In and out.
<div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/design-strategy-for-data.svg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2347" src="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/design-strategy-for-data.svg" alt="design strategy for data" /></a></div>
Personal designs:
<ul>
	<li>Track the motion of a falcon, whenever it swoops for an attack, output a "falcon punch" sound through a speaker in the public.</li>
	<li>When a sentence with the word love or hate is said on a social platform, have a speaker in the public output the sentence.</li>
	<li>Track rats over time, post the results in the form of a transportation transparency and paste it over a transportation map.</li>
	<li>Put a camera on a bum, output the video in a public square.</li>
	<li>Each time someone e-mails a government official a letter to appeal something, trigger a catapult to throw a ball of sand approximately at the official's office window.</li>
	<li>Each time a human dies from the fault of government, trigger a mechanism to splash blood on the White House.</li>
</ul>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[These thoughts were triggered after watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJMhcik7qx4">Babycastles talk at Indiecade 2014: Building an Alternative Dream</a>:

Anything that is public has an enabling effect. People can freely enter that area, use it however they like. This creates a feeling of freedom, allowing people to do work and feel proud of it.

Being physically near is different from interacting online, or through media.

It’s more likely to result in action, because, it's social.

<strong>My history with public places</strong>:
In the neighborhood I grew up in, I'd explore it and nearby neighborhoods by biking. Nature should be every child's first public place. I had friends on my street and in my neighborhood. We would bike together and to each others' houses.

During school, there would be breaks during lunch and recess. There would always be a place where people would meet and hang out.

In college there was a public room called "the retro room" (todo: deserves it's own blog). It mostly contained nerdy types because there were always TVs with video games hooked up. People would talk, play, read, work, eat, and sleep there.

After I moved to a rich neighborhood, I struggled and used media. Media is a one way interaction. I left it when I left the suburbs. From then on, I physically attended public places.

In SF, I would explore neighborhoods, attend free museum days, and attend free art events. I used public libraries (including UCSF library) and cafes and parks as regular places to do computer work. I also just generally spent a lot of time in transit: walking, running, on the 38, and on the Caltrain when I had my first job.

During this time, I gained knowledge in art aesthetic, physical space, people, but I lacked knowledge in their creative process, personal life, work life.

In New York, I explored again for nearly a month, in search of places to live. Later, I'd explore the ethnic enclaves. I used public transportation liberally. I began by volunteering for a public organization and voluntarily interning, seeing how artists work. Again, there were free art events -- lectures by NYU, comedy at the Upright Citizen's Brigade and Hannibal's place, free events on The Skint. For work, I mostly spent time at Pratt Institute's library.

I saw how film was made, how an organization was run. I continued exploring, but only what can be seen in the public, from the streets. I can see where capitalism is high or low, and where ethnic enclaves sustain a better life. Through game jams I made friends for game development.

During my travels I'd start at a hostel, I'd almost consider as a public place, some even allow you to enter the common room without sleeping there. Then I'd go explore the artificial and nature, all accessible to the public. I'd volunteer at places where anyone was allowed to (why anyone pays to volunteer is crazy).

What was a public space blurred with what was space. At some point, it didn't matter where I was. There was no reason to be in a cafe to use the computer, or a building, or on a chair. If I needed to use the computer I'd just whip out my laptop wherever I was (street, transit, nature), tether to a cheap 3G, and use the computer! I'd never spend any time in a residential or office building, just outside or in a public place, consuming the public, or in proximity of friends, maximizing time with friends and the public. Common rooms of hostel, parks, near street food, near points of interest, transport were common.

In East Asia, it didn't matter where I slept; There's no crime there. I'd sleep when I was tired, or at a friend's house, or at a park. It cut commute time.

In Taiwan, it didn't matter where I ate. The food was cheap enough to eat anywhere. There was no reason to go home. I could eat, sleep, work, anywhere. Absolute freedom.

<strong>Public Places as a Savior from Commoditization:</strong>
Public places in cities I think are closely associated to freedom. The sense of freedom gets lost in social norms of the artificial. People are conditioned to sleep at home, cook and eat at home, work in offices, and work more at home or at a cafe, leaving bars as the only place to socialize. This is the result of commoditization, people feel (and often do) that they have to pay to use a computer, pay to rent a book or dvd, pay to sleep, pay a cafe to use the internet, pay to park, pay to sleep, pay to travel, pay to pitch a tent, pay to drink water, pay to wash clothes. Without a healthy street life, worse, in the suburbs, it's possible that people live without knowing they could actually meet friends at a park, have a barbecue, and enjoy.

<strong>Public Places have Common Values</strong>:
The people that show up in an arcade, a free museum, a park, an outdoor public performance are of the same. In negative light, freeloaders. In positive, curious, wanting an experience, with people. It's publicly accessible, open to all people, especially, when in a city (for transport accessibility).

Because of those traits in the place itself, the people who attend have certain common values (mentioned in the video): free, open to all people (age, color, sex, whatever). A great portion of the people who come to these events turn out to be quite altruistic themselves, willing to spend time, share skills, socialize with anyone.

Public places are an option that's open, a stimulus. "Humans are by nature political animals", and when there is a choice between spending time at home or with people in a public place, it's likely the latter.

<strong>Public Spaces</strong>
Public spaces are little different. It's a more active place, a space where one can fill it in with whatever they like. The intention isn't to merely consume, but to interact, with people and things. A public space is where anyone can volunteer, pitch and run an event. That's very powerful, and requires creativity, artists. These often come in the form of DIY spaces, open mics at cafes or bars, music jams, game jams, and other forms of improvisational creation.

San Francisco's ATA, New York's spaces in Bushwick and Williamsburg, cafes across Asia, hackerspaces around the world.

In the video, it's mentioned spaces allow freedom to create work and feel proud of it. For people to feel good, does there need to be a feeling of freedom to create any work? Or does it require a social aspect, to collaborate with others, to create work?* (THINK MORE)

Also in the video, when spaces interact with other spaces, it creates a community of spaces.

Also in the video, when spaces interact with institutions, the aforementioned values have to be fought for.

The value of these places, perhaps, will require another blog post at another time.

TODO. THIS NEEDS WAY MORE THOUGHT. VERY IMPORTANT.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>A Liberal Arts Self Study Curriculum</title>
		<link>http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/a-liberal-arts-self-study-curriculum</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I've recently felt I've lacked knowledge in liberal arts. People around me have libraries of books. I have nothing. They're able to speak lucidly about certain subjects referencing a common history, whereas I base my knowledge entirely on personal experiences. I have little knowledge in the domain of history (and how knowledge developed historically to affect the present). Though this doesn't mean I dislike my empirical education, nor do I care to listen to dead old white dudes, rather, I just want to verify some thoughts to better organize all of the thoughts I've empirically gathered over the past 5 years.

After a recent <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/a-personal-journey-through-books" title="A Personal Journey through Books">personal journey through books</a>, the list has been updated accordingly.

The Curriculums:
I see two.

1. MIT offers several (nearly all?) through the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenCourseWare">OpenCourseWare</a> program. They <a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm">offer</a> substantially more than other colleges that have this program. They even provide <a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mit-curriculum-guide/">curriculum guides</a>. I've just learned about the curriculum part 5 minutes ago and am now thinking about changing to this. [TODO: BRB!]

2. Media. In general, contemporary museums for aesthetics, films for humanities, TV documentaries for natural sciences, books for history, philosophy, and science. As always, supplied with Wikipedia and life.

<strong><a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a></strong>:
The current greatest gift to humans.

<strong>Contemporary museums</strong>:
Unfortunately modern contemporary museums only exists in cities. I guess more progressive art websites work as well, such as Yale's fine arts. For technology and art, there's MIT Media Lab, NYU ITP, Parsons D&T, and so on.

Consuming these will likely cause one's mind to skip to current aesthetics, likely finding any older medium aesthetically outdated.

Consuming these will also just provide pleasure and perhaps lead to discover new things. If an art object contains a criticism of society, one might be interested in figuring out how society came to be. In this way, they wake people up from "dogmatic slumber", in an aesthetically current way.

<strong>Films</strong>:
I grew up with films as being part of my formative years, but now it's less forming. It seems the aforementioned BBC documentaries defeat films for longer forms of content. One would have to just select whatever film or documentary that related to their current research.

I've found Kevin Kelly keeps a list of "<a href="http://truefilms.com/">true films</a>" which he states:

<blockquote>"I present here the best general interest true films I've found. I define true films as documentaries, educational films, instructional how-to's, and what the British call factuals - a non-fiction visual account."</blockquote>

One can find BBC's Ascent of Man, A Blank on the Map, Grizzly Man, Baraka, and a slew of other things. He writes a small note about each one which is really helpful.

I've recently personally been going over the winners of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prize_of_the_Ecumenical_Jury">Prize of the Ecumenical Jury</a>, and often the director's other films, though, their aim is more philosophical, really getting at human nature. The last two films I saw connected to the Algerian War in two very different ways. Though these films do not provide an ordered source of education, I still feel there's a lot to learn with every film, and which may spark interest or gestalts because the films themselves are so damn aesthetically pleasing. Just the last film alone makes me want to watch that old Algerian War film about guerrilla warfare, learn why French Revolution was so bad, read a biography on Rimbaud, and figure out why racism still exists in France and the US.

<strong>TV Documentaries</strong>
Books are dull. I was reading a more modern one, What Technology Wants, and though it's disjointed, I enjoyed a lot of it. In many chapters it connects technology with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_History">Big History</a> (including science and history, cosmos and cosmic evolution). This lead to lots of Wikipedia'ing, and eventually coming to some old BBC science TV documentary series. Though Columbia has a "Frontiers of Science" course, I've found these shows provide a great amount of information that still is scientifically correct, and can still serve as a good core and starting point for anyone. The great thing about these documentaries is that many actually do go over a Big History which provides a cohesive history and science (all of the sciences!). The top three that cover a big history are Connections, Cosmos, and The Ascent of Man. All three are brilliant mostly because they are presented by such caring presenters with such beautiful personalities.

Here's a list I've gathered:
- Connections* - James Burke, history of science and technology
- Cosmos* - Carl Sagan, cosmos, astrology
- The Ascent of Man* - Jacob Brownowski, science, second, focus from migration / agriculture to world war two
- Civilisation* - Kenneth Clark, art, first, from dark ages to modern 1969,
- The Day The Universe Changed** - James Burke, more philosophical take of the history of science and technology
- Life on Earth, The Living Planet, Trials of Life, Life, Planet Earth - David Attenborough’s main series of Earth
- The Real Thing - James Burke, human perception
- The Shock of the New - art up to modernism
- World at War* - world war II, documentary more so than BBC style presentation
- America - third, from 1500 to 1972
- The Cell - ?

Some of these can be found online on YouTube. If not, one can pirate, or try to get one on half.com to build an amazing library for a child.

<strong>Books</strong>:
The most relevant and current source in philosophy I know is <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/wiki/readinglist">Reddit's philosophy reading</a> list. It categorizes all current knowledge of philosophy and provides the current standards of books, essays, and articles for each. In it, it constantly references, for good reason, <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/">Stanford's encyclopedia of philosophy</a>. And, of course, there's also the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy">wikipedia article on philosophy</a>.

A good source for modern science books is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Society_Prizes_for_Science_Books">The Royal Society Prizes for Books</a>. This is where popular cohesive history books like A Short History of Nearly Everything, The Information, and books by Jared Diamond and Steven Hawking exist.

A rather outdated source for philosophy is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Books"> Great Books</a>. It's a method of learning through books. It's traditional, euro-centric, going through the Western Canon, more philosophy and science oriented than other similar book series, but outdated and exhaustive, especially in a time with more current medias replacing most of the content in fraction of time in a more aesthetically pleasing manner. The most well known curriculum based off that is Columbia College's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_Curriculum_(Columbia_College)">Core Curriculum</a>, something all student's must partake during their first year. On their <a href="http://www.college.columbia.edu/core/core">website</a>, a current syllabus is available for Contemporary Civilization (mainly philosophy that are still relevant -- epistemology, ethics, social sciences) and Literature Humanities, both of which contain all of the readings and exact textbooks in sequential order, but unfortunately does not specifically show all of the selections of texts, or provide any materials. In addition to those two supposed year-long courses, there's semester-long arts, music, writing, science, and frontiers of science. Of them, only two, arts and frontiers of science, have the some materials available online, but even then, they are missing lectures.

My greatest concern is philosophy, so the Contemporary Civilization syllabus is a perfect fit for me. To supplement the readings, one can use <a href="http://www.thegreatcourses.com/">The Great Courses</a> lectures and questions (nearly all can be pirated), after each reading. I personally did not care for literature humanities and would even say that films replace them easily. Their music and art syllabus can be completed in day each just by experiencing the arts. I have not tried the frontiers of science, but it could be good if one doesn't feel that their knowledge in science is cohesive enough, but again, the BBC TV Series probably do a better job at presenting this.

Actually getting access to the books is quite cumbersome, even in the information age, which is a pity. It seems, going to the library still may be one of the best ways. If one prefers actual books at their own abode, then online bookstores are the way. <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/ebooks" title="eBooks">eBooks are still quite an odd experience, but there <em>is</em> a good application for it</a>. Googling the book name and "epub" or "pdf" is a pretty good way of getting most of the classics. Otherwise, one has to pirate modern books (pro tip: see the user workerbee on piratebay). <a href="http://prodigalnomore.wordpress.com/great-books-of-the-western-world-as-free-ebooks/">Someone took the time to link the Great Books to free online resources</a>; a hefty feat, but the translations can be awful. There's also <a href="https://librivox.org/">Librvox recordings</a> of classics (available via smartphone app too), which are way better than a robotic voice. Amazon's Kindle has many classics for free too, but I prefer the non-propietary format so I can use it with any application.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[aka how do books work?

In some past blogs posts, like <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/the-obsolescence-of-literature-and-the-future-of-education">this one</a>, I basically claim books are dead, or at the least the last form one should get knowledge from. And after embarking on this quest through books, I almost confirmed that idea.

These great books curriculums vanished for good reason. At first, I thought they would be interesting because through a The Great Courses course on The Great Ideas in Philosophy I found many of the ideas interesting, mostly because the professor lectured well. There was a bit of history, biography, chronological ordering, and new thoughts [to me] from Wittgenstein, Kant. For the most part it was just consolidating past thoughts into terms. It was also fun to see how knowledge came about through the history of time, without the internet.

After listening to the lecture series I went into a 24 hour book shop in Taiwan, found a Western Philosophy section, one of the few sections in English. Using a History on Philosophy by Bertrand Russell, I joyously went through some Aristotle, Bacon's Essays (my first set of Essays), some essays by Bertrand Russell, the last book of a New History of Philosophy by Anthony Kenny, and skimmed many other books.

Again, similar to the lecture series, the books were fun to see how knowledge accumulated through books, how knowledge forms in general, how civilization took the wrong direction at times, how religions form, how education and of poor knowledge had bad consequences, how people would try to make ultimate ideologies of ways to live life, why people make art, reading biographies -- to see the actions they took, their personalities, comparing it to my own; getting some history in along the way, how societies collapse, and at the beginning consolidating ideas into philosophic terms or sciences. I would read some of History of Philosophy, check Wikipedia for things that interested me, read a bunch of related links, and move on. That was fun, lots of brain stimulation. Many things related to my thoughts at the time.

When I arrived to my parent's house in suburban America, I figured I would be interested in some of the philosophy books, especially those mentioned in the Core Curriculum by Columbia. It turns out, that wasn't so fun. The books are dry, repeat knowledge, and repeat ideas one's already been exposed to through other medias or life. I would say only a handful from Contemporary Civilization are useful; Most of the content is useless including all of the religious texts, and all literature from Literature Humanities, aesthetically and philosophically. Wikipedia provides a better history of art. BBC documentaries provide a better way of teaching science and history. <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/wiki/readinglist">Reddit Reading List</a> provides a modern list of books to read for philosophy (epistemology, ethics, politics, and even cognitive science). And in general, it's just doesn't feel as creative-inducing as simply walking around a city and thinking. All of this lead to me updating <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/a-liberal-arts-self-study-curriculum" title="A Liberal Arts Self Study Curriculum">the liberal arts self study curriculum</a> I had first created.

Instead of reading a series of books it seems the path I took in that book shop in Taipei was a good way of learning how books work. There's no reason to read most of the books entirely. Just go in a bookstore and have fun. I hope to complete the series of political books, but I really need to be interested in it again. Instead, I found Understanding Power: The Indispensable Chomsky way more interesting, relevant, and conducive to action. Many modern non-fiction books contain the knowledge of history using the science of now, so books like Debt: The First 5000 years and books by Jared Diamond feel vastly superior. Cognitive science, starting with conceptual metaphors seemed the best place to start for epistemology.

So, it seems an empirical, progressive, city-dwelling, creative, social, traveling, hippie life is indeed the way to go. Besides, perhaps I'll be able to get through some of these books through audiobooks while in transit or doing some non-brainy work. Or, I won't, but I'll understand the ideas through more interesting experiences. In the joy of gaining knowledge I always overdo it, and in doing so, gain less.

update:
In hindsight, it seems it was more of a journey of figuring out how books are organized, or, how knowledge is organized in books. Watching a film, one gains insight of nearly the entire humanities. Non-fiction books don't. My interest was philosophy, but even the Wikipedia article wasn't satisfactory in organizing the books for me. Nor was The Great Books or the Columbia class. It wasn't until I found Reddit's Reading List that I felt at ease. And in doing so, I feel happier. For now.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[[pending, took one stab at it. Need to combine with <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/a-self-assessment" title="A Self-assessment"> and </a> <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/a-self-assessment-ii" title="A Self-assessment II">self-assessment II</a>.]

Recently, after being awoken by The Great Ideas of Philosophy lecture series by The Great Courses during my time in Taiwan, I became interested in gaining a <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/a-liberal-arts-self-study-curriculum" title="A Liberal Arts Self Study Curriculum">"liberal arts education"</a>. It was cut short as I came to the conclusion that <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/the-obsolescence-of-literature-and-the-future-of-education" title="The Obsolescence of Literature and the Future of Education">books merely organize my experience into a written language</a>. After this conviction, I decided to go over my education historically, to see how my knowledge developed.

Childhood:
Playing games with friends, biking, exploring neighborhoods, eating, family vacations, family events (Indian marriages), fixing computers, fixing other things, staying up late, waking up late, always doing something.

Age 1-3:
I don't know. I'm told I was really cute. What happened to me afterward, or to other's opinion, I am not sure.

Age 4:
I was given a bike. I biked a lot.

I also went to pre-school. No problems there according to this report card: "Favorite activity: likes the computer, building with blocks, the playhouse. I get mad when: I bump my head. When I grow up, I'm going to be: Santa Claus. I like to go to: the beach, the park, and the 300." Even now I wouldn't alter those answers. I'm surprised I liked the computer in 1991. Was I referring to my Dad's Tandy 2000(?) or the school's computer with Math Blaster?

Age 5:
I kicked off those pesky training wheels. I went further around my neighborhood. I loved kindergarten. I could play with the sandbox, read random books; National Geographic was cool then.

Elementary School:
Since age 4, I played with my friends who lived on the street and my cousins when they came, or when I went to their houses. I lived in the suburbs, but my neighborhood was surprisingly bike friendly with ditches behind houses and trails that followed alongside.

I did fine at Elementary school. Straight A's in fourth grade, and I particularly remember first, second, and fourth grades quite well. I wrote rather slowly, and often very neatly when I did, and really disliked writing much because of it. Although Algonquians were interesting, my hand hurt.

I showed my first sign of grade slippage at fifth grade, and perhaps an increase in sleeping.

Middle School:
My best friend of third to fifth grade had moved. We used to go on bike adventures, jump ditches, fight, and talk over esoteric interests.

Slowly, I gravitated toward console games and computers. I also remember using Napster to download music. My knowledge of music aesthetics was expanding, from Eminem to Wu-Tang to Radiohead! I was still placing third on track running (my body height restricted me) and high on physical tests.

Middle school was a place to sleep, be conditioned to change classes when the bell rang, four to six times a day? I don't remember any of it.

High School:
I continued with more time allocated to indoor activities, perhaps Diablo II had come out. I also continued sleeping in school, doing quite poorly during freshman year. At least there were less bells.

Then I moved temporarily to my Dad's motel. It's on a commercial road of which had no interest whatsoever. It was my worst time, clearly shown by my chubby face. The first and only time I had one. It didn't even have good internet, so I had trouble playing any sort of game. I was into some horrendously slow RPGs (from MMOPG.net? Or something?) and Starcraft and maybe Firearms (a Half-life mod); Whenever someone would call, I would be lag, die or be forced to quit in the game.

Yet, I did well in school. Did I give up on exploring, completely fall victim to the passive educational system? I remember being angry for not being able to get a driver's license while the other kids did.

Then I moved, deeper into the suburbs, a rich gated community, with no child playing outside in sight. I don't know what happened to my bicycle. I guess I didn't care either. I didn't have my friends to bike with. I'm not sure what I did with my free time then. Perhaps I continued with internet and games.

I remember one great class: electric tech. You'd just have a workbench full of super glue guns, materials for circuits, materials for woodworking, and G3 Macs with audio and video editing software. It was heaven. We'd make remote control toy cars, circuits, watch Chapelle Show, listen to Kanye, and just enjoy. At least, that's what I remember. And the teacher, Mrs. Knaack, was awesome. It was perhaps also influential to a classmate who later created music for rappers.

College August 2005 – May 2009:
After high school, I immediately entered college for a bachelor's in Computer Science. There were several math and science requirements, maybe one literature / writing, and perhaps more that I forgot. But, nothing felt cohesive or striking.

One class was exceptional for being practical. One where I had to build a web forum. Lame, but it was perhaps one of the few outlets of creativity. Wow, that's crazy to think of now: a single outlet of creativity from four years?

I think the first year I had spent quite some time on World of WarCraft and Team Fortress II. After that, I spent a lot of time playing <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/a-critical-analysis-of-super-smash-bros-melee" title="A Critical Analysis of Super Smash Bros. Melee">Super Smash Bros. Melee</a> with what became a great group of friends.

I'd continue to consume media through the internet. Random videos, lots of Wikipedia. Really disjointed. Though, by the second year, perhaps because of the advent of high-speed internet, I consumed <em>a lot</em> of music. It was 2007. I listened to everything on Pitchfork, loving Grizzly Bear and Beach House, and seeing them in concert. Similarly, with the advent of Netflix, I consumed <em>a lot</em> of films. I watched There Will Be Blood, No Country for Old Men, Chungking Express, and a ton of foreign films. I remember watching two films a week, returning them immediately and queueing the next. In no time I reached the classics of films: Tokyo Story, Yi Yi, Harakiri, 400 Blows, Life is Beautiful, Bicycle Thieves, and so on.

Software Developer at Segin Systems in Virginia Beach, VA
My first “professional” job. I developed code for their flagship web based real estate software. Most of the time was spent implementing interfaces to scrape data from ancient third party title software databases to be sent via web services. The rest of the time was spent extending the superbly coded web site, written by the lead developer who made fine use of the .NET framework. An amazing first programming job as there were only two other developers, and most of the time was spent programming. 

Work near Home February – October 2010:
I worked as a programmer near my parent's house. I worked. I made money. I continued playing Smash Bros., though less. I continued watching films perhaps at an near equal rate. Still, I hadn't taken much action in life, and had a rather narrow view of life because of it.

I knew I was going to leave my hometown, but I thought it was best to have a little “experience” before doing so. After about nine months of working, I quit. Then I went to San Francisco.

San Francisco February – May 2011:
Something enlivened me immediately when I got out of the airport, into The Mission, at a cheap hotel where a nice owner directed me toward a nearby street to eat some peruvian fish dish. <em>I began to explore again</em>. I had a whole city to explore, by foot, metro, bus, and later, bicycle. There was so much to learn, so much to do. But I worked really far from my apartment in San Francisco, so I only had the weekends free to explore, learn.

I quickly found an apartment on craigslist. Equally quickly, to my surprise, I found a job on craigslist somewhat related to the game industry.

I worked as something less than a programmer for a larger company. I made money.

I knew and warned that I was going to leave within the first week, but I stuck to the job because I was still absorbing the experience, mainly related to living in San Francisco. I tried to help the company as much as I could but I came to the conclusion that my radical (in their perspective) input was meaningless in a large company, and my desire for something more meaningful, or at least more meaningful than managing websites for terribly bland MMORPGs, made me leave.

I'd spend the weekends exploring.
... TO BE CONTINUED.

...
Pros and cons of my education:

Pros:
- Not basing art on history, and generally not being able to decipher art from life
- Requires more creativity in dialog to talk out an idea, or references something from personal experience, or from contemporary media
- More active
- More experiential
- More fun
- Able to understand everything one experiences

Cons:
- Appearing less knowledgable because of the inability to relate it to a larger context of the humanities
- Learning may be less efficient at times because there is no structure
- Learning may be significantly uneven because there is no structure
- Slowed learning during early years without direction or tutor* (of middle school, high school, and college, only two classes stood out)]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[[Old draft, publishing anyway.]

I value action over words, the time of inscribing over a medium, as opposed to experiencing or thinking of something else is a waste, unless one can simultaneously do both.

Although I value action over words, now is the first time in my life that I’d like to verify my thoughts, many of which have never formed into words, and unfortunately, the fastest way to transform a thought into a medium is language.

I believe verbal language is inferior to visual in its efficiency to transmit knowledge and ideas.

A more efficient, progressive manner of gaining knowledge and taking action would be to live and act simultaneously, taking the highest order of action one is able. In fine artists, especially the more progressive kinds [thinking Fluxus], I feel to some extent they live in this manner.

Many professions in the modern world separate life and action. If one works on a computer in an office, perhaps the only action one can take is to listen to something. Often music, but audiobooks are possible too. If one is writing, one is often in some kind of room that doesn't offer much in terms of experience.

My entire post-college past has been to do both, live and act. To do computer work on a train, to write during a protest, to eat while teaching, to sleep on a bus.

The goal in life often said is "to love your work". The goal in life should be to live and work. In the former, work is conceived as something someone does at a time separately from life, whereas the latter is doing both simultaneously.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[My favorite film director, Hirokazu Koreeda, film from 2013, Like Father Like Son, continues his consistent master-craft.

I personally have not seen a film in many months because I was living a very social life, and it had become quite difficult to become engaged with a video from a screen.

I've been in my parent's house for more than a month, slowly transforming from a manic to a sloth, from peak creativity to hibernation. Finally, I gave in to watching a film, allowing some one else to direct my thoughts.

Instead of giving a review, I've decided to just post my thoughts during the film. I watched it in two sessions, the first, actively philosophical, and the second, more similar to my college days -- absolutely mesmerized. And so, my thoughts are divided as such, unequal in length.

<strong>My Thoughts</strong>:
session one:
It's been a very long time since I've been able to watch a film, and even when I did, the content of the film matched the lifestyle I was living in, for example, Tsai-Ming Liang films while living on the streets of Taiwan.

I can't help to philosophize while watching, not of art aesthetic, but of knowledge.

Japan, school and work is so artificial: both appear like offices.

It is always more interesting to watch films of places one is unfamiliar with. If one watches films that take place in corporate America, one doesn't realize it's even there.

An old thought: to choose media is uncreative. Why consume it in the first place? Does it really substitute an experience?

The family lives in a house, and schedules life by time, and forcing a schedule on their child. No external stimulus is at play. No time to play games.

Watching the life of house people is odd. What are they really doing? Following something they practiced, that society taught, or parents taught? How did they choose their current daily actions? Japanese people are so robotic. I wonder, did they always live in sepearate housing? Whereas South Asians lived together in large families? [I googled a good article to read]

Japanese people sure do have giant libraries. Perhaps the reason why their culture is so insular is because their consumption is so [harks negative affects of suburbs thought]. If one lives in a suburban house, one consumed what's in the house, not outside. What's inside is media: manga, cute books, Japanese movies, etc.

My view of life has quite changed. As I watch the film, I notice more. I see that the house exists. It's artificial. Their lives are determined by social interaction. Like watching people as I travel, I watch this film, the people at the wedding, my family. It is interesting to see what actions people take, rather than take action myself.

The family has an expensive DSLR, and the kid knows how to use it, without thinking of its affects or it's existence.

This film is fucking great, in pacing, tracking shots to provide thinking time, gestalts, setting.

The wife's mother highly regards people with money.

An idea from another person affected an individual, greatly.

It's quite similar to A Separation, in that an ethical argument is given, and portrayed realistically and masterfully.

Education, knowledge, social determinism, it's all here.

Which education is better? Planned or playful. Clearly playful environment. But the father shouldn't always act so childish to the kids, should he?

The grandmother feels the home is like a hotel, as do the other couple's kid. The amount of knowledge that pours from this film is more vast and succinct than that of most writers of the Western Canon.

"Don't you think that, for kids, giving them time is everything."

The father only realizes this now, after being raised in such a competitive society, he forgot the value of spending time. So isolated from life, so robotic.

Classic nature vs nurture debate.

The father is taking more part in the decision, although he spent far less time. A problem of gender inequality.

session two:
I just watched it as I did films in college, without philosophical analysis, profoundly.

"Spending time" is experience. Is it because I had little experience with my family, neither parent, I do not feel my parent's house is my home? My parent's first house was home because my friends lived on the same street. My parent's second house is not.

after the film [at a suburban home, alone]:
After watching the film I had a long dream of treating mom and documenting it. "Taking Mom to Taiwan". I would just record times I spend with her, showing a slow recovery from the negative symptoms of schizophrenia, and later piece then together with some transition scenes for time to contemplate between, like Koreeda's films. I was quite successful in the treatment, as she then lived a healthy life in Taiwan, with her own Indian food shop. We both went to some film festival and won. I hadn't told her about the film, and we just had fun and talked over the mic. I asked her a few serious questions for the audience, and she answered them. After that, I thanked a few Asian directors for their contemplative films, and Koreeda for being the impetus for the film, and Taiwan, for showing me life.

It seems, in the suburbs, I constantly substitute action with daydreaming.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[After watching a recent film by my favorite film director, I found on Wikipedia it was commended by the jury that awards the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prize_of_the_Ecumenical_Jury" title="Prize of the Ecumenical Jury">Prize of the Ecumenical Jury</a>. It is one of the juries of the Cannes Film festival with an objective to "honour works of artistic quality which witnesses to the power of film to reveal the mysterious depths of human beings through what concerns them, their hurts and failings as well as their hopes.". From my experience of the few films I've seen in the list, and of the many directors of films who've I've seen, it seems this is a great source of philosophy in film. After finding that, I decided to print it out and plaster it next to a few other syllabi I have for my temporary self-education.

I hope to continue to watch the rest of the films in the list, thinking deeply of the actions people take, how they came to decide it, the effects of external forces, and whatever other questions may arise.

Continuing the trend starting from <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/like-father-like-son" title="Like Father Like Son">the last film I had watched</a> of posting my thoughts, as opposed to reviewing a film, and forcing me to review my thoughts, edits appear in square brackets "[]", what follows are my thoughts during the viewing of Des hommes et des dieux (Of Gods and Men).

<strong>My Thoughts</strong>:
How do people form convents? Need a source: evangelists. Is just finding the bible enough for people to teach it? [Reminds me of a short story by Borjes in Ficciones]. This surely must have died in developed countries where internet is prevalent.

The priests read religious texts (Quran, St. Francis de Assisi, etc.), absolutely naive to dogmatic material.

The framing the in this and Like Father Like Son are varied. Sometimes faces takes a fourth of the screen. Sometimes the camera moves with transit or people walking. [Zoom is necessary. Stabilization not so, but nice to have.]

Life would have been quite different without the internet, and Wikipedia.

Religion and culture is always weird to me because they are dogmas. They don't make practical sense. Senseless traditions. It's amazing how much time people have to spend on these things. Neither have monetary value. Neither is real work: the movement of objects or knowledge [science].

These things (religion, culture, government) form because people are social [Aristotle], which later leads to the formation of laws.

The priests do their work, ignoring the world, like the father in the last film did his -- without play, following dogma. [Priests are like strict parents]

Film could be a great way to make an argument!

The priest choses not to take action (via reaction). A passive life?

So much time wasted while working [in the field or praying]. They could be listening to audiobooks!

If a religious armed person shares your own religion, you might be okay [safe], it seems.

This is another very good film of ethical decisions.

Both films do often use depth of field.

A progressive character in a convent? Interesting. I guess it's because he's the youngest. [It takes a habitual life over time to lose sight of progressivism]. Also interesting people sometimes desire to live outside of the convent, or at least the thought comes about during a dangerous time; During an earlier time in life, they decided to leave their homes to live a life "for Christ".

If one lives in such a style for 60 years, would one change to another? Only if one is forced to, or comes across some serious event to change one's mind.

Technology won't arrive there any time soon, neither would have many books.

The priests are very familial, caring for each other like mothers.

As a kid the youngest priest wanted to be a missionary. He must have been exposed to missionaries really early.

I read that these kinds of priests rarely idly talk. I think that adds to their conduciveness to dogmatic beliefs. Dialogue, is the social way of gaining intelligence, with peers, not ancient authorities.

Getting sleepy here...

It seems the main priest entails a bias in his speeches. Saying their actions [to stay at the convent] now matter, because their incarnations [does Christianity even have incarnation?] depend on it. Even another priest says it's okay to die -- "who ever saves their life shall die, whoever shall lose it preserves it". Well, I guess people use prayers to justify their actions?

They only give into pleasure when nearing death: wine and music. Such an awful life -- the disciplined one. [Perhaps it is only possible to live such a dull life with abstinence. And, perhaps, the abstinence of pleasure leads to a passive life, a lack of reaction, and therefore, action.] There are no bad effects to several kinds of pleasure. They react profoundly. So much emotional response from the music, an artificial stimulus.

The film gives good insight to the lives of these kinds of lifestyles though. [Buddhists may be compared to them.] 

Remote communities give opportunity to remote [guerilla-style] crimes. Guerrilla warfare almost requires far flung groups of people: easy targets.

Why don't people travel to cities? Some travel there for goods [one priest brought wine and cheese from what I believe is a place of higher population]. The priests wouldn't be needed if the village just transported to the city. Does this village provide goods for the city? Farming? Yeah, I guess that's the reason.

With the internet, farms must be an okay place to live now, maybe even nice for people who enjoy a quiet life. Still, a dangerous choice in life, and narrow in knowledge. Even with the internet, people are social animals, and if one limits their social life with people in their village, it limits their knowledge -- such an absurd phenomena. [todo: explore reasons for differences in amount of knowledge, if any, between cities and villages (I consider suburbs a contemporary form of a village)***]

The film is horrendously slow. Though, some ideas do require a lengthy experience to really digest. I could have read the synopsis of the film, but would I have similarly digested it? Perhaps I can try afterward. Perhaps it's similar to reading a book and it's synopsis: one doesn't have much material and time (pacing), to formulate why things happened.

The subject of the film is why each priest made the decision (if any) to stay. What's not shown is the other side of decision-making: the insurgents. Did each of the insurgents decide to follow people who making unethical killings? Perhaps there was even less brain activity on their side.

Though not much communication exists between the priests, they are intelligent, especially found in the testament by Christian given at the end of the film. He knows how discrimination lead to conflicts; He loves the country and it's people, even if they kill him. Perhaps an exemplar of non-violence. [the first communication between the insurgents was a very good example of non-violent communication, and it was successful]

Hah, Amadee lived for another 12 years, indeed outliving them all.

Further watching: Battle of Algiers.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This is just a short thought from today, which rambled into meaningless gibberish because I am sleepy.

If a person's goal is to gain a lot of knowledge, then an efficient way of quickly gaining it is worth considering.

In the past I made <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/nomadism-culture-and-the-playful-quest-for-knowledge">a personal post about a way of living</a>, progressive education [todo: books are dead], but I this post covers learning fundamentally, the transfer of knowledge.

Let's start with two methods: boring and fun.

The boring method:
Either one's genes evolved to tolerate this or one was raised in the same environment as the academia of ancient greeks.

The stereotype academic life, steeped in Wikipedia, and perhaps, books. Higher education. Sometimes talks with peers at school, but mostly habitually robotically consuming information from printed material. The life of Kant, Einstein, Chomsky, and what I imagine of most intellectuals. Routine to a desk full of open books and computer screens.

Life and learning:
Though the goal is to learn, it misses the other part: living life; "to live and learn". The complete goal is to maximize learning while living (having new experiences).

My life:
My History of Learning. [todo: need to write a short blog about my personal history of learning. How grow in an entirely artificial world grasping concepts without knowledge that they're learning, and it's not limited to books. Not knowing what philosophy was while constantly thinking about it. Watching a lot of films when Netflix was created. Reading Wikipedia for everything I didn't know.]

An ideal future:
As the world adds ever more content in ever more an organized manner, people learn more than ever before. Perhaps people aren't smarter, instead, the materials of learning is better.

Two improvements: The media is aesthetically pleasing, and most of the media is interactive, meant to be played with others.

Life is generally fun and educational. One is living and learning what they wish. People are constantly interacting in ways to gain or explore knowledge. It is not connected to an institution of any sort. All media is available for everyone. Naturally, people will gather in public spaces to play the media. People will meet others. Perhaps they will become friends and meet regularly. Perhaps some of the people who play will go play somewhere else with other people to gain knowledge (There is no external social force to play in one place or time). Some people play at night, some during the day. Some find it's better to play with a different group of people every day to mixing media and people. Some people like to replay past media on one day, and new media on the others. Some play alone.

The media people play sometimes correlate with their current work, so if a workplace exists, that kind of media can often be played with those people, providing a gestalts effect.

... hmmm more to explore here, lol.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I feel there is an association to public spaces and action.

By public spaces I'm mostly thinking of anywhere outside of a building, inside of a city: streets, parks, and plazas.

The lack of private space, lack of media, vicinity of people and nature, and the resulting stimulation from the two, is all conducive action.

Just being the in public in a city offers so much external stimuli. The more dense, people and materials, the more stimulation. If there are things to interactive with, then one is likely to do so: buy something, play an arcade or board game, talk to people.

The more interactive the space, the likely people will take action. To make a space more interactive, there should be things to play with and tools to make things with. The higher the variety of things, the more diverse the crowd [not sure about this sentence, just writing my mind]

If one has been exposed to aesthetics, and intends to create something, the mass amount of stimulation should flow in tons of ideas.

If one is constantly exposed to massive amounts of stimulation, one may not be able to make sense of the world, seeing it as a disorganized mass of data, and find it absurd to take any kind of action.

Welp, that turned out to be a very short thought.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[aka What Does Media Want?

[todo: grab info from <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/learning-in-the-information-age" title="Learning in the Information Age">Learning in the Information Age</a> and delete it]

A random thought.

Not really in the beginning, there was man. Man took in the world of information as any other animal would, responding instinctively. If the man was lucky, he had parents, or a social group to follow and learn how to deal with the world. Man was the first thing to organize knowledge.

Later, he was able to able to turn objects into words. If the man was lucky, he had older people to give him more words. Man with words may have been able to organize more knowledge, because one can't always point at objects.

Later, he was able put words into objects. Objects became knowledgeable! Whoa.

The first of which was writing. Until modern times, people used written material as their secondary source of organized knowledge. The first being oral language, unless one lived a cruel childhood.

The second was picture. Pictures perhaps illustrated complex ideas and machinations during ancient times; an example: maths. More recently, it's possible kids grew up reading comic books (or manga), during their knowledge-formative years.

The third, moving pictures. Soon after comic books blew up, television and films pervaded to provide a constant view of reality, or a poorly acted one, through streams of video. Most kids do experience a lot of this during their formative years.

The fourth, games. Games resemble less of a medium and more back to the original way knowledge was transmitted, before oral and written languages: through human interaction, play.

The last is an mix of mediums: the internet. It includes all of the above mediums, but limits it to a screen.

<blockquote><2/9/12
Perhaps why I prefer film, or even comic book to books is because they display more information in less time.

Or perhaps I need to read faster.</blockquote>

As information becomes more organized, people learn faster. This renders older forms of media less useful. The medium that most closely resembles reality will usually be more efficient in transmitting knowledge.

That is, given an equal amount of time and relatively equal content, the child who reads books will understand less than that of one that watches film, and even less than that who learns everything with a kind tutor.

Each time a new medium is found, people put their knowledge into it. Bless them. For I do not believe that people would have as much knowledge as they do now without those kind, caring people.

<blockquote>2/9/12 (?, well some time in New York)
I haven't played/beat a full video game since college. Why? Because there is no new knowledge or philosophy to be gained from it. I wonder if I'll get bored of films too...then only books will be left.</blockquote>

Though it is more pleasurable to start from media that most closely replicates experience and go backward, unfortunately, it's only been a century since more modern mediums have existed or been preserved, and all of the knowledge of books, and certainly Wikipedia, have not been organized into the modern mediums.

Though in the defense of games, humanities is not the only thing games are good for.

[does this belong to this post?]
<blockquote>11/28/2014
The closer to real experience, the more powerful the reaction.</blockquote>

In addition to being more pleasurable, <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/the-most-powerful-forms-of-art" title="The Most Powerful Forms of Art">it is more powerful</a>, in its ability to incite reaction.

The more powerful a media, the more influence it has on people.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>What makes a classic, classic?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In answering this question, one comes closer to what one should focus on creating.

Though for each medium (or new media) there are steps in aesthetics that accumulate to what makes a modern example of that medium, the steps are often forgotten.

What makes a classic are those things that offer a perspective of life, and allows time to reflect on it.

As I've mentioned before, my favorite films are the slow, contemplative ones by Asians: Still Walking, Like Father Like Son, Yi Yi, Tokyo Story. These films capture families realistically, allowing the viewer to observe human condition.

Those aren't just my favorites, there are more that I consider classics. My favorites happen to have nuclear families as their subject, but it isn't limited to such. Other films I'd still consider classics: Tree of Life, Apu trilogy, Chop Shop, 400 Blows, La Haine, Vive L'Amour, 4 Months 3 Weeks 2 Days, Nobody Knows, Grave of Fireflies, Bicycle Thieves, Ikiru, Kiki's Delivery Service, Certified Copy, A Separation. All of these films contain people. They too portray life realistically and explore the human condition.

It seems to me that's it. <strong>A classic is an art object that realistically portrays life and deeply explores the human condition.</strong> To have good aesthetics (design, pacing, style) are icing.

I have not read classic fiction books, but I imagine the following novels of realism do similar justice: Anne Karrenina, War and Peace, Madame Bovary, Middlemarch, The Brothers Karamazov, Crime and Punishment.

Video games vary, and I have not experienced one that offers nearly as much insight into human life as the other mediums, but it's possible. Jason Rohrer's early games are a start. Jonathan Blow's Braid had a good character. Anna Anthropy's Dys4ia is the greatest example I can currently think of. All are linear experiences. Still, none compare. But there are many other directions for games. When art is an interaction, it can't be duplicated, which is kind of a requirement of a classic, that it can be re-experienced.

New media, performance art, public art, interactive art, etc. are different beasts They usually serve as steps by pushing aesthetics forward (Duchamp), from object to experience (Fluxus), from experience to interaction (Fluxus again?), and so on. Once they become interactive, they follow the same fate as interactive games: unable to become a classic. Ai Wei Wei's work and Banksy just don't quite fit or compare to those classic films or books. [I may be missing some classic performance arts, such as plays and dance] 

I may argue for Brandon Stanton's Humans of New York photograph and text series, and Vincent Moon's music and performance video series, as they provide insight into humans too. Both are archived on the internet, so it is possible to see it all in one viewing, as one normally does classics.

Of recent note, I found the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prize_of_the_Ecumenical_Jury">Prize of the Ecumenical Jury</a> within the Cannes film festival with this stated goal: "honour works of artistic quality which witnesses to the power of film to reveal the mysterious depths of human beings through what concerns them, their hurts and failings as well as their hopes." Their goal is great, but their films tend to be more philosophical.

Also of recent note, one of Calvino's definitions of a classic that I like: "A classic is the term given to any book which comes to represent the whole universe, a book on a par with ancient talismans." This represents the childish ideal all art strives for.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It seems I've transformed into a house and computer person who can consume films now. Some people think if one doesn't have the attention to read a large book that the person is dumb. I contend, one who experiences media and reflects on it, as opposed to reality, has no life. Currently, I have no life.

On to the film.

I will first go over my thoughts [in square brackets], and afterwards some afterthoughts.

<strong>My thoughts</strong>:
The camcorder in the beginning will look like my cheap camcorder. :(

The neighborhood reminds me of the neighborhood of the hostel in Seoul.

The couple spends a lot of time inside the house. They cook at home with an expensive kitchen. They have a huge library of books, and perhaps film.

They drink red wine. Do they think about what it took to make it?

The family reminds me of that one in Like Father Like Son. Their house like a hotel. The kid must be schooled in geometry and swimming. What use? Habit?

Hah there's a TV show. Why take the time to create such a superficial room? Quite similar to the couple's living room.

The interaction between neighbors is missing. Perhaps they don't even know their neighbors.

A magnificent scene with a dark skinned guy with ambiguous fault. [Equally ambiguous is Georges reaction, whether he reacted that way because the other guy was dark or not]

This kind of paranoia occurs in the western, isolated world.

Perhaps France still has these kinds of problems, of hate, racism or whatever else, but after it developed, they still occur, so these problems seem a bit more odd, and scary [Whoa, I think I nailed it here. Clearly a post-colonial stigma.]. The neighborhood is normally empty, the opposite of villages.

Such a simple action, a tape, letters, provokes so much emotion [I was thinking compared to happier countries or denser cities where one may just disregard it and trash it. It's just material, not a person, sort of thought.]

Fear broods in spaces without people and light.

Such small details in this film and Certified Copy and A Seaparation count, and become exacerbated.

All of these lives, in houses, so odd. They experience so little, except perhaps through books.

Overworking in a developed country, seems to be the trend.

"Isn't it lonely if you can't go out? Is it less if you can sit in a garden?"

"Do you feel less lonely at the metro than at home?"

Oh man, such ethical inquiry.  My parents live in a rich neighborhood in the suburbs where they don't know the neighbors. Though not an estate, to me it's a prison compared to a city. Ive asked these same questions to my mom. She didn't retort as successfully as this. I personally feel less lonely in the public.]

"Anyway, I have my family friend. With a remote control. When it annoys me, I shut it down."

Television replaces human interaction. Or any interaction, TV is still a one way communication.

His father played piano. His son prefers to hang out.

A criticism of modern times, and the lack of attention, and rigorous practice.

"Getting old... Lights off? No."
Hallucinatory visions?

Even the mother lives in a lonely place. Such craziness only exists without much people.

Hah the use of camcorder video intertwining with the real film is so good. Perhaps horror has done this before, but not this well.

Hmm only VHS tapes, and no GPS to check the street name. Perhaps the film can only exist 10 years ago, like No Country for Old Men. Making a film now is too complex [to get around technology].

What makes these films so great is that the characters are smart, complex. They know justice. [They know human values.]

Revenge? And on the other side, guilt. Such a simple concept that harks the mind even at such late ages. [At the time of thinking this, I also thought about New Guineans exacting revenge in tribal warfare because I was reading a book about it.]

Only a guilty person would have gone to the room.

Hmm, another film that deals with the Algerian War, the other being Of Gods and Men I saw within the past week, though, this is only referenced as something done in the past. Perhaps French filmmakers have experienced this themselves and feel strongly about it. [Haneke is indeed quite old and lived during the time. From the Wikipedia article of the mentioned incident in the film, The Paris Massacre of 1961: "After 37 years of denial, in 1998 the French government acknowledged 40 deaths, although there are estimates of over 200." The theme of denial is alluded to.]

Oh man, such good comparison to invasion [colonization?] of Iraq. [Mmm, another colonization thought. Well, this one was an obvious allusion via televised news. As an American-born watching this, it did make it feel more relatable, modern.]

"We will ensure greater homogeneity."
This is frightening. Not just this line, but the film. [Was that news report real? Homogeneity in Iraq?]

Only in Western countries does so much paranoia occur. Though part of he film is to build horror, knowing where the child is at all times is probably their [the couple's] normal routine.

So much work (bills) for the father, and junk (media, toys, posters) in the child's room.

"If you're alone you'll imagine the worst."
That's a good friend. She <em>did</em> immediately think of her son getting hit by a car.

Whoa, this film...

It's so good that the film takes place while the characters maintain a normal life, or try to. Work is shown. Raising a child. So much going on.

Rimbaud
An allusion I'm unaware of, but like Watchmen, every frame of this film matters.

Rimbaud was a poet in his teens, then stopped [making poems], considered a libertine. A Libertine is one devoid of most moral restraints, especially one who ignores or even spurns accepted morals. [Now that's a frightening concept!] Libertines put value on physical pleasures, those through senses. [hmm, that's fascinating, to see where senses and rational must be balanced]. It grew adherents in 17th, 18th, and 19th century France and Great Britian. France sure was a fucked up place. In French novel Dangerous Lessons, the term a dish served best cold was coined, and is considered an early example of Libertine literature. The genre ended with the French Revolution. [what a frightening time, need to Wikipedia Napoleon]. Back to Rimbaud: "Rimbaud was known to have been a libertine and a restless soul. He traveled extensively on three continents before his death from cancer just after his thirty-seventh birthday." Ooof, reading Rimbaud's biography on Wikipedia, there are some comparisons of a strict childhood. "I'm now making myself as scummy as I can. Why? I want to be a poet, and I'm working at turning myself into a seer. You won't understand any of this, and I'm almost incapable of explaining it to you."..."The idea is to reach the unknown by the derangement of all the senses. It involves enormous suffering, but one must be strong and be a born poet. It's really not my fault." Whoa, what a fascinating life. Lots to learn in his actions.

Orphanages breed hatred? Explains revenge.

Those early scenes of guilt and conscience were brilliant.

His mother sleeps with the lights on, but he doesn't.

Meh, these films are too serious. I'd rather chill in Taiwan, without a worry in the world. Except finance and my Chinese. [lol, I was quite scared by the end of it.]

I don't think it's healthy for any life to be solely based on media. It really could damage a formative mind. Good thing I rode my bike all day and still do.

Oh man. The screenplay. Christ it's brilliant.

The father sleeps, a scene plays in which his parents send Majid to the orphanage, for which most of the time I had mistaken it for the protagonist and his wife.

The end, also brilliant, not in a cheesy way in which films revolve, though it does. Masjid's sons tells the protagonists son something, perhaps placing a conscience on him about his father.

<strong>After the film</strong>:
I was just amazed at how tight the screenplay was, reminding me of A Separation.

Even more, I was amazed by the allusions all over the place. Allusions not just from the television news or even the dialogue about Rimaud, and all the other allusions I missed -- I didn't quite fit in the dog story in my head at the time -- but also the allusions of standard dialog from characters. Every piece of dialog in the film had reason to be there, held weight, symbolism, constantly richening the experience.

The deep, slow shots allow the mind to take in more content, allowing the eyes to wander, whilst reflecting.

Just in <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/what-makes-a-classic-classic">my last blog post</a>, I mentioned the criteria for what makes a classic classic, and this not just meets those, but exceeds them.

I've mentioned before a comparison to Watchmen. Watchmen was a powerful piece of media for me, with its abundance of allusions in every frame, on the frames nearby, symbolism in the chapter, and in the entire novel, constantly interacting with other parts, the details form complex ideas over time. This film similarly accomplishes that, with its allusions, aphorism-filled dialogs, symbolism, interacting and fitting any part of the film, ignoring time, transcending.

<strong>Interpretations</strong>:

I instinctively read <a href="http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-cache-2005">Roger Ebert's review</a>, which lead to his <a href="http://www.rogerebert.com/rogers-journal/cach%C3%A9-a-riddle-wrapped-in-a-mystery-inside-an-enigma">in-depth answer</a> to the film.

Upon reading his review, he mentioned Tuberculosis being a disease in which people cough up blood. I did not know that, but fits. And I wondered, what if the person coughing blood was Georges, making him have TB. I read Wikipedia, and one has "fevers, chills, night sweats, fatigue." All of which Michael had during the film. Well, that's ambiguous, he could have just been in a poor mood. Anyway, it just made me think, Georges had TB, and through guilt, his hallucinatory visions put Majid in his place. Furthermore, his mother is dying too, perhaps of latent TB? A fun thought.

Upon looking at a scene around where Ebert mentioned, after the coughing blood scene, when Georges and his son go to the car, the son waves some plants out of the way, or, does he place a camera? Hah, then I've become paranoid, over-scrutinizing.

After reading the more in-depth review, it makes a lot of sense that the two sons knew each other. At first, I thought Majid's son intentionally met afterward, now I'm going toward the former.

In the comments of the reviews, others have formed their own great ideas:

an example:
<blockquote>Did anyone notice the movie posters/ads at around 01:26 into the movie? Ma Mere (My mother)& Deux Freres (Two Brothers)? Was Majid G's half brother? Were M's "parents" sent away at a convenient time in France's history so his real mother could adopt him without raising questions.

When G visits his mother she pretends to not remember M. She is visibly upset. M knew G's mother was ill. M had contact with her.
M says later "WHAT WOULDN'T WE DO NOT TO LOSE WHATS OURS". G to go from single child to have to share. W to be an outsider and to do anything to please. G exploited M's need to belong to be rid of him. How much did G hear when he was a child? Enough to know M was more than adopted?

Majid is forgiving Georges.

M just wants his family. G can't let go of the lies and may believe them. Is G racist? A snob?

Majid's son must have contacted P. They both planned to reunite their fathers. Their grandmother is dying? Majid's son and P tried to bring some peace to both brothers. G refused to see. W would never have his family. So much denial and sadness. No peace for G without the sleeping pills. No family for M ever.</blockquote>

A more encompassing example:
<blockquote>Okay, I think I have figured out Ebert's "Shooting Gun" based on POV, as well as an ALL ENCOMPASSING solution to the mystery (until you all put a dozen holes through it).

The POV in the shot at about the 20 minute mark before the 'boy with blood' memory has two characteristics: 1) It is a still shot, implying that is is the objective perspective from someone filming, and 2) It is from a second story level at the street leading right up to George's front door.

Therefore, Ebert is implying that the person making the tapes was taping from the second floor of George's house (i.e. Pierrot).

Additionally, even if it a Subjective POV shot, it is still coming from a member of George's household and aimed directly at the spot from which the opening frames of the movie are being filmed. In other words, Pierrot is looking from his bedroom window at the spot from where they are being filmed and knows where the camera is before his parents tell him of the tapes.

(However, unlike Ebert I am not convinced that POV is the solution, because anyone could have been looking from out of that window, out of pure fear, not neccessarily knowledge. They know they are being filmed from that general direction. And if Ebert means the POV of the person seeing the bleeding boy, it seems to be the POV of someone the height of age six, so it had to be George's POV from memory and no one else.)

One issue not discussed anywhere of vital imprtance to solving the mystery is that George is a dedicated liar and never reveals what actually happened between him and Majid, although there are two hints: 1) After killing the rooster Majid appears to approach George with violent intent holding up the axe when the scene suddenly ends, and 2) George tells Majid something to the effect of "You were older and stronger than me, I had no choice". Therefore, what did George do? Was it much more violent than what George finally admits to his wife at the end of the movie? It had to be when he says he was older and stonger and had no choice. George probably beat the living crap out of him and caused him to bleed for days on end, which he has suppressed in his memory as "spontaneous bleeding". George doesn't appear to admit to much and is obviously hiding a lot more as implied from the two scenes just mentioned, which is why it is such a painful memory for the Grandmother. It must have been a lot more violent and the family had to send Majid away for his own safety after brushing the family violence under the carpet, and bringing a doctor in to check the boy after waiting for exterior wounds to heal. Kid's skin wounds heal fast, it could have been a wait of only one or two weeks.

One other issue not mentioned by bloggers which is part of the solution is that Majid may actually be George's brother conceived through an affair between the Grandmother and the Algerian farmhand. This would explain the desire to adopt him and the guilt caused by exiling him at a young age and the mysterious dissappearance of both parents. This theory is based on the fact that Waleed (Majid's son) appears to be in touch with the Grandmother and knows about her health. Why if he is he in touch with her does the Grandmother claim to have no memory of him? Something stinks there to high heaven. The only reason they would be in touch is due to a blood or a continuing adoptive relationship.

In any case the story George tells is very very innocent and could not be the cause of so much trauma on Majid's part and so much guilt on George's part. His only admission is that he said "I saw him bleeding" and "I told him to kill a rooster". Hell, on a farm there is a lot of chicken killing going on.

Majid would only kill himself in that gruesome fashion due to very serious childhood trauma, not just being sent away to boarding school.

I don't think we can say who sent the films, but we can determine who made the films for one good reason: No one had access to Majid's house to film the confrontation between George and Majid except Majid's family. Therefore, Either Majid made the tapes, or his son did (independently or in cohoots with Pierrot, it doesn't matter)

Finally, the second generation seems to know each other based on the closing shot. Majid's son and Pierrot have some kind of positive relationship. Perhaps Majid's son approached him at school and made friends with him. Whether they are in league with one another or not is not important...</blockquote>

For a film to form interpretations of what happened in its entirety is a feat, even more so than Certified Copy, in which one turns into the other.

At the end of the same comment:
<blockquote>...The point of the movie is that there is a silver lining on the history of violence betwen France and Algeria, led by a new generation that is able to look past racial differences. Pierrot's hero is none other than Algerian Zinedine Zidane who led France to its last World Cup and has his poster hanging on his bedroom wall. This generation can look past racial differences; Pierrot can have a good relationship with Majid's son, although we cannot imagine that George's generation can have an honest relationship with their colonized neighbours.</blockquote>

And for a film to <em>simultaneously</em> hold these symbolisms with strength is an unimaginable feat.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We receive data sensually. What we make of the data depends on what we have in the mind, and its current state.

person <-- data

For a great amount of time, especially during the information age, people are consuming organized information via a medium [ordered from least sensual to most]: written language (books), visual language (films, observing), written and visual (the internet), play (games, interactions in life).

person <-- medium <-- data

Because people have become conditioned to receive organized data through mediums, they too restrict their creativity to the medium.

person --> idea + data --> known medium

That's limiting. The world is full of disorganized data. The way we organize it is a conceptual process. New media explores this.

person --> idea + data --> unknown medium (including performance and interaction)

The more divergent the data of the unknown product, yet still maintaining an idea the better the aesthetic. The more the unknown product explores knowledge (science, humanities) the better the education. The more sensual the unknown product the more pleasurable it becomes and the faster data is transmitted.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[thoughts from near the beginning of moving to Taiwan:
<blockquote>Everything can be done locally. The neighborhood is very important. The more traditional, the better. No commute. Just walk outside. It's beautiful.</blockquote>

I feel there is an association between happiness and public spaces.

Countries with traditional markets, a kind of public place, as a rather large part of life -- Taiwan, Southeast Asia (Thailand, Vietnam*, Cambodia* [maybe Loas]), Nepal, Northeast India, Morocco*, Mexico*, seem to be happier. Most, maybe all of them have two kinds of markets: one an outdoors market of farmer's produce and the other for shopping (or strolling) manufactured goods and eating, a simple way to satisfy pleasure.

Taiwan furthers the eating part by creative new kinds of food (in addition to new kinds of manufactured goods) which also satisfies the feeling of doing something new. Taiwan also furthers the strolling part with windowed pet stores.

And countries that have parks. Here people sit, talk, play music, have local drinks or food. Older people can be found here all day, sometimes playing board games, other times drinking and talking. It's better than retirement homes.

In Taiwan, neighborhoods are built in ways to incorporate small parks every few blocks with assorted seats, playgrounds, and funny exercise instruments.

Nepal has large public plazas, it serves the same purpose as parks, but in a less natural way. But one cannot simply destroy those ancient beautiful plazas.

In Korea, beside the large rivers that run through major cities, and near the coasts, a kind of plaza exists, where people can buy or fish(!) seafood and eat by the water.

In Taiwan, Korea, and Japan, there is no law restricting people from drinking alcohol outside. In the college areas, there is often a popular park where kids buy drinks from a nearby convenient store and drink. Such a folly of Western law.

Convenient stores! Not really a public space, but, it has a relationship with them, more than just drinking alcohol. People buy food, cigarettes, and whatever else, sitting outside them, or at the night market, or at a park. They satisfy the more malign needs, including instant noodles. East Asia probably has the highest amount of convenient store density per area; It probably has the highest rational index.

Humans need to satisfy their desires. Having a public place is such a simple way to do so. It allows people to meet, socialize (and oh do people from these countries love to talk!), eat, and shop.

The more per area, the less likely doing something bad (materialism, drugs, prostitution, clubs, bars, etc.) to satisfy desire. Bars, and in a socially alienated way, clubs, are just public spaces commoditized. Malls are corporate night markets.

The bourgeoisie social norms of Western civilization newly found in Eastern civilization perhaps taught through media can be found in the downtown areas of large cities in the forms of clubs, high-class restaurants, and bars. It's highly likely the people that go there are either Western in origin, or rich and took action according to media that influenced them. The public spaces weren't enough, and they wanted more. There's no way of stopping them from going there, they have cars to skip to there destination, ignoring all of the satisfaction found en route. Even with the traffic of the bridge between New Jersey and New York, people will still wait through traffic, park at an expensive garage, wait at a line to get into a club, pay a fee to get inside, and pay extraordinary amounts to buy a drink. Well, now this is digressing. I guess I'll have to leave foot versus car life in another blog post, or read The Death and Life of Great American Cities.

The bourgeoisie social norms of Eastern civilization is not as bad as the West. It's usually just eating expensive food at a restaurant for a long period of time. Karaoke instead of clubs. Having a car is a luxury.

This kinda digressed, but I just wanted to see if I could somehow associate the generally higher happiness of these countries, which I greatly felt, with public spaces.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Though Wolf Children (おおかみこどもの雨と雪, Ōkami Kodomo no Ame to Yuki) isn't on the the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prize_of_the_Ecumenical_Jury">Prize of the Ecumenical Jury list</a>, it was on my personal list, because I loved Mamoru Hosoda's last two films, Summer Wars and the Girl who Leapt through Time. And after watching the film, I think it belongs to that list. Watching this film and <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/like-father-like-son" title="Like Father Like Son">Like Father Like Son</a> is good for the brain.

During the viewing of this film, I was sleep deprived, perhaps on my 22nd hour of the day, and in a terrible state: I've imprisoned myself in a house for three months now and lost weight [underweight]. Perhaps because of this long-term isolation, the viewing was more immersive. I left relatively few thoughts.

Surprisingly, there were many thoughts on human nature. The main plot device is a symbolism of two kinds.

<strong>Thoughts</strong>:
<blockquote>Scenes of different places from different lengths and angles go by quickly to show routine life. Such simple yet powerful technique.</blockquote>
The scenes here are of the mother's life. It showed contemporary city life in Japan really well. It reminded me of how in five minutes or less Pixar films accomplish the same feat, especially that in the film Up and the short film (not Pixar) La Maison en Petits Cubes. It only takes a few minutes to show an entire life and grab the viewer in a somewhat romantic way.

<blockquote>Japanese people, so proper.</blockquote>
Hah, it's always interesting to see how formal, rational, Japanese people are. I imagine this is the general view from Western civilization.

<blockquote>"Overcoming obstacles", instead of just feely saying or doing something.</blockquote>
This is another observation of Japanese culture. Perhaps the translation just sounds funny and sticks out because of it, but in many times in other Japanese media, people use "overcoming obstacles" to many very dire situations, especially when coming of age. It sounds trite to me, but it also fits the trend of parents in Japan over-worrying about their kids.

<blockquote>Such a lonely life: Living in an apartment. The father dreams of having a bookcase in a tiny apartment. Their only satisfaction of desire comes from home-cooked food. No fun? No family? No friends?</blockquote>
Another observation of how rational Japanese culture is. The mother's life seemed so robotic. Home, work, cook, read. It showed very little irrational satisfactions. It's possible some books were hentai, but even then, it's so controlled.

<blockquote>The law isn't friendly to animals, people are afraid of breaking rational social norms, which animal's actions do.</blockquote>
and a later thought:
<blockquote>Wolves can be a symbolism for any kind of problem unusual to society.</blockquote>
The law represented in the film by some health department checking children's shots. The mother is pressured by the law to leave society.

Also, then neighbors are don't accept the barking noises.

There's a great scene where the mother wants to hide her kids from the public. I made me think of how mothers with handicap children feel.

<blockquote>Environment, city versus nature.</blockquote>
and
<blockquote>One more human, one more animal</blockquote>
Obvious, but nice to see the spectrum of rational versus irrational (passionate, creative, etc.) in both humans and environment.

[Update:] I just had the thought: it's interesting that they partially grew up in the apartment. The boy desired home for many of his young years because he grew up in a home environment, only adjusting later. The girl grew up a wolf. It seems the boy represents nurture and the girl, nature.

<blockquote>Cause and effect.</blockquote>
I often think about cause and effect more nowadays. How seeing a guy led to a baby, led to being shunned by society, led to living a hard life on the farm. The mother's actions were very rational, a grand success. At no point did the film turn malign. The mother didn't abandon her children as shown well in Nobody Knows and from a different cause in Grave of Fireflies. The film never explores nuances in reality, where small decisions and actions have huge effects. Overall, it just follows an optimistic path of a normal good life, a life we are familiar with through most media.

<blockquote>Spending so much time building a home, oh the joy of simple living.</blockquote>
This may have been two separate thoughts, I can't tell by my handwriting.

The mother spends a lot of time cleaning the house the first time, and several times after the children mess it up. I often feel people spend too much time cleaning the house. If the kids spend more time outside, in nature (or cities) or school (or work), the house shouldn't matter much. People in America spend a lot of money renovating their houses or apartments. Often, it's just a past-time. There isn't a real reason behind it. One can survive with a lot less. So, it's alway weird for me to see how much time people spend on houses, as opposed to experience. Though, in this case, the mother spends the right amount of time.

<blockquote>Books for education.</blockquote>
Though one can learn from books, the film must take place at a time where computers were less prominent. It's interesting to see how the mother is able to stick to a rigid routine of learning through books, an outdated form of education. If it were taken place in modern times, one could easily just have used a smartphone and do research on wolves and local fauna and plants, and farming. Earlier in the film, they were learning Greek philosophy. Though, I really loved the book truck that came later. That's a new concept to me!

<blockquote>All education from mother.</blockquote>
Well, I guess not all, as the daughter does go to school. But in the primary years, all formal education comes solely from the mother, and nature. For the son, all of his form education <em>is</em> from his mother.

I always felt nature should be a large part of early education. There's a lot that can form in one's mind given time to play in nature.

It seems like quite a lot of burden from a mother to be the sole human of all education for her children. It's just wild to think that all human knowledge is passed down from her to her children. It's normal, but here it feels primal. Also, I feel Japanese families are generally more nuclear, perhaps reinforced by the small apartments. More emphasis on the nuclear family as opposed to public societies. 

It's also nice to see the boy not attend school at such an early age and go into nature. In America, the normal age is after high school, or after college. I always felt sometime after elementary school seems to be right. A good symbolic nod for progressive education, if the child feels so.

<blockquote>Instinctual pleasure from manual labor.</blockquote>
An effect of living closer to nature. It's nice to see the children have pleasure running in the wild near their farmhouse and the mother working hard, though, seemingly, enjoying it. It harked the thought that humans desire direct pleasures often, which can be as simple was walking in nature, and how middle class society denies them of it, especially the city culture of Japan. A representative scene was in the city apartment, when the daughter would get angry (and therefore turn into wolf) when she wanted to go walk.

After an education from home,

<blockquote>Four years, no people. Amazing.</blockquote>
It's astonishing to see how the kids, well, at least the daughter adapted to society after four or so years of living only in the company of their family. In most societies, there are at least one of the following: extended families, kids on the street, friends. But there are those more sheltered households, so I guess it's not so bad. During the viewing, it was astonishing for me, to see so many people, and to see the artificial environment it took place in. Not as frightening as a city though, as the pre-school was not far from the farmhouse. A good step.

<blockquote>Hah, was nice to see that the daughter started as a wolf, then grew more human, and the son the other way around.</blockquote>
This is probably common; I may have fit the boy's fate.

<blockquote>Though often over-dramatic similar to the director's previous works, it does explore human ethics, especially the theme of rational versus instinct [irrational], and I imagine this is more difficult in a megacity of Japan, the heart of middle-class discontent.</blockquote>
This thought was followed by:
<blockquote>A great plot device. It enabled the film to explore the core theme through several situations.</blockquote>
And lastly:
<blockquote>It is frightful how I die / do nothing without social stimulus. Without the city, without a need for money, I stop. With travel and civilization, I thrive.</blockquote>

I am not sure if these were during the film or at the end of it. For the most part, as I said, I watched without thought, without any deep analysis.

I agree, the film is aesthetically the same as the last two: anime. It even had a few scenes that reminded me of Akira, when 3d-generated thingies were new and cool. They were rather weird, unfitting to me. Nothing new in aesthetics. Though, there were some beautiful scenes that depicted contemporary life in a Japanese city. In animations, I often think how odd it is to put so much work to mimic real life; I mean, if one spends the time to make an animation, then it should explore some fantastic element that a real production can't, to further aesthetics. Hosoda's films do this, just slightly, perhaps just right, making the films still feel real. A lot of work put into the animation, as usual.

The film is indeed over-dramatic and therefore feels inauthentic. I feel the worst was done with the blaring dramatic music. That's a shame.

It is interesting to see how Japanese people constantly churn out media that explore the nature, not human nature, but natural earth so much. Surely this must be a yearning from living in such artificial places.

The plot device indeed is great. I'm sure it was used in past media several times: man as animal, but I don't remember it being used this well, in contemporary society, as opposed to some wild fantasy or science fiction.

The last thought, as I said, represents my current poor state. I'm currently in a suburb, not even represented in the film, and not worth being. The city provides people, the farm provides nature. The suburbs provide neither.

I remember watching The Girl Who Leapt Through Time, twice. Once the next day. I even spent some time looking at other people's timelines. I wanted to spend more time with the film. I loved it. Similarly here, I want to watch it again. There is something alluring about Hosada's films. Is it because there is more to learn from it? Is it because it contains ideals, which helps me make better current decisions? Or is it the simple pleasures of life that I desire? I don't know, but it's an exceptional thing. I've only watched a handful of films twice, and Hosada has accomplished in creating this feeling, thrice.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It is unusual if one grew up learning aesthetics through textbooks.

I grew up with games, then films, then new media, in that order. I learned what made them aesthetically good by experiencing them, always gradually gravitating toward newer (to me) aesthetic ideas. I learned of new media only once I moved to cities because they only exist there. They're not circulated around the world as films, games, and books are.

Once an aesthetic idea is learned, it sticks. Any later experienced implementation of the same idea is outdated. For example, I read Watchmen first, the rest of comic books (including grpahic novels), seem outdated.

When one creates, the learned aesthetic ideas mingle. That is the wrong way to go about <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/a-design-strategy-for-data" title="A Design Strategy for Data">creating</a>.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[With today's technology, it doesn't seem the cost of teaching is much.

I would think a few laptops, internet, a secure public place, and a watchman who can teach how to use the computer to learn suffices. If the people do not know a language, then the teacher must teach them just enough language to use the computer for them self-learn. Perhaps there should be a liberal curriculum too, mainly taught through Wikipedia. For advanced peoples, OpenCourseware. Every populated place should have such a space.

I think curious people would naturally be attracted to it.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>10/9/13
Kim Ki Duk's films barely have any words. Language is unnecessary.</blockquote>

In the gaining of knowledge, I believe verbal language is inferior to visual. One is visually aware once as a baby opens their eyes, knowledge pours through, ideas are conveyed instantly, faster than language ever could have. Verbal language comes much later. 

I think this is the reason my personal history went as so: biking, playing video games, watching films (supplemented with Wikipedia) in college, then living and working in cities, and later, abroad, then finally listening to audiobooks.

[Stopping here. I imagine more thoughts will lead me here again.]

I'm alone again, wondering the city. It's hot, I overeat...</blockquote>

<blockquote>10/10/13
I think it was simply the heat that drove me insane. I need to stay focused, even in the heat. Buy a cheap cap. Find my safari hat. Take water. Avoid eating.</blockquote>

Heat is a sensual experience, and it causes one to do things. For one, to get something cold to drink or drink for homeostasis.

Further, it sure does feel that heat causes action, maybe even a bit more instinctual.

Some historians say that climate matters, scientists say it doesn't. Broadly thinking, Africa compared to Europe.

I think the heat combined with the city has some detrimental effects.

<blockquote>10/14/13
You've become so lazy. Sit in air conditioner. The heat is destroying you. Take a lighter backpack.</blockquote>

I believe in this thought, I meant lazy in not doing work toward current direction, that the heat was driving me to do other things.

<blockquote>~7/12 sometime in India:
The effects of heat: stop from working, difficult breathing, loss of appetite.</blockquote>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[When I shifted from travel to house person, I found a problem with reading books. Many assumed one knew a bunch of ancient references or body of knowledge.

I simply could not relate to authors of books because they are insular. Too many references from media, usually from the Western Canon (I think I wrote this while reading Antifragile). To understand them is to Wikipedia several references which lead to common ideas. This is not the way to go about creating. One has to start with nothing, assume nothing, like a well designed game tutorial, or a book that starts with series of propositions, or any film.

There hasn’t been many generations that hasn't grown up without great books as a source of knowledge, but of these generation, nearly none of them read them, only know of them, through another media. Few have read Aristotle, but perhaps has a vague idea of his life and writings through references of other media. And that is okay.

I guess the problem I have is that lots of books assume so much, especially with regards to how society acts and knows, and in doing so, made them unreadable.

References to media should always be avoided. It is always better to reference personal experiences, because they are more relatable. And perhaps even more interesting, because it is personal and unique.

[TODO: can write more]

Update:
I later found writings that begin with a proposition and build from that i.e. Tractacus, The Prince, etc. a decent form.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It's natural for people to have an idea of the nature of the world, but I find it unnecessary for such lengthy proofs.

If one is presenting a new proposition, then it should be just that. No book required. The proposition will likely be invalidated soon.

Books should be formatted and ordered as such: proposition, a few of the best examples that cover nearly everything.

The books that brought this thought at the time were Antifragile, and Surfaces and Essences.

Only one of the charts was needed for Antifragile. Surface and Essences could have used some graphical representation of examples too.

Books that have several ideas, say The Death and Life of Great American Cities, should still follow another format: all propositions, then all propositions again with examples (cases).

Gladly, some fine people usually take care of the extraction and post it to Wikipedia.

God, books are such a lame way to transmit content.

At least when Wittgenstein wrote a book, he tried to explain the world. Every line was a proposition. And he did it in 75 pages. That should be regarded the standard of philosophy books.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[A thought:
<blockquote>After a brief Wikipedia browsing of ziprasodone, anti-psychotics, schizophrenia, pyschosis, and sensory deprivation, it seems science is slowly proving what a healthy life requires -- sensory stimuli, social interaction, happiness, a good life.</blockquote>

Medicine has passed the point where basic life actions such as social interaction, diet, and exercise, are being replaced by medicine. 

Surely there must be some kind of general rule that practitioners follow that states not to give medicine if natural lifestyle changes could solve the problem.

Unfortunately, I don't feel it exists.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In the end of a blog about information and mediums, I said: <blockquote>The more sensual the unknown product the more pleasurable it becomes and the faster data is transmitted.</blockquote>

With that known, and according to my history [todo: need to link blog], it is natural to choose the more pleasurable art objects or experience.

I naturally chose games, then films, then new media, then books, in that order. Of course I used Wikipedia to follow up, and dialog with friends. It's interesting to see that books came last in my education; It is my last choice in gaining information.

If one want to learn about ethics, watch a film rather than read a book. If ones wants to learn about strategy, play a strategy game rather than watch a film. If one wants to learn how to make something, make it rather than observing others make things.

If one of the goals of education is to make subjects interesting, then using newer art mediums is a natural method, especially for a self-education where experience is impossible (stuck in a house) or just really inconvenient.

A lot of my history was just random play (hedonism?) rather than a directed curriculum, but luckily, there's enough content in the world where one can learn and live via newer art objects and experience while living a surprisingly pleasurable life.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[A thought after coming to my parent's house:
<blockquote>
10/6
Within the past few days I had these thoughts:
If a person grows up in a city, and isn't completely isolated within a house, that person would have been exposed to more information, through all senses, than he would have in a controlled environment. In a controlled environment (house, class, suburbs) data is directed by educators and/or media. Growth depends entirely on the interaction of the person with other persons. And if there are no persons, then an interactive media, such as the internet.

No. There's a lot to learn in a house, there's just more in a city. Interactions of masses of people in the public cannot be entirely comprehended. If one has leisure time in a city, it's quite easy to max a brain out with the sensorial input of the artificial and people.

It's quite difficult to emulate the city experience at home, and even more difficult when one combines media and city life: simultaneously listening to headphones, talking to multiple friends on a smartphone, while on a subway. Human interaction cannot be emulated; It can only be observed. The closest practical solution to creating as much input is Veidt's: an array of televisions, and perhaps each with it's own audio output. And even then some of those televisions should have a person simply walking with a video camera, which no television program does.

When I arrived to my parent's house I experienced a huge step down in the feeling of experience, and I've never been able to get to a city level, and sure not an Asian city levels. It's too artificial, cold. In order for me to create I cannot be in a void, or perhaps only temporarily, like late nights at a library. But I still need a stimulus-filled normal life.</blockquote>

Life cannot be emulated.

The amount of sensorial information gained from a city cannot be surpassed by media unless the media is interactive, and even then, it's quite difficult.

If one grows up in the suburbs, or in a house far from having any sort of public life, it is natural for a person to try to consume as much media as one can to simulate the city. Technology now allows people to communicate, and even then, it's not quite the same as physically being in proximity.]]></content:encoded>

10/3
Should life be based on some kind of time? Why? Why not just live according to one's body time? Time depends on current interest. If one needs to talk to people, than one likely should wake up with those people. If one's friends wake up at the same time as you, then the time of others does not matter.</blockquote>

There are two factors in time. Personal interest and the sun.

If one has a social life, one will wake up on a similar time with them.

If one lives in a city, and enjoys being awake in accordance to others in the city, one wakes up with the city.

If one has neither, one has no reason to wake up on time. He will just follow his own body and interests.

If one sleeps outside, or in a place where sufficient sunlight exists, the heat may wake one up.

If one sleeps in a place where noise exists during a certain period of time, one may wake up during that time.

If one sleeps with people nearby, one may wake up with them.

But external stimuli does not defeat will.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[If you just walk around your city or town, you'll likely find something that just shouldn't exist. You wonder, why was this made?

Perhaps it existed since or before the Industrial Revolution. That's reasonable.

Yet, there are tons of places in the world that follow those ancient designs. In India, China, Korea, and Taiwan there are rows of giant apartment buildings being built close together in random areas with no commercial buildings in sight.

I usually just give them a bewildered look from a transportation vehicle: train in India, the Yunan airport entrance, a train in Taiwan, a bus in Korea, a bus in Japan. There's a scene in an Edward Yang film (Taipei Story?) where a guy looks out of an office window toward apartment buildings being built, also bewildered.

Why anyone would want to live there, I am unsure. Do humans need housing that badly? Is a tent not enough? Can't one just buy a plot of land and build a nice little one story in the middle of nowhere? Property and its relation to humans is really complex, even more so in cities where some people have a choice.

Science parks are similarly baffling and inhumane. Did the government team up with Rockefeller?

How the heck do these old ideologies still exist? Was it just the image of American modern buildings that other governments envied and revolted by building their own Petronas Towers, alongside slums?

The distance of modern architecture to romanticism is so far.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Cultural Values of Households in Asia</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[a part of a thought after going to an uncle's house, after coming back to my parent's house in Virginia:
<blockquote>
10/2/2014
...The rich value large houses in farms, isolated from the city, in India and when they immigrate...</blockquote>

Cultural values differ, and this is especially apparent and interesting in Asia.

In Korea, Japan, sometimes in India, and sometimes in America (especially of young professionals), and probably much of the world, people with choice seem to value living a high-ride modern building in a city. More points for being near a body of water or close to downtown. More amenities, more points. The same logic applies to hotels.

In India, people with choice value living in a large farmhouse with several servants.

In Taiwan, a small house with a garden in a nice neighborhood is best. Not a bad ideal! The high-rises in 信義區 are a new phenomenon, perhaps influenced by the West.

In America, some dream of living in a large house in the South where the land is cheap, not too different from the hippie's dream.

From this, it seems people with choice have a tendency to isolate themselves from the city. Are the people on the street that hideous?

What's really frightening is when those people with certain values of households immigrate to America. Indians who lived in farmhouses move to gated communities.

Surprisingly, Chinese people do extremely well in creating their own towns on the outskirts of Western cities. No high rises. Some of the best street life that exists in America exist in Chinatowns. Well, I guess if these Chinese immigrants had money in their own country, they wouldn't have moved here. I've always lived near a Chinatown, and it may be because I value these people the most.

I hope to move back to one those smaller apartments in the intellectual center of Taipei.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>
10/2
People from the suburbs, like farms of any developed country, create knowledge from what's around. Even with the development of the internet, people still lack much knowledge.
</blockquote>

An interesting phenomenon.

Even in the Information Age, the suburbs are still far from a progressive lifestyle. It is surprising how little has changed before and after the internet.

Is it because the people have become accustomed to the society and lack action to change from it? What goes on in the mind of a person who lives in an older society when they experience media from a more modern one? What does America mean to an Indonesian? What does the city mean to a suburbanite? Just some distant society which has no affect on one's own?

The most interesting observation is that people prioritize reality over media. Few people get ideas from media or other societies. Instead, it's what they experience in the reality of daily life form which they derive most of their knowledge.

Is it prioritization of reality over media or a lack of will to take action toward a different society?

For the most of the world, sadly, I imagine is the lack of free time to even think about it. In the suburbs of America, this is not the case.

The suburbs are always a perplexing society.

<blockquote>~2/14/13 to 8/6/13 in San Francisco the second time:
People in the suburbs worry about silly things.</blockquote>

The suburbs are conducive to laziness. The free-time is ill-used.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[A thought sometime in Japan:
<blockquote>In the past, whenever I watched a great film, I worked harder, my ambitions grew, it cleared my head of all of the silly small things, like a good scooter ride. It kept me in direction, and that direction is creating great films. But isn't that because I'm consuming it? Copying. Creating what I'm consuming. That's wrong, isn't it? Is it right to copy something you love?</blockquote>

Also going over thoughts in San Francisco and New York, it seems I consumed a lot of games, and used them as a basis for creativity. The results were not so good.

This is a common thought of any artist, and I will answer that it is wrong. One can learn the aesthetic idea of other arts, but the <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/a-design-strategy-for-data">creation of it should be based on sensual input</a> from life, aka nature.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[a thought soon after moving from Japan to Taiwan:
<blockquote>Consume more locally. You were into games in New York because that is what you consumed. In Taiwan, there are no games. Consume Taiwan -- life, travel, people. Do something with that.</blockquote>

When one lives in the city, especially in hostels, where one interacts with the people one lives with, institutions of the city, and the general public, social determinism is likely more influential than media determinism[?].

When I was in college, I thought it would have been great to make films or games, because I loved watching films and playing games. When I was in San Francisco, I was unable to build much interest because I was working most of the time. When I was in New York, I thought it was great to make games, though games played from the suburbs did influence, moreso, there was a scene if independent game developers in New York.

When I began traveling, I kept these influences with me, for a very long period of time. When I travelled through Thailand, I wanted to document the gritty parts of Bangkok. When I was motorcycling slowly through northwest Thailand, I was thinking of game ideas and making small prototypes. When I travelled through Laos, I wanted to document tribal people's a la Vincent Moon, or just make films with them somehow. When I was in Vadodara, India, I had a friend come, and we were supposed to make a game, but we didn't. And at that time, I really felt no need to make games.

In India, there was but only a small audience that could afford the leisure or device (iPhone, iPad) to play games, and an even smaller audience that would want to; There was more to life, it seemed. India was no place for the development for video games. Games sure, but not ones associated to expensive devices. How could I make something that a large portion of the world, one I was visibly surrounded by?

Games had loss a bit of interest to me because of this, and I still haven't quite been able to recover interest to it. The ideal thought nagged: why would I bother making things that only a narrow audience could appreciate? (At the time I was more into pushing aesthetics of games, experimenting with mechanics.) Films made much more sense. Indians love Bollywood.

My question, similar to Kevin Kelly's, What Does Technology Want, resulted in <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/information-media-and-education">this conclusion</a>.

At a later point, I arrived to Taiwan. I had already been nearly a year before. At that time I had 9 days to explore Taipei. As I did in previous cities in East Asia, I searched out all forms of contemporary art. I found that the art institutions of Taipei were quite a bit behind Tokyo, and far behind New York, in aesthetics. The Digital Art Center just had a room full of videos playing. The Museum of Contemporary Arts had a mix of traditional medias. After quite an amazing exhibition at Tokyo's NTT ICC, Taipei disappointed, though I loved Taipei for a billion other reasons, and though far behind in the arts, I still would choose that country over New York as my ideal place to live.

But finding people of similar interests proved difficult. If there aren't people who experienced new media, how could I pursue it? Should it be pursued?

If it doesn't exist in the city, how can people experience it? I guess through the internet. But the country is a bit insular, in that people normally use Google in Chinese and likely look at arts in Beijing, which probably isn't bad.

I believe my greatest failure in continuing the pursuit of arts was this: that I failed to educate others of the ideas that I experienced in New York to the people of Taipei. I didn't quite realize this at the time; I just didn't understand why no one else knew about those aesthetics, and my misunderstanding lead me to do other things.

I found interest in Chinese, of course, because I wanted to talk to the people around me. That's the best example of social determinism one can have.

So, instead of pursuing games and new media, I took Chinese classes and began Humans of Taiwan (a mix of wanting to talk to people and my fascination of the public), and continued with life.

Though the internet exists, there are differences in knowledge of aesthetics. Taiwanese people have a rather high proficiency of English too, but they use their own Google and media world. Perhaps Ai Wei Wei leads them to more modern ideas. As aesthetics get closer to experience, one can't even experience certain aesthetics without living in proximity to a city of current art. <strong>Aesthetics is almost tied to location by social determination</strong>, and I frustrated myself in searching for people with similar knowledge and interests of aesthetics without knowing why.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[A thought soon after moving to Taiwan:
<blockquote>Live in traditional area, work in city, as I did in San Francisco and New York.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Everything can be done locally. The neighborhood is very important. The more traditional, the better. No commute. Just walk outside. It's beautiful.</blockquote>

<blockquote>between 9/28/13 and 10/7/13:
Live far from the city. In a residential, quiet area. Somewhere where it feels like Taiwan. Not a city.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>10/9/13
Stick to high art and professional work, yet live locally, for inspiration.</blockquote>

Households, especially in cities, depend on the area (unless one is really rich and not interested in people). If it didn't, everyone would live in rural areas in giant houses for a low amount.

In my past, it seems I strived to live in a traditional area, yet have easy access to the city. Whatever their tradition is. This meant living in Chinatowns in San Francisco. I would have done the same for New York, but time was running. Chinatowns offered me cheap property, cheap groceries, cheap eats, a nearby park, and friendly people. In Taiwan, I lived next to a day / night market in the heart of the city. That's my ideal area, the simple pleasures in life: nature and cheap food.

Even better, would be to have some kind of novelty. It being foreign. Something to draw inspiration from on a daily basis.

That is, at least my first place of dwelling. After that I make friends. Soon, I find myself moving in with them. Then I make more friends, and soon, I find myself living closer to my closest friends.

That leads to another ideal: to work with friends.

<blockquote>10/10/13
I'm quite scared of working. I think I just need friends to work with. That's all. I'm thinking too negative right now.</blockquote>

Once one has achieved in living with with friends, then working with friends, then hopefully, they can all move together in the area of their choice. That is the order.

It is a common false belief that one should live near their job. One's job shouldn't exist in an undesirable location. The choice in location reflects the choice of the company.

<blockquote>>9/3/13
I barely walk for an hour and I see no reason to go further. There is no goal. Nothing to see. No people to meet. I'd rather talk to the people at the fishing area, or just hang out within their proximity.</blockquote>

An hour's walk is the max one goes to take a break, at least, in a city. So, it is important for the vicinity to have shared values. Only a strong interest (likely social) will pull a person further than one hour.

<blockquote>9/16/13 in Osaka
What place is best to live? In places where struggle exist I feel extremely creative. In places where there is no struggle, I can work for long hours, not thinking about the time that passes. Neither is good. I need to combine work and life, as I did in Seoul.</blockquote>

<blockquote>We only think when confronted with a problem.
  - John Dewey</blockquote>

The places on dwells directly affects the way one lives, and works (if one believes in social determinism, or wants to be part of society). Choosing a place to dwell should be based on what one wants to do. Cities provide communities, venues, school lectures, and more for artists. Developing countries with problems may sway one toward human rights and politics. Living in two contrasting societies can make one feel that the other is absurd.

Creativity in cities can lead to furthering of aesthetics. My history clearly shows that I think of aesthetic ideas while living in a city where I consume contemporary art. Though, that may be from reacting to it. I do often think about high art in less developed places too, but it's greatly affected by the locality, perhaps using less technology and more local materials: local craftsmen, bamboo, food carts, natural landscapes.

Creativity in developing countries, or any society other than one's own, also provides another perspective, <strong>which will shape what one creates</strong>. It forces the creator to be more mindful of the audience, resulting in a more universally appreciated art, one that works in their past society and current society, fitting for structuralism. It could have elements of traditional cultures, different political systems, different amounts of wealth. I feel Ai Wei Wei exceeds because of this. He can use craftsmen in China to create a massive piece, understanding their place on a human and political scale.

Creativity in developing countries can also lead to practical applications, useful technology. In a developed country, technology seems to have passed the needs of humans. Each individual could live with 50 things or less. Living with less would increase the chance of creating something useful. If it is useful to someone with less, it is likely be useful to the rest.

Therefore, I believe creating in a developing country may be better for artists, humanists, innovators, hippies, and, perhaps, anyone of age. With the internet, it is easy to catch up current sciences and aesthetics. Being a part of a human rights community would surely lead to more practical technology. If one has time, one can continue creating high aesthetic art with a unique perspective, likely more political. Though, it may be difficult without a community, such as those that exist in cities.

<blockquote>>6/28/13 in Hong Kong:
I'd rather live in a random town and work there. Build a community. Make personal art. Somewhere in east Asia, where the people are nice.</blockquote>

The people have to be nice though, resulting in a more social, lively life, in which I am less likely to consume media.

<blockquote><8/6/13 in New York
Putting myself in an uncomfortable position makes me more productive.</blockquote>

<blockquote>~2/14/13 to 8/6/13 in New York:
At this point, my excitement for the city is over. I have to take large outdoor trips or travel to Hawaii or Japan. Somewhere completely different.</blockquote>

Need access to nature. Though, Jon said he camped only an hour away.

<blockquote>~2/14/13 to 8/6/13 in San Francisco the second time:
Become a general designer. Go to different countries, villages. Figure out their largest problem. Create a solution.

It would be cool to travel, stumble upon a village with a problem, design a solution that is effective and elegant, and hope it inspires the village and whoever that passes by.</blockquote>

<blockquote>~7/12 in India:
Placement is important. Place oneself around smart futurists, yet also place oneself around people of need. Leverage technology to help people. Innovate here. Mobile applications for health, society, education; Rehabilitation and recovery games.

One should be useful to the place one lives in.</blockquote>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[A thought sometime soon after moving to Taiwan:
<blockquote>I need to maintain one of he following to stay active: social life and excitement, caffeine, or exercise.</blockquote>

Of the primitive pleasures, there are: talking, exercise, food, and caffeine.

Starve one from these, and the person may do weird things.



<blockquote>There was so much time in a day. What the fuck happened to it today? I need to consume more of the world around me. I was ignoring too much. If I ignore the world, I can always watch a film, but I failed to do that. I just went through the day, meaningless.

Difficult to live and create simultaneously.

I'm waking up without reason, creativity. I really miss that. I'm unable to balance life and work. It distracts me from my personal direction. My motivation.</blockquote>

Of the advanced pleasures, there is creativity.


<blockquote>10/9/13
I question the study of a language. I am not a social person. I often see time of being social as a waste. It's life, it's fun, I remember it, but my brain is off. I'd rather be social with people I share work with.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The younger crowd in my class consume pop media, work at cafes and bars. I don't want to be a part of that. I needed some social time because I've been traveling so much, but they don't have to be long term friends. I need to create my own close friends. People with taste, intelligence, ambition. Life is great, but it's not enough for me.</blockquote>


<blockquote>10/15/13
Class is not as motivating as art or work or life!</blockquote>

It seems a hierarchy exists. Creativity is more pleasurable than simply social activity. This harks the old thought of choosing New York for creativity or Taipei for simple pleasures.]]></content:encoded>

Prioritize time! Do as much as you can in one day, simultaneously thinking about art, life, and people. Live by the hour.</blockquote>

It's nice to think all of the time. But I think it's nice to at least think about what you are doing and it's result every hour.

This is really great for a liberal education where several disciplines are wanted, as it provides a gestalts. Life, film, non-fiction all come together. Knowledge is confirmed in several forms.

One is also simply less likely to fall into routine slave-like work.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>10/10/13
I failed to talk to people for the purpose of humans. It was a waste of time. Wanderlust in the city. No social time. No work. No learning. Like the weekends in San Francisco. I need routine. A moment of a schizoid. This only happens when I am alone, otherwise I'm quick, watching time. In that moment in Wenhua, I was stuck. An extreme care for bums and lower class people. Hesitant of communicating with them. The humans project is a psychological battle.</blockquote>

This was indeed a strange moment.

I was in 萬華區 taking photos for Humans of Taiwan. It's the grittiest part of Taiwan. The metro exits into a park full of people. Many not even Taiwanese. It's visibly poorer, filthier, with an extremely high density of people.

The past few days I did well in talking to people and taking pictures. This moment changed that. After talking to a few people and taking a picture, at some point I was unable to continue. I couldn't talk to some, or anyone anymore. My mind stopped forming Chinese sentences. Perhaps facing the poor caught up to me emotionally, and my care for them stopped me, from doing anything.

I mean, what was I doing anyway? To them I am perceived as a tourist taking a photo with them, or a language student, taking a photo of them. Taiwanese people know how Taiwanese people are. Was I really gaining any unique insight into human nature?

<blockquote>My bane: Unable to make meaningful social interactions with lower class people while living a higher class one. Extreme care? So powerful that it stops me for hours.</blockquote>]]></content:encoded>

I hate doing anything alone.
...
I think with a cafe job I would be more calm, happy. Live more, worry less.

I don't want to be alone again. Keep talking to people!

Still haven't learned how to live and work simultaneously.</blockquote>





<blockquote>10/12
A hostel or NGO would be fun. It's closer to life than new media, and involves interaction with people.</blockquote>





<blockquote>10/15
Keep meeting people. Keep talking. Keep staying in social spaces, or outside.

I can't stand being inside a room anymore. I must stay outside, day and night. Sleep outside, somewhere, in the public, with people.

I can't spend time alone. At least, not on a computer, or not after a long day of living.

You must stay social. Otherwise the day is wasted. Keep talking to people.

I must find a way to keep life exciting!

I've lost interest in the world. I don't want to even get out of bed. I need to be more social. I need more work. I need to keep doing things.

Another day wasted. Failed to be social. Failed to be excited about traveling. Poop.</blockquote>





In Taiwan, I came to a point where I didn't want to do anything alone. Social determinism at max effect?

Sure, I had choice of the people, what to talk about, and what to do, but that made everything limited to mutual interests.

I was happy as long as I was social. It was as simple as that.]]></content:encoded>

Along with indecisiveness is the search for the ideal. Always looking for something better, as opposed to making with what one is given.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Hippie Ethics</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[a thought soon after Taiwan:
<blockquote>I have no idea of what life is. Should I care for the less fortunate? Innovate? Live happily in a third world country? It seems all I can do is live. Spend less time in indecision and do as much as I can, while still taking the time to create.</blockquote>

The ethics of a hippie is to create or be part of a good community who's values the hippie aligns with. This often comes in the form of a public space: an NGO, a progressive school, a hostel, a new school, a community center; It could also be in the form of a online organization. Values may include: advocation of human rights and equal rights and peace, minimal materials, time for creativity, diversity, be charitable, etc.

The stereotyped ethics of a hippie, an artist, and intellectual are the same, just different in emphasis.

Independent organizations whom have these values have risen thanks to the information age. DIY spaces, event spaces, workshops and lecture series, NGOs, are all at the edge of technology and modern values. Large institutions can't keep up.

To me, it seems a good way to live is to live within one of these institutions, at the edge of technology and modern values. Spend time contributing to the community. And since I suffer from passions, to spend some time creating.

These kinds of communities exist everywhere; Does it matter which one joins? Should it be one of the highest academia, in technology, art, values, and methods? What is the difference between an organization in New York and one in Nicaragua? In the information age, does it matter?

New York is indeed at the forefront of intelligence, innovation, technology, aesthetic, and so on. It has several well-developed communities that cooperate to create powerful animals, which themselves cooperate to create more powerful animals, which eventually turn into a big apple.

Nicaragua does not. One would have to rely on the internet and friends abroad to gain information. One would have to educate these ideas to the local. Modern art will not be appreciated by anyone. But to me, there are some really gripping pros: <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/imitate-nature-or-art" title="Imitate Nature or Art">the proximity of nature</a>, a new culture (which could prevent art from <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/universalism-in-art" title="Universalism in Art">becoming narrow</a>, or encapsulate the cultural characteristics), and <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/minimalism-ethics" title="Minimalism Ethics">minimalism</a>.

Minimalism, I feel, is the greatest factor. Though it's very possible to live in New York with hippie ethics, it's easier to become distracted, disgusted, without creating a tiny space where one's mind can keep a more right social construct of the world. In Nicaragua, nature offers space which gives a feeling of freedom. To live in New York one needs strong will. To live in Nicaragua, it's less needed. This affects one's daily life, in the work one does and the things one creates.

In creativity, I see two values. The first is to create for functionality from a minimalistic perspective. One is less likely to create something wasteful, and conversely, more useful to the people around, who may have a low human development, which has a higher chance of being useful to the rest of the world too (though they may have a more expensive technology that does the same). The second is to create for aesthetics from a minimalistic perspective. Again, One is less likely to waste money into the art object (this works well because there is no correlation between aesthetic and wealth), and conversely, more likely to use the materials around, which may lead to more creative products.

[TODO: can argue more]

I said Nicaragua, but personally, my dilemma was between New York and Taiwan. I love both, one The City the other the romantic ideal. Perhaps this was an attempt to rationalize my reasons to desire to live in both.

Ways to do good in the modern world:
diversify media
diversify the ways people get media
reverse propaganda / doctrine
help individuals (human needs)
create new / progressive schools
- create new curriculums for them
distribute wealth
distribute labor
work and or participate in a good community
innovate for good* (functionally with new media, also satisfies creativity passion!)
advocate good ideas (human rights, environmental, equality, etc.)
create media art with good content
create public art with good content
utilitarian ethics
educate
document?
and as always, help everyone around (family, friends, neighbors, local community, city communities)

All of these things are worth doing, but even more, what has the greatest, lasting, effect on humans?

Order of good deeds:
politics
academics and media
academic and political relationships
local relationships

I live a life so far from local life. It's terrible.</blockquote>

<blockquote>9/24/13
I'm a hypocrite. I love new technology yet I love being with all classes of society. In less developed countries it did not make sense to make iPad games as people around me couldn't afford it. My interests change as the place and people around me change. My artistic medium changes too. Film makes more sense in less developed areas as there is a lot of human struggle visible. New media and games make sense in large cities as one is competing to create something innovative, grand.</blockquote>



<blockquote>10/12/13
Interaction is what keeps you going through the day, consuming more.</blockquote>

<blockquote>10/10/13
I'm not consuming fast enough when I am alone. I need to surround myself with working people, or else I'll get lazy. I need to be in a crazy part of a city, to keep me thinking, or else I'll dwell on unnecessary things. / I need to constantly surround myself with people or else I become lazy.</blockquote>



<blockquote>before 9/3/13
Effects of environment. How making games make no sense in India. How being around slums in Kathmandu made me want to do more social work. How being around people in India made me want to just be around them. How being in New York made me competitive. Why am I so affected by environment? Or is it all temporary? At the end, I left these places when I became comfortable, moving on to consume more.</blockquote>




<blockquote>9/19/13 in Tokyo, Japan
Seoul was great too, being extremely social. Not even moving without social interaction. I lived by the hour, constantly surrounded by people.</blockquote>

<blockquote>>9/3/13
When I'm with people I want to have fun. When in alone I desire struggle. I seek how I feel at the moment.</blockquote>



<blockquote>9/24/13
A fascination for human struggle. The human condition. I live and work harder for it. I feed on it through films that depict struggle, or meeting people during my travels, living with the lower class, talking to other travelers, office workers, people on the street, to the point of despising anyone wealthier. The suburbs show no visible struggle, so I perform poorly as a result. Cities and less developed countries have struggle. Will I be productive in a more happy country such as Taiwan? Or will the safety of it bore me as suburbs do. I thought the freedom of Taiwan would be advantageous. Perhaps if I keep many social contact I will fight for time with people. Still, I think I need to live outside, on the street.</blockquote>

<blockquote>10/20/13
I can't concentrate anymore. I'm not fighting for life anymore. Taiwan is making me lazy. I need to stick to myself, my New York ambitious self.

I've lived such a good life in Taiwan I forgot what struggle is. The people who struggle.

Perhaps I need to struggle to create something grand again.</blockquote>

Constant struggle is key for artists, isn't it?

<blockquote>
10/21/13
Taipei is a happy place to be, but it makes it uninteresting.

Do not conform. Stay an outsider. Criticize society.</blockquote>

When society has a high average visible happiness, does that correlate to a low average amount of artists?]]></content:encoded>

<blockquote>>9/3/13 in Seoul
Time flies without motivation.
...
Art drives me when I am alone. My art has to be social, to keep track of time.
...
As I sit alone at the train station, the faces of people appear again. Care for others arise, along with criticism. I begin to watch time.</blockquote>

<blockquote>9/18/13 in Osaka, Japan
I left the hostel without direction because I hate being indoors. It feels as if the world moved without me. I need to be with people all of the time, yet I need to maintain my high level of thinking.</blockquote>



<blockquote>9/22/13 in Tokyo, Japan
New experiences make time pass slow. While traveling I'm always experiencing something new. Meeting new people, seeing new things, taking a new path, eating something new, thinking about these new things. There is no routine in traveling. I wonder, will I be able to translate this to work? Most work requires routine. Only the design stage is new. How will I be able to satisfy my hunger for the new while working?</blockquote>







<blockquote>9/24/13
One moment I'm fighting for every minute to create a new experience. Another moment time passes freely, without motive.
...
The long commutes on subways are damaging. Time flies.

Monotonous commutes are indeed dangerous.</blockquote>

<blockquote>10/22/13
Need to give self deadlines. Without it I just live, without work and life. Deadlines should exist for both. Need to travel and be social to understand length of time.</blockquote>



<blockquote>>9/3/13 in Busan
Mandy said "You feel it was long because you experienced so much". It's true. You have to constantly create new experiences.</blockquote>







Time seems to be linked to social time, work, and more.

Time is maximized during new experiences, hence people often feel traveling feels much longer than it is.

Therefore, <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/maximum-time-ethics">is life maximized by maximizing time?</a>



<blockquote>In India:
6/27 and 6/28 were wasted days. I'm thinking about what to do rather than doing it. It's good to think all of the time, but one also had to be doing. I shouldn't be planning full-time. I could be making games! Helping people! Allocate time to planning, don't let it hinder your work. Balance time. Wander. Don't be do inclusive.</blockquote>

If I spend time not being social, then I consider it a waste of time.]]></content:encoded>

Talking is creative. It's easy to forget, but once one is learning a language, it's easier to feel the brain work to put together grammar and memorize words.

It's the inscription onto mediums that are painful, because they are not social, and therefore offer little pleasure while in the crafting phase.]]></content:encoded>

10/11/13
It is good to have priorities of social things, like learning language, Humans, and Vincent Moon. I feel it provides a more relaxed, yet productive lifestyle. I overwork myself.</blockquote>

<blockquote>You have to enjoy life at every moment. Don't worry so much. Keep living. I can feel the worry of money seeping in</blockquote>

<blockquote>>6/28/13
The trick to traveling is to keep moving. Don't choose or research, just go. The trick to living is to travel everyday for a short period of time. No, travel all the time. Everyday is an adventurer.</blockquote>

<blockquote>>9/3/13You have to stay outside. Never inside. Keep wandering. Keep talking to people. Keep working outside. There's nothing inside a building.</blockquote>


<blockquote>thoughts from Japan before 9/24/13:
There's no end to life. No settling. An infinite roller coaster.</blockquote>



<blockquote>
10/25/13
I'd rather live a life of adventure rather than planning.</blockquote>



<blockquote>10/26/13
After a night out with that girl I met at the concert:
...
She did have one point: I don't know how to relax, which is something Kate said.

...

The morning sets the pace. That initial push to go out, and stay out, exploring, socializing. It's the houses and libraries that make me complacent and unsocial. You have to keep moving and talking. Don't stop. Only study during breaks in life.</blockquote>

<blockquote>~2/14/13 to 8/6/13 in New York
I need to constantly explore. Physically and mentally.
...
Don't think far in the future. Just think what to do now, and do that, then there will be a less chance of work going to waste.
...
Just do it. Make shit all day non stop.
</blockquote>

They may seem to be an irrational ethic, but the body's action doesn't really matter, it is separate from the mind. The change in external stimuli seem to be key.]]></content:encoded>

The idea of going home and being at home results in less action, and more likely to passively consume. This is because only one's housemates exist in the house, and media. Only if one lived with housemates whom one wants to take action with would going home lead to more action. <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/experience-and-action">Though with technology one can talk which may result in fruitful actions, it is less likely than physically being together</a>.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[My feeling of weirdness of static places to work (office work, looking at laptop, reading a book) may come from the the fact that most media is written, or to generalize, visual. Audio seems to be quite undervalued, and often replaced by music. Though music is great, just think of how many audiobooks one could have listened to instead of music.

A good example of the weirdness is in the film Of Gods and Men. Watching those monks sit and read all day is otherworldly. They abstain from the pleasure of talking! Compare that to a street in an Asian city.

When living a less sedentary lifestyle, one gets into a habit of using more audio sources (audiobooks, lectures, radio, language courses) and using voice message apps (LINE? Perhaps all of the Asian communication apps) for communication. All of this, of course, simultaneously while doing something else with ones eyes and body.

It feels as if the world was constructed around books, and now with technology, feels rather ancient.

Perhaps in a future, instead of office buildings, people would just gather in public areas and do their work while walking around and talking; If it's cold, there could be a fireplace.

<blockquote>Though with technology one can talk which may result in fruitful actions, it is less likely than physically being together.</blockquote>

Why is the physical presence of people a stronger incentive to action than media?

This thought comes close to thoughts about public spaces and DIY spaces.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Though this doesn't seem to be the trend in America, I felt it was in Taiwan and Japan.

Perhaps backpackers achieve getting closest to this. There are many who keep a list of items they have with totals often less than 50. (<a href="http://carrotquinn.com/2014/03/26/pct-2014-gear-list/">example</a>)

After backpacking Asia for a long time, Kevin Kelly also tried to stick to these ethics. He went further. Trying to list what technologies were actually useful. As time goes, more products become obsolete, products become smaller, life is more convenient. The iPhone is a billion tools in one.
--

To live a fully developed life, all one really needs is water, food, dwelling to protect from weather, a personal computer, an educated person to learn from, especially for younger years, a person educated in medicine with equipment.

Therefore all the material items one needs are: a water filter, food (if grain is rice, then a pot and fire, or, a rice cooker), a personal computer, a tutor or parental figure (if young), and healthcare.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I feel I have a rather unique characteristic that has greatly influenced my life: I only talk to people in proximity.

The norm is is to keep relationships healthy via communication over the telephone, e-mail, and video-chat. I only talk communicate to people if they are physically near.

If I live in a house in a suburb, then I am alone.

If I live in a city, I have the people in the city.

If I live in a house with several roommates, I will talk to those people more than more-valued relationships.

If I live in another country, then I do not talk to the people in the last country.

I believe I do this because I have no control of my social impulses. If someone is nearby, I talk. If there is a delicious piece of foodstuffs nearby, I eat it. It's not much different. It's a pleasure to talk, as it is to eat. The proximity of pleasures result in action. Perhaps that makes me <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/hedonism" title="Hedonism">hedonistic</a>.

This trait alone causes destruction of relationships, makes me prone to <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/social-determinism" title="Social Determinism">social determinism</a>, and eventually leads to severe <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/adaptation" title="Adaptation">adaptation</a> to different societies.

The only way to make me work is to put me in a work place. The only way to make me talk is to place me in a place filled with people. The only way for me to make art is to place me in a place where many people make art. The only way for me to work for charity is to place me in a place that requires charity.

Sure, I make decisions, sometimes getting out of society and therefore escaping social determinism, but, for the most part, it seems my life has almost entirely depended on where I place myself. Therefore, <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/the-ideal-neighborhood" title="The Ideal Neighborhood">the placement</a> of myself is of utmost importance.]]></content:encoded>

perhaps I need to live like a poor person. Perhaps I need to stop pushing people away. But I have to keep exploring in my own way.

<blockquote>2/8/14
Is there a way to experience life while creating?</blockquote>

Often, when I say action in my thoughts, I mean, a thought that leads to me taking an action via my will in a way I feel that is progressive. Progress can be anything from finding something delicious to eat to helping a friend.

The goal of this ethics is to <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/artist-productivity-ethics" title="Artist Productivity Ethics">constantly be doing something </a>"progressive", which makes me happy, and in some kind of direction I want.



<blockquote>>9/12/13 in Busan
Living and working, simultaneously, is something I feel I've been striving for my entire life.

I feel that work life balance is different. It suggests that they are separate entities. I never feel that way.

Some people can go to an office work, come out, then enjoy life with their family and friends. The work hard play hard lifestyle. I'm constantly trying to fit work in life. I have no hours. I just live.

This is when I felt that computer programming is devoid of life. I spent most of the time in public places: outside, in a cafe, with friends, still it wasn't enough. I wasn't experiencing enough life. I filled the void with films. The only way to do a computer programming job is by having a steady workplace, at home with a family, or in place with friends.</blockquote>



<blockquote>Start shit all of the time. Run around. Events. Work. Doodle Tangle. Public Art. All that shit all of the time.</blockquote>

<blockquote>9/22/13 in Tokyo, Japan
New experiences make time pass slow. While traveling I'm always experiencing something new. Meeting new people, seeing new things, taking a new path, eating something new, thinking about these new things. There is no routine in traveling. I wonder, will I be able to translate this to work? Most work requires routine. Only the design stage is new. How will I be able to satisfy my hunger for the new while working?

I think I did well working a few hours at night at hostels, but what about the day time when my brain was dead. Should I learn to do nothing, consume nothing? Is this okay?

I need to live during my night hours. Stay outside, in a park, in a hostel. Keep living and working, even during off hours.</blockquote>

Living and working is another way to word this ethics. To maximize life, strive toward goals, yet survive.

Now, I think my conception of <em>work</em> for a long time was the office kind, sitting in front of a computer and doing work. That is what society conditioned me to think work is. That or my programming degree, I don't know. So I only felt I was doing work when I was working for a job or making a game. Did I not view everyone else's jobs as work? The service industry? I don't know. I'm just glad my conception of work has changed since then.

<blockquote>9/12/13 in Busan
Talking to the French guy was relaxing. He worked in Australia at Dominos as a pizza deliverer. He loved it. There was no worries. He and his co-workers would find ways to scam Dominos for money -- discount codes, petrol in a can, pizza status codes. He had fun. He had a new experience. That's all that matters, isn't it?</blockquote>

Almost hippie ethics.]]></content:encoded>

Travel to a random place everyday.

The change in audio and visual is what I need.</blockquote>

I had trouble choosing the middle word of the topic. Experience, stimuli, or external stimuli. I am not sure.

There's an interview of Chomsky on the 21st century where he mentioned the effects of modern technology can lead to stimulus addiction (? may not be accurate term).

Stimulus addiction leads to irrational behavior, sure, but <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/creativity-external-stimuli-cities-and-suburbs" title="Creativity, External Stimuli, Cities, and Suburbs">external stimulus invokes creativity</a>, which seems to be lacking from rational intellectuals.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I had a thought about making films about games.

The first short film had the theme that games leads to actions more so than books. It had two classmates from New York, one Chinese, one Hispanic. The Chinese one more book'ish, the Hispanic less. It shows the life of each. Then, there is an incedent they both pass individually. The Hispanic kid acts upon it quite intelligently, using the nearby city to his advantage. The Chinese ignores it.

I presented it to a local New York venue. I told them that perhaps I created them, and not games, because I grew up in the suburbs on film. That was my primary education. And somehow, I was stuck in the past.

I showed them another film, the draft of one, to test. The film was about also about games. It showed how ideas were transmitted through experience of playing games. In the end of the film, the film reached the limits of it's medium in transmitting ideas. The end had a frame that displayed press start to continue playing.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[the height of travel
  - an abstract world
  - life made no sense
  - why speak a certain language?
  - why do certain work?

When I flew from India to Hong Kong, I felt that I was on top of the world.

I saw through Hong Kong. I explored it within a week. I found the most valuable artists there. I had little to no interest to it's culture. I was done with it.

When I arrived in my high class hostel in Seoul, I felt the apex of Schizoid Personality Disorder (SPD).

I could barely go to the bathroom without thinking about how much money was being wasted at the hostel. After being in India and Nepal for 3 months, then going to Hong Kong for a week, the amount of goods in Seoul felt ridiculous: spacious rooms, clean, free water, six lane roads, cars, tons of space, cafes, endless comfort.
--

It was probably the deepest feeling I had during all of my travels. I would be talking to myself at really high speeds. Questioning everything, material and human. It was as if I was re-constructing what society is in my head.

I questioned why anyone could create anything. Life was far beyond a means a living, yet people moved to take action, perhaps toward some work, which I didn't understand.

I think it's because Seoul feels like a sprawling suburb, and suburbs are still non-sensical to me. My mind couldn't figure out why anyone who act in such ways.

[TODO: definitely worth thinking about why it had such a great effect]

<blockquote>>9/3/13
I adapt to the hostel in Seoul. I become accustomed to technology and money. I forget about others. I become less creative. I think less. And I hate myself for it all. I don't ever want to be lazy again.</blockquote>

Adapting to the developed world means becoming an automaton?]]></content:encoded>

Seems to occur after experiencing life (whether real or media) and then placing oneself in a lifeless area. As if there is no outlet for creativity (dialog, sense-data), so it comes out as a dream.

Sensory deprivation experiments agree.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>Reading is also awfully inefficient...especially when compared to listening and thinking. Listening is key. Need to turn books to audiobooks or films, or just create ways to learn the things I want to learn, without media.</blockquote>

There's no point of even reading, audiobooks replace it, and further, audiobooks is able to give a gestalts, because one is simultaneously taking other sensorial input. A book in a comfortable place: home or at a cafe, provokes less thought with surroundings than say, listening to an audiobook while in a subway, walking, or at a party. Time is lost, and more importantly, social life time is lost.

Update: After reading a bunch of books, there is a problem with audiobooks. It's a bit more difficult to read the table of contents and skim the contents of a book. Sliding through time is random. One can't simply skim to the first paragraph, or the first line of the next few paragraphs. Audiobooks need to be organized to have markers in time for chapters, and even mini-chapters.

What I had written this post, I wasn't listening to audiobooks, I was listening to lecture series. Lectures are superior in audio form. It's less likely one will have to skim a lecture. I took notes on my phone via a text editor application through dropbox text files. These notes were the equivalent of underlining. Perhaps even better than writing on the sides of a book, because what I write creates a summary of each lecture. It also provided me a time to think and write in a different language. It feels closer to dialog.]]></content:encoded>

Banksy’s role is to make people aware of what’s hidden in daily modern life, as with many other artists. A good example: the truck with stuffed animals, driving through Hell’s kitchen.</blockquote>

A list:
To further art aesthetics
To add something beautiful in the world
To add something empirically educational
To add something educational for humanities. If one believes in absolute truths, this is okay. Narrative (film, books) can be destructive a la propaganda.
To make people aware of the bad things in society. Sounds like the reverse of the above.
Because one has leisure time, and one is passionate
To express a thought in a form that a mass amount of people can consume it at any time

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>
9/16
Choosing actions based on the gathering of knowledge.
...
A constant progressive education.
...
Leading to DIY spaces in cities, independent schools in less developed areas, hostels, public venues, open mics, hip cafes, central parks.

These are spaces where diverse peoples converge, interact, share skills, experience together, share ideas.

There is a distinction between public spaces with events with an underlying business purpose and those without

What would the ideal space be?:

Something between a progressive school and a DIY space? One where people can be themselves yet participate in classes.

Mention modern schools in New York, The New School, and DIY spaces.
</blockquote>

It is indeed nice to see New York have many forms of public spaces: <a href="http://www.newschool.edu/">progressive schools</a>, <a href="http://babycastles.com/">DIY spaces</a>, public venues, <a href="http://flatironschool.com/">vocational schools</a>, and <a href="http://sfpc.io/">art schools not affected by wealth</a>.

Why did the resurgence of vocational schools take so long? No one should spend four years to learn how to make a website. A single workshop could do that. And nearly every university fails to offer a good liberal education.

That's what exists. Let's go back to nothing. What is the ideal public space?

It would have the obvious characteristics:
Everyone is welcome.
Physically open most of the time
Anyone can propose something.
Easily accessible
No underlying business directions
No constraint in subjects*
etc.

If a space plans to have DIY stuff, then a building is required. Otherwise, a gazebo at a park would do.

To keep it alive, there has to be someone there.

To keep it growing, there has to be events.

There is no end goal in a public space. Like a special non-evolving pokemon, it stays a public space.

If a group of people find direction, it should not influence the entire space's direction; They are just a group of people in a space, which may do things (create projects). (Though it may help finances and grant-writing)

[todo: need to think more]
--

*Is having no direction possible? A bunch of random mics or meetups often have no results. It will just die. Indeed a direction vs diversity problem. I'm optimistic. It has to be possible. It's entirely up to the people to collaborate and create. It just helps if there is a constraint. But the constraint shouldn't be on the entire space. Instead, just constrain events for creativity.

Should people do work (full-time or temporary) at public spaces? Only if they contribute to the space enough? If it's a free space, like outdoors, then there's no stopping them.

Spaces lack external stimuli. Perhaps meet-ups should alternate locations, or be in transit.

Possible income for spaces in buildings: food (part restaurant!), drinks (part cafe?), sleep (part dormitory? hip travel services?), merchandise, commission whenever a person is hired from the space, door charge for events.

		<title>Maximum Categorical Imperative</title>
		<link>http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/maximum-categorical-imperative</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I know. It sucks that I used a philosophic term. The woes of reading crap other people wrote. Anyway...

Away from home it seems I live by a categorical imperative. I usually live in cities, or travel, and I rarely relax. I live 16 hour days, always doing something. That something may not make sense in hindsight, but at the time, it must have.

If I don't take a break, actions increasingly become minute. Every action is thought of, every thought is thought of, and so on, to the point that I can't act. That's the <em>maximum categorical imperative</em>.
--

During the very end of years of travel (and often when traveling to a different society), I was approaching this maximum. At the end of my time in Taipei, I had a month of no work, so I just walked around, read, and thought a lot. I wasn't a part of society at that time.

When I arrived in New York, I experienced absurdity. I was thrown into society via social obligations, and school. Both of which I chose long ago but wasn't prepared for. No action seemed right, except those required to live.

My mind slowly made sense of the chaos; my brain on fire, trying to figure out what actions to take. Design for aesthetic? Design for practical? Why make media? Why not just act now, in the public, and directly influence people via public art objects or performances? But I was too slow to adapt, and really, I didn't want to. I had my own perspective, larger than New York, or so it felt. I had to postpone school, and New York. To continue school and stay there, I would have had to make sense of those actions first. But I couldn't. I couldn't make sense of how people could make trivial things with technology; I couldn't make sense of what one should make. I disliked the attachment of education to wealth. I felt the school environment restrictive, though thankfully it's in a great city from which to derive all inspiration. How do people make sense of everything?

They don't. One just becomes accustomed to society without thought, and once in society for a long enough period of time, does not think about it.

Coming from another country, recently experiencing a very active period of time, adapting would have required some time, and it did. I went home. And the change from maximum categorical imperative to automaton apathy took nearly three months. It takes three months of prison to destroy a person's will.

[TODO: overlap with absurdity and adaptation]]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[aka Art as Experience?

thoughts from Japan:
<blockquote>before 9/24/13:
Many of the developers have spent years to make a single game. How is that possible? How can one choose to work on something for so long? Braid is one of the few games worth lifetime. It was only two people.</blockquote>

<blockquote>10/25/3
Forget any artwork that takes time to create. You have to stay social and make stuff. You have to maintain happiness. Simple ideas like irons with cameras have the same power as something that takes much longer to make.</blockquote>

The productivity of an artist is measured by the number of novel ideas executed over time.

Banksy said it well:
<blockquote>I use whatever it takes. Sometimes that just means drawing a moustache on a girl's face on some billboard, sometimes that means sweating for days over an intricate drawing. Efficiency is the key.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Humans of New York and Vincent Moon have little to no design, or its all improvised. I like that. Less design, more work.</blockquote>

These two people exemplify these ethics. They live and make a complete product daily, or nearly daily.

Even more creative are those who directly affect others, like educators and good friends.

Fluxus and Zack Gage also come to mind.

When I arrived in New York to attend school, I felt there was no reason to create media, or use computers to do it. This led to ideas like <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/category/art-2/new-media">these</a>.

Media is an unnecessary step, it felt. Why not directly affect people with public art? Heck, even writing the idea in words felt unnecessary. All I could do was draw the idea to convey it, putting the idea on to digital paper.

My intentions were now more political, criticizing society, or shining light upon problems hidden in the artificiality of contemporary cities.

The first goal of art was the political idea it conveyed. The second was how I used current technology to implement it. In that order.

I wanted to disrupt society. I wanted to GPS track rats and post maps of rat pathways on top of subway maps. I wanted to show animals being slaughtered next to fried chicken shops. I wanted to show how bums are being kicked out of public parks by law enforcement for beautification purposes for the wealthy population. I wanted to reflect the twin tower lights on to windows of the offices of banks.

Indeed, an emotional time. But also, perhaps, the greatest.
--

Another thought on these ethics. Following these ethics, one is constantly taking action, creating, something that is an accumulation of all the knowledge one currently has. As one gains more wisdom, the art objects or performances themselves become greater. The oldest people create some of the most knowledgeable art. I think of old filmmakers and writers who expound all of their knowledge into a single art object, their grand narrative, their language-game of life.

I always find it difficult to take a break, read history, non-fiction, without actively creating.

Why do that, when one can live a more progressive lifestyle, creating and learning simultaneously?]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>>9/3/13 in Seoul
When I am alone, everything relies on me. This leads to a dangerous life. I need people for stability, but retain my unstable methods.</blockquote>

<blockquote>8/3/14 short trip on east coast of Taiwan
Detachment from humans leads to disinterest of them. All that can be done [sublimation] during that moment is create on artistic mediums. I believe a mass of knowledge exists within people, a social life, yet I find it so difficult to maintain a constant search for it. People lose their way, and in my attempt of being social, follow them into meaningless. Perhaps it is best to live under Brooklyn Bridge and maintain a social life within the communities of New York.</blockquote>

<blockquote>11/21/14
I read a bit of a tiny book on Descartes last night. He too created a philosophical doctrine out of nothing. He too spectated and then settled in a city with friendly people: Netherlands. One can't get away from people. But one can choose not to interact with them, and instead, just spectate, as a way to form one's own beliefs, without the opinion of others. Other people are death and life of creativity.</blockquote>

To create a set of unique beliefs one must spend most of their time observing reality, for a long period of time. Despite it being the information age, travel and living is still the best method. Especially walking around cities, and sometimes traveling to suburban and rural areas.

That is, until Google offers video footage of people walking in several parts of the world. Then one can have a Veidt style setup of a bunch of monitors playing the footage.

It is on the edge where philosophy and humanistic thoughts begin. It's also where one creates their own ideals for societies, ethics, education, and art.

Jane Jacobs knows urban planning because she lived in a city and spent a lot of time either observing or interacting with it.

From the Wikipedia article on Lyotard about meta-narratives:
<blockquote>Most famously, in La Condition postmoderne: Rapport sur le savoir (The Postmodern Condition: A Report on Knowledge) (1979), he proposes what he calls an extreme simplification of the "postmodern" as an 'incredulity towards meta-narratives'. These meta-narratives—sometimes 'grand narratives'—are grand, large-scale theories and philosophies of the world, such as the progress of history, the knowability of everything by science, and the possibility of absolute freedom. Lyotard argues that we have ceased to believe that narratives of this kind are adequate to represent and contain us all. He points out that no one seemed to agree on what, if anything, was real and everyone had their own perspective and story. We have become alert to difference, diversity, the incompatibility of our aspirations, beliefs and desires, and for that reason postmodernity is characterised by an abundance of micronarratives. For this concept Lyotard draws from the notion of 'language-games' found in the work of Ludwig Wittgenstein. Lyotard notes that it is based on mapping of society according to the concept of the language games.</blockquote>

We all have language-games of history, mind, and society. It is best to create one less influenced by media.]]></content:encoded>

During high school, college, and my first two jobs, I used music as an aid to do work.

This is wrong. One should constantly think (talking to oneself inside one's head) and/or consume, to stimulate brain, and increase chance for reaction.

It's quite easy to simultaneously work and think of something completely different. For my last gig, I was programming while listening to lectures, paying no attention to my work.

I am unsure whether I should consider myself during those years as a human or slave. Music could be a powerful tool for slave-masters.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>>9/3/13The only time I stop is when a street musician is playing.</blockquote>

The combination of a human, performing, in public, is powerful.

More powerful than any media. More powerful than any performance in an artificial environment.

These are humans. They are performing. There is no place in society for them to act this way, or, they don't feel they belong to such a place in society, or, they simply want to perform directly toward humans, so they do it in the public.

The most powerful effect is direct human interaction. Any distance between lessens the effect, and the chance one reacts.]]></content:encoded>

When my creativity and motivation stops, what is the remedy? Travel? Spend time with friends? Meet people?

What will wake me up?

What will get me out of depression?</blockquote>

This is quite common for me. Usually on a high for about 3 months, then a low. I usually struggle getting out of the low. It usually results a change in direction, but that doesn't fit many societies, when a job may have the length of a year. I finish whatever project I'm working on, then move on. This leads to me choosing <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/constant-art-ethics" title="Constant Art Ethics">small projects</a>.

Mood swings are probably associated to my <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/the-life-of-a-nomadic-schizoid" title="The Life of a Nomadic Schizoid">schizoid psychology</a>.

<blockquote>9/20 in Tokyo, Japan
Feeling restless. Not enough social communication. I need friends, work friends, family. Keep creating and talking.

My heart is going to explode if I don't talk to someone.</blockquote>

It really does feel as if my heart were to explode. I desired stimulus that badly. I'm absolutely restless.

<blockquote>~2/14/13 to 8/6/13: in New York
Perhaps the slump hits hard only because I previously never had something I was excited about.
...
I'm neither tiring my mind or body enough to sleep. I must not be outing enough work hours in.</blockquote>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[aka Dean Moriarty ethics
aka On The Road (film)

<blockquote>a thought from the next day:
I was thinking about the scene where Sal parts from Dean in New York, how their lives departed, one toward intellectual pleasures within society, the other, the same old kicks. Who’s life is better? Dean is more free, Sal is constricted to society. Dean struggles with money, Sal, maybe less so.</blockquote>

I didn't mean to write a film review, I actually thought of Dean Moriarty.

Are his ethics wrong?

Dean is embodies <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/hedonism" title="Hedonism">hedonism</a>, yet, he is the main subject of interest. He leads Sal and other artists on adventures. He <em>is</em> the reason the book exists. He may have contributed to the electric Kool-aid experiment too. He continually experiments. He's <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/constant-action-ethics" title="Constant Action Ethics">constantly acting</a>. Though his actions and the consequences of his actions are uneven, he <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/hedonism-and-wisdom" title="Hedonism and Wisdom">learns more</a>, and acts with that knowledge.

What's great about Dean is that he never settles, never gets old. He continues to explore. His understanding of the world and people is immense.

I think Dean is able to bear fruit in experiments because his daily life involves the use of various skills and constant cognitive action. To take trains through America, work part-time jobs, understand modern aesthetics, understand current psyche, naturally leads to dissident thoughts, but it also leads to having great knowledge, and a great mind. A mind quite far from the <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/verbal-language-and-written-language" title="Verbal Language and Written Language">society shaped by written language</a>, yet living in the heart of society, New York. He is a genius inside the body of a working machine. Scientists should have been asking him for answers.

I think of Dean because I was very close to being or even was Dean.

What the difference between Dean and Christopher Doyle, Kevin Kelly, or any other hippie who's partial to the sensual nature of street cultures? Chris picked up a camera and Kevin picked up a pen? Maybe Dean just needed an outlet for creativity, to be taught how to channel his energy. He even asked Sal how to write.

Dean isn't bad. If Dean didn't have kids or ditch friends, he'd be great.

There are many Deans that live in cities, usually aged less than 35. They're not terrible people. For some people, a city is enough.




Thoughts during watching:
Perhaps can have the same experience as the book, in a much faster time.

It already has a better gestalts. Books are so dead. Even if this film is inferior to the book, it's a faster way of gaining knowledge and experience.

Third in jail, third in a pool hall, third in a public library. Not a bad division of time. Think, play, and learn.

Mmm, same problem. One has to live to create. No one creates anything worthwhile while living in isolation, unless that person has experienced much. All that can be written is introspection.

The characters live so much life, yet, they create so little, because their art form is so far from experience. Unlike Banky, who can create new art, object or experience, they are limited to writing. How ancient.

Hmmm, picking cotton. Not much different from Woofing.

Mmmm, dean can't stop living, even rather die than stop. "It's good to have a family, isn't it?"

Haha, no care for the law.

To life.

The dance is great, hah.

Dean gets angry whenever someone stops him.

Hah, Ed Duncal marries for gas money. Such simple causation.

Dean doesn't know the concept of responsibility.

Hah, the daughter is so traditional.

Only Sal sees the positive influences of Dean?

Was benzadrine that popular?

Marylou wants something normal. Normal being house, work, family.

Hmm, this film is so old aesthetically. Can't compare to Hanneke, Farhadi, or other contemporaries.

Hmm, Camille is the best actor. Similar to Melacholia.

Mexico City is indeed heaven.

And Dean ditches him.

Hah, Sal's such a good boy.



Reading Cassady's Wikipedia article:
This is far more informative and real than the film. The facts are so much easier to determine a person. Father was an alcoholic, was on the streets of skid row, improsoned many times, was intelligent and helped by an educator who may have had sex with him, had several sex partners, one gay, 4 kids by two girls.

His hedonistic ethics aren't too bad. He inspired a book, was far more interesting than anyone else. The only lawless thing is having kids and not supporting them. Which he eventually did.

Hmmm, His wife divorced him to help him, but felt that was a mistake as the family was the last pillar of his self-esteem.

"Twenty years of fast living but there's not much left"

Hmmm, regrets his wild life, yet, the people around him love him.




I googled up this analysis from gradesaver.
of the parting scene and end:
The close of the novel finds Sal beginning to settle down with a new love and a new life. Remi Boncoeur's offer to take Sal out on the town in a Cadillac suggests the alternative of a respectable, conventional life. But as Dean shows up with no other intention but to see Sal, Sal wrestles with the feelings of being torn between the two worlds. In the end, Dean cannot enter the Cadillac to go to the opera, just as Sal can no longer follow Dean on the road. Sal has made his choice. As Sal and Dean recede out of one another's vision, one might recall Paul Klee's Angelus Novus, the postmodern "angel of history" as described by Walter Benjamin. This figure has great resonance with Sal's experience.

The novel ends with Sal contemplating the passage of time on a river in New Jersey. For Sal, no ultimate understanding of what "it" is has been accomplished. Sal finally understands that there is no such understanding except that of time moving by and people growing old and fading away. As for Dean, only his memory remains with Sal.

of Mexico City:
To Dean and Sal, Mexico seems to be the promised land that they were looking for on their many journeys. For Sal, Mexico represents the best way out of the conventional white American life. The beer and cigarettes are cheap, they can smoke huge amounts of dope, and they can visit whorehouses anytime they wish. All of this costs little money, and even more importantly, the police and the citizens of Mexico only watch, enthralled by the behavior, allowing it and encouraging it-perhaps because they are Americans. This culture has its own norms, and it is unclear why the travelers should be expected to worry about or even to know about conventional Mexican life.

[Mmm, Taipei also has cheap vices. My vices are just simple pleasures: cheap food, tea, housing, and access to city and nature. But aren't those what everyone wants from a place they live in? The police in Taiwan also don't care, for different reasons, and it does make one feel more free, to be able to sleep anywhere, without a worry for crime. But Taiwanese people also live the same way, they'll sleep anywhere too, if they're tired, or if it's just too hot outside.]

Sal and Dean seem to have no knowledge of Mexican culture and instead see the land around them only in terms of their own situation. The people's poverty, instead of a hardship, seems to be complete freedom. Just as with African American culture, Kerouac's characters again invert the traditional understanding of the repression of racial marginalization and poverty, instead presenting the life of these Mexican people as being gloriously free from the pressures of work and money that are experienced in America. For them, the primitive nature of Mexico is its best feature. Unlike their American journeys, Sal and Dean see their trip to Mexico as a trip to the source of life. Mexican culture seems not to have been touched or corrupted by modernity. In Mexico, there is nothing to run from or to. It is only a culture to be embraced because it seems to stand outside of time and history.

[in Taiwan, it is also difficult to see the hardships, because people are so friendly. I still don't think much of it is hardship, as everyone is educated and fed well, perhaps more so than America. Of course they work, many doing service work, and when I asked them solemnly of they are happy, they said yes. I completely agree with the last sentence. Taiwan and perhaps Mexico are closer to life, as are other happier, island nations. There is a real discontent from developed countries, especially in the middle class. To be near people who are happier is all one really wants, isn't it?]

The culture that Dean, Sal, and Stan experience in the mountains of Mexico stands outside of anything they have ever seen. Realizing that the road they are on is itself a modern construction just ten years old, however, Dean begins to understand that even wilder forms of life live beyond the highway. Yet, because they are still white American men, they may not be able to leave the highway to discover the Mexican subcultures. There remains a divide between what they want to experience and what they are able to experience. Sal despairs in his realization of what the road might mean for such seemingly pure cultures. He thinks about the invention of the atomic bomb, a symbol for the great destruction that modernity has brought, and despairs that one day the roads and bridges of culture will be destroyed along with the possibility of a pure and free existence.

[Mmmm, adaptation is not so much a problem now. There are methods to learn a language easily. And culture too is not difficult to assimilate to.

Where modernity is going is indeed uncertain, especially when one compare happier cultures. People live longer, but do they still live happily?]]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[A thought from Japan:
<blockquote>Is it possible to strive toward something great while living such a balanced life? Life needs tension. Fine art provides this without real life. Without the time and money of going to the slums of India.</blockquote>

A quote from Tsai-Ming Liang:
<blockquote>"I want a few audiences, who have been hurt and worried about life, living, agony and grief, to see my movies."</blockquote>

Human struggle is almost necessary for art. The way one struggles is different in the middle class suburbs and in the city.

In the city, one can visibly see struggle on the streets, and of the many institutions one passes by.

In the suburbs, it's more likely one will only see struggle through art.

There is a difference in the potency of the affect because one is real and one is not. One should, if possible, see it visibly first, then rely on media, or else there will be a detachment of reality.]]></content:encoded>

No school makes sense. Go by pure motivation. Fuck anything else.</blockquote>

<blockquote>9/22/13 in Tokyo, Japan
The only way I learn is by creating via motivation. There is no other way. No point of forcing myself to learn.</blockquote>

A thought soon after moving to Taiwan:
<blockquote>Dont let anyone take you in the wrong direction. You don't have to spend time learning chinese with classmates if it doesn't motivate you. Learn it in your own way. It's more fun, more serious, much more interesting, in my view. See the beauty in the world.</blockquote>

<blockquote>
10/15/13
Learn by doing. There is no other way. There's not enough motivation otherwise.</blockquote>

<blockquote>
unknown date:
I didn’t need school for stimulation; A city provides that.</blockquote>

Perhaps I should live alone in a shitty room in Tonghua.</blockquote>

Unlike the <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/the-ideal-neighborhood" title="The Ideal Neighborhood">neighborhood</a>, the household doesn't matter much.

If one is single, it could be just a small space to safely keep belongings and sleep in. If the country doesn't provide cheap and healthy food, then there must be a kitchen.

If one has roommates, then perhaps it would have a living room that has an appearance similar to one's dream cafe.

If one a family, then I still think it should resemble a dream cafe, with more play space.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[aka <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_psychology">functional psychology?</a>

<blockquote>In Seoul:
When moving from an undeveloped to developed country, the increase in money and conspicuous consumption hits me. The needs are the same, yet the only difference is money. People get used to this life. People don't think about minimizing their belongings, or using less money in daily life. They have a job and its salary determines their lifestyle. It's non-sensical.</blockquote>

<blockquote>>9/3/13
I adapt to my surroundings. In Seoul I eat what's around me, at that price, and sleep at a nice hostel. I could have slept outside and eaten cheaper food, but I didn't. I socialized with the people at my hostel. I wandered around hongdae. Because it was close. I spent more money because I was becoming lazy. I became used to the people around me. I stopped caring about them.</blockquote>

Before adapting to society, I go through an <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/absurdism" title="Absurdism">absurd</a> phase.

<blockquote>10/11/13 Back in America
From a good vantage point,  the wedding is similar to those villages in Southeast Asia -- an unfamiliar social custom. This, even more inaccessible, as the village only requires going there whereas the hotel has a high cost.</blockquote>

When I came back to America, society was even more absurd than those in traditional societies. It felt so far from nature, so artificial.

In this particular case, attending an Indian wedding in America, really is non-sensical because it's a tradition transposed atop a different society.

A decorated horse is replaced by an expensive car. Stealing shoes from the groom meant he had to walk back barefoot, in addition to losing a nice pair of wedding shoes; Now it's possible for the groom to either follow tradition and give money in exchange, or just wear another pair. Food cooked in large cauldrons rather cheaply from nearby farmers have been replaced by catering from an expensive restaurant.

Traditions are fine. The influence of materialism is not. India is a really odd society in which the two mingle. Full of tradition and materialism, at least, in the upper classes.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It's hard to imagine.

Just a few decades ago, there was only books, newspapers, magazines, comic books, posters, and televisions with a few channels.

I feel that the less information there is, to a certain point, the less likely one will believe at face value, question it, and perhaps, react to it.

Now, that there is so much information, it seems people have become more indifferent to media. Do Americans shrug at imperialism, knowing but not caring? Or is it the discontentment of failed urban planning and a failed government?

I can't imagine solidarity in action similar to Taiwan and Hong Kong in America. Does America even have the protest experience and institutions anymore?]]></content:encoded>

It's extremely important to choose great jobs. The highest of design. Learn languages as quick as possible. Be social. Practice. Take it seriously. Learning is key for the future. Don't just think about the poor, do something about it!</blockquote>

I often experience something that evokes a strong emotional response, but don't know how to rationally react to it, and rather want to create art out of it. Is it absurdity or ignorance?

<blockquote>9/19/13 in Japan
I was at my height of senses in Hong Kong because I was transitioning from a developing county to a developed one. That is how I should think all of the time. But then, if I did, I wouldn't have friends. It's tough to live in that state of mind. One has to step down. </blockquote>

Absurdity is hit often when I go from a developed country to a developing country, and vice versa.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>>9/3/13
My creativity is completely gone. I'm paying for an expensive hostel without thought of work. I'm working on old things without thought. I need some inspiration.</blockquote>

Impulsivity dissipates the longer I stay inside a house. This included my parent's house, my family's house in India, and, a friendly hostel in Seoul.

It's surprising I lost impulsivity in the hostel in Seoul. But like Japan, South Korea is nearly entirely developed, with people inside buildings. Even the parks are artificial.

The more time I spend on the street, the more impulsive I am. Travel being the best. This harks Rimbaud's biography and Dean Mortiarty as extreme examples.

<blockquote>>9/3/13Cars are terrible. It's like a house on wheels.</blockquote>

When one is inside a car, one doesn't interact with the world, only with what's inside the car. The difference of a opening a window is huge.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>>>9/3/13 in Busan
Koreans and probably Japanese favor clean, cute places, and at temples they remove the authenticity of it, transforming it into something they enjoy, instead of appreciating the original beauty of it.

Their neat and organized characteristics of cafes continue on to temples. The past has disappeared not solely because of the recent influx of money, but because of their culture. They destroyed their past. Too clean for it.</blockquote>

I believe these thoughts came to me when I went to Busan, then a hostel, then we drove together to a temple. Driving to a temple itself was already hypocritical. It's always odd to see tradition in a developed society, but here it seemed the contrast was even higher.

It was odd to go to Japan and Korea and not be able to get the feeling of being transported to an ancient civilization. Both repaired or even rebuilt their temples to fit the wants of current society, perhaps for tourism.

I'm told Juju island is basically a tourist attraction now.

Japanese people have gardening down to an art. That is exemplary of shaping nature to human wants.

Do these societies not appreciate the sublimity of nature? The rustic? The past?

Contrarily, compared to my experience in suburban American, they seem more appreciative of nature. Walking around parks and taking trips to the country is the norm.]]></content:encoded>

In a few days in Seoul, I felt I had a good group of friends. In a few days in Busan, life was hopeless. How the accessibility to other people affects social life is clear.]]></content:encoded>

The power of media is reminded as people from Mexico say that Korean drama and pop is popular. Meh, I don't care for it.</blockquote>

It's possible that person was influenced by media to see another society. Unfortunately, the pop media doesn't reflect society realistically, and then people are disappointed.

I was somewhat interested in Japan due to games I played as a child, notably, Final Fantasy. After experiencing the life of Southeast Asia, I had no interest in Japan because I felt their culture was insular. When I went, I felt I was in a land of suburbs, where people consume media. The only fantasy was that in the game. The reality was people consuming it.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>9/13/13 in Busan
I only had 5 hours of sleep, yet I feel relaxed. I can learn. The suburbs are a good place to focus on learning. There are too many distractions in the city, and while traveling. But now I'm lacking motivation to create new things, or  have new experiences.</blockquote>

The suburbs are deprived of life. It makes a good place for a child to learn through media. The difficulty of media studies is to relate it to reality. The more distance between the societies, the more power it takes to consider actions seriously, and critically think about. The more one is distanced from society, say the isolation provided by a house, the more one can see it as reality (huh? doesn't sound right). One can read the Iliad, but how many people think of that society as real? It is real. Read about wars in New Guinea from Jared Diamond and one will see that those ideas in The Iliad are real; It's a series of battles and rituals. But if one lives in the same society an entire life, it really is quite difficult.

Media that adheres to realism are the best because they mirror human nature. Realist artists such as Tolstoy and Ozu are classic because of this characteristic.

Documentaries are good too, but difficult to display in a structure as aesthetically appealing as fiction.



<blockquote>>6/28/13 in Hong Kong:
It doesn't make sense to watch movies while traveling. I’d rather spend time living. Talking to people, exploring.</blockquote>

Conversely, it is very difficult to experience media while living a very active life. During my two years away from America, I watched perhaps a handful of films, read no books, listening mostly to local music. It didn't make sense to consume media, novelty was a walk away, experience could be created within the vicinity. I felt all media was so far from reality there was no reason ever to watch a film. I just kept thinking of what the director was doing to make the film. It led me to only care about experience-related art -- public games, new media, and performances.

At the end of travels, I was able to consume philosophy and non-fiction, because then there was no acting, and the knowledge was more direct.



<blockquote>8/3/14
A thought after listening to today's lecture going in to post-modernism.

It is indeed scary that people cannot differentiate reality from media. That their favorite icons are not their real friends.

And perhaps that is what scares me about America. I am highly adaptable. If I live in America, I live a post-modern life, consuming more film than reality. I see the poor in films, not in reality. If I live in Asia, I live a traditional life. I am attached to reality. I see the poor in real life, media doesn't affect me, and often, I don't want to consume media because life is more valuable.

Perhaps it's a matter of age. One should consume media because one can learn a lot, and quick, quicker than teachers can teach. But later in life, one must detach from media and stay connected with the world, only consuming reality, non-fiction.</blockquote>

Media studies is a great education, but should be done in a lively environment.

<blockquote>To not react to the world is to die? No, it's introspection. One has built up so many reactions in ones life, one is able to think, even without external stimulus. Only a newborn who has no external stimulus will know nothing.

What's the difference in growing up in a post modern society and a traditional one? The knowledge gained is the same. The difference is that people in a post modern world are unable to differentiate what's real and what's media.</blockquote>

It's much harder to reacty impulsively to media.

<blockquote>8/9/14
Media really is the only outlet to the suburbs. Films served as a telescope to the world.

My house has no books, films, games, culture. It is blank, except of those stashed in my cabinet. In a house in the suburbs, the world is inside cabinets.
</blockquote>

True dat.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>In happier places, Southeast Asia and Taiwan, people tend to be happier with simple everyday interactions and sensory input: food, taking a picture with friends or even oneself, clothes, a short trip to nature, a short trip to get some bubble milk tea, a short stroll through a night market. Simple everyday pleasures; feed those impulses immediately. Overall it seems a more natural state of life, especially when compared to developed countries.</blockquote>

When I live in a densely-populated, social, and generally happy environment, such as a hostel in Southeast Asia, the simple pleasures of life are enough.

Equally, I felt it's enough for the people too, as they stroll day markets and night markets, socialize with neighbors, friends, and family, all of it whilst being thrifty. Southeast Asia is Epicureanism at its finest.

<blockquote>9/23/13 in Tokyo
I’m focusing too much on fine art as opposed to the things around me as I did while traveling.</blockquote>

When I live in the suburbs, or even in a large city that feels like one, such as Tokyo, I gravitate toward fine pleasures.

I feel the romanticism and universality of the former is better than the inclusiveness of the latter.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The characteristics are:
One that contains knowledge
One that directly affects humans via physical interaction.
One that is social
One that is beautiful

These are also forms of pleasure.

Physical interaction can be satisfied without manmade objects; The sublimity of nature is enough. So is eating and exercise.

In another view:
One that affects the mind, and
One that affects the body

The potency of art depends on the potency of the characteristics of the art and the audience. A more sensual art more strongly affects a more sensual person. A more mindful art more strongly affects a more rational person more. Beautiful and social arts affects everyone.

The more potent, the greater chance of reacting to it.

If social, potency, and therefore chance of reacting, is multiplied.

Hmm, is a social experience the end?

Or the beginning of another?

		<title>Fear of Solitude in America</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[When going from a densely populated area to a sparsely populated one, perhaps in addition to the lack of social liveliness, a fear of solitude comes about.

Simply, if one human is having a problem, without another within vicinity, how will that person get over it?

Densely populated areas feel safe because there are more people. More people more justice.

More desolate areas allow have more space between people and less light. Both of which attract petty crimes.

Favelas are populated, yet have crimes.

Are those crimes only restricted to dark alleys and unlit pathways?
--

Another thought.

If one grows in a house where one is accustomed to lock the door, turn on lights at night, come home before night, never walk alone, never go out without a car, a fear to go out, and perhaps a fear to meet people ("strangers") could develop.
--

Another.

The lack of crime in East Asia is factor of freedom. One doesn't worry about where they are, how, or when they will get home. Sleeping outside is a viable option.

I can't say the same for America, especially suburban America, even after traveling.

I had a more positive view during my nights in New York after travel, but there's still a bit of insecurity.

When I came back to New York, I decided, out of exhaustion, convenience, and change in cost of living, to sleep in Washington Square park. There were a few bums playing music and a few drunk university kids enjoying it, both equally harmless. Later there were just drunk university kids. I believe, the bums were cleared out by the police (I've seen them clearing bums out on a different day).

Over-policing cause the bums to continually move toward other covers from wind for warmth: under bridges, in subways stations, in underpasses. An unfortunate migratory pattern.

From my experience in East Asia, I did not see this. A homeless person, and even people with homes -- a drunk university kid, and a businessman, could sleep in a public park. They appear quite alright, perhaps tired from the world, but unagitated.

<a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/homeless-asians" title="Homeless Asians">Homeless Asians are special</a>, especially so when seen in the developed world.

Property is a concept I struggle to understand. To pay an enormous amount of money for space above earth. Does this directly derive from slave and slave-masters? Shouldn't this concept be dead in the Information Age? [todo: read Debt: The First 5000 Years]

Even after much travels, the place I fear the most is where I am now: a large house in a gated community. A whistle is useless here.]]></content:encoded>

~2/14/13 to 8/6/13 in New York
Why do bums live on?</blockquote>

Homeless East Asians are special. Testaments of the crime-less, thrifty ethics of East Asians; Modest modern scavengers of urban waste a la recyclables, they fertilize the city's sidewalks every night, take care of the city like under-appreciated mothers do their shit-spewing babies.

I've always had a fascination with bums since I first moved to a city. A fascination for the human condition perhaps. They are incredible beings.

The Asian kind, especially. I feel no difference between the Asian recycling ladies of New York and certain night market vendors of Taipei whom clean the streets every night. Perhaps they are the same. I walk down the streets with them, comforted by their presence, inspired.

Wherever I settle, I hope they are always near.]]></content:encoded>

Even then, isn't it better to <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/constant-progressive-action-ethics" title="Constant Progressive Action Ethics"> constantly act </a> with what knowledge one has?

Education is just the passing of immaterial knowledge, which can be gained through material (art objects, artificial) or through humans (talking, observing).

If one does not stop to craft or write, knowledge still accumulates. There are only a few reasons to write, for documentation (history), aesthetic (literature, near dead), and to argue ideas (science and philosophy).

I thought the process of writing would incite ideation of things I learned via non-verbal empiricism over the past few years. I thought that peering through my own repetitive scattered thoughts would lead to confirming of beliefs. Instead, it merely led to learning language. Though nice, I still consider it failure. This is because either, I didn't try hard enough to write (try arguing more, or writing a philosophic treatise!), or, that learning occurs when experiencing, writing not being considered an experience.

I am still severely lacking ability to vocalize thoughts and ideas, but should it be limited to verbal language? As a person who grew up with film as an education, I could continue to live and create without knowing the words materialism, bad faith (Sartre's), and epicureanism, but knowing the ideas behind them. Of course, I would be able to speak and argue better, but my point is, it's not necessary. <strong>Conceptual metaphors do not require language</strong>. Perhaps <strong>this is my source of anti-intellectual air</strong>. I have no patience for words. Give me video. Frame it in a fun way. <strong>Perhaps this is where progressive artists and academia divide</strong>. Further, I feel <strong>it hinders creativity</strong>. Ideas can be created from materials, not just letters. Why use the words some philosopher or scientist used? Reading what others makes one prone to dogma. It's more memorable to create one's own words or references. Of course, contrarily, it hinder's one's ability to have modern conversation through written language.

I think the only way to write is to write down thoughts, letters, speeches, and record conversations, while simultaneously experiencing. This way, written language is only used during experiential times. Looking back at thoughts is something one does at a very old age, or, if great enough, someone else will discover it and do the tedious work for you.

From <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/i-still-dont-understand" title="I Still Don’t Understand">I Still Don't Understand</a>:

<blockquote>After all this recent milling about via written language, I feel my gut was right all along. I knew everything I've written already. My convictions are the same as before. <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/no-more-writing" title="No more writing">Writing it down wasn't required.</a></blockquote>

Now I'm starting to believe very few people have the linguistic ability to convey what they are actually thinking, and taking the time to verbalize (down to specific terms) is wasteful. People who live the most <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/i-think-of-dean-moriarty" title="I think of Dean Moriarty">active lives</a> are making decisions at lightning speed based on their current knowledge. People are decision-making machines. These people should be the subject of cognitive science. People live in a way so that they use the least amount of time explain a something, so they can continue taking action. If jargon suffices, why use a more specific term? A single word of jargon could have several meanings (conceptual metaphors). Watch any stand-up comedy; Count how many definitions of nigga there are.

If it works, don't fix it. And what is meant there is, if having a small vocabulary works, why spend the time learning the words to apply to meanings (target domain?).

Again, I feel this is a source of perceived anti-intellectualism, and where "street smart" divides from academia smart -- It's just difference in capacity of language. And being a person who has spend a lot of time in the streets, played video games, watched films, explored cities by the streets, who's friends similarly may be considered street-kids, hipster, hippies, or simply <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/conciseness-in-art">choose not to be wordy (a good virtue)</a>, I too suffer from having a low capacity of language.

The con of this is losing access to knowledge, sometimes found in the form of giant books, though <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/information-media-and-education" title="Information, Media, Education, and Power">the world has now come a far way in media</a>, to enter modern conversation in science, history, and philosophy, it almost seems required. <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/a-personal-journey-through-books" title="A Personal Journey through Books">I personally suffered a huge learning curve in books</a>. What is the point of creating something so inaccessible? <strong>Is it the duty of an artist to make knowledge accessible?</strong>

Well, I guess the knowledge has to come out somehow, and if it takes a big fat book to make an argument, so be it. But I highly doubt it's required, and I'm more certain that the concepts could be transmitted more efficiently in another form. I'm starting to now think that <strong>it is indeed the artists that make the world smarter, not the esoteric elite</strong>. The elite keep knowledge to themselves. The artist spreads the knowledge to the people. <strong>The best educators <em>are</em> artists</strong>, and, perhaps, vice versa.

Even now, academia sit in offices in a university reading a pile of books. Someone once said history is best way to learn about human nature. I only half-agree. Nothing beats historical facts when studying politics, especially when compared to say, fictional art objects. Chomsky's life seems to involve reading a lot of books in MIT, then talking about it to interviewers. It worked for him. He's smart. But it's just one way. And reading history mostly limits things to politics. It entirely misses the sensual part of life, what people really think, which is where art comes in. But in a far more fun way, one could simply live; just walk around a city, look at things, and if one has time off, travel. Look at modern civilization, then look at less developed ones. Living a lot of life also can lead to a lot of knowledge, but it results in differences of how knowledge is obtained -- there's less words, and it's probably more sensually satisfying.

Perhaps this is all a result of living a very lively life, then putting oneself into isolation. Such strong feelings for nomadic life, and against a sedentary life.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Reading and Listening to eBooks</title>
		<link>http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/reading-and-listening-to-ebooks</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[After listening to a great lecture series on philosophy from The Great Courses, I thought listening to lectures and books (with the addition of films and games) <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/the-obsolescence-of-literature-and-the-future-of-education">surely replaced the ancient knowledge transmission through reading</a>. And for the most part, I agree.

But there are still quite a few books I'd like to read, and in the Information Age, it seems the methods to get them are contrarily not so simple. Furthermore if one wanted to do research, then going to the library or building a personal one still seems the best way. Skimming through a bunch of eBooks sucks.

Recently, I bought a Kindle. It's beautiful, but just too slow, I was unable to gauge the content of a books. It may be okay for literature, where one is likely to read the thing entirely, but for knowledge, research, or just general playful reading, it's useless. I returned it, and instead ordered an iPad Mini.

The Kindle app for iOS is free, but the library can be expensive, and sometimes, the format is inferior to the actual book, missing pictures or linkable items.

Then I read somewhere that some eBook readers can link to Dropbox to read eBooks. Great! Then I found <strong>Voice Dream Reader</strong>. It is the best application I've found to read AND listen to eBooks. The application excels because both options are available simultaneously; The text being read is highlighted, and one can start and stop audio at any point in the text. This makes it superior to audiobooks, the Kindle, and real books. With audiobooks, one can't gauge the contents, and skimming is fruitful, especially without any sort of markers (future feature of audio books?). Another great feat is that it keeps the original format and can convert the format on the fly to a more readable version similar to Kindle. The original formatting is nearly always superior, even if it doesn't quite fit on the iPhone screen. The only time to use the readable version is for long-form reading, or passive reading of fiction. Lastly, it is superior to actual books because it offers the ability to provide audio, freeing the eyes.

The app has a slew of options and is quite customizable. It handles epub, PDF, and word documents (no Kindle formats though). The voice is pretty darn good, I feel happy at 250 to 300 words / minutes; Any slower and my mind wonders. There's highlighting and notes, which is kind of a pain on iPhone because the text is so small, but perhaps better on iPad. Like the Kindle, one can highlight words and search it in a dictionary or wikipedia. It is indeed a dream. I can choose books from dropbox, skim through the original format like a Wikipedia article, begin listening to any part of it, or read it like a Kindle.

Though this is the best way I've found to read eBooks, I still find it inferior to a public or a personal library of books, but not by much. I used the Mac Kindle application to read The 21st Century Backpacker's Bible because it was free on Kindle Unlimited (free for one month). I used Voice Dream Reader on iPhone to read some of Debt: The First 5000 years. I still haven't received the iPad mini yet.

It's still quite painful to find ePubs or PDFs. There a quite a bunch of online bookstores, free and not. Googling seems to be the best way to cover them all. Thankfully having access to Dropbox makes organization painless.

<a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/nomadism-culture-and-the-playful-quest-for-knowledge">eBooks are important to me as I can't have any books while traveling</a>, they just weigh too much. Furthermore, from my experience in libraries and bookshops in Taipei, most selections are translated to Chinese. My goal was to devise a method of reading and listening while traveling, and it seems an eBook reader <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/a-liberal-arts-self-study-curriculum">in conjunction of other medias</a>, is the way to go.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Creativity as Organization from Chaos</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The further one is from society, the more disorganized the world appears.

The more disorganized the world appears during the time of creation, the more creative the result.

Why?

It is the distance between disorganization and organization that determines the level of aesthetic beauty.

It is up to the mind to organize chaos.
--

Seems to be a repeat of an old thought: <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/information-organization-mediums-creativity-and-experience" title="Information Organization, Mediums, Creativity, and Experience"></a>
--

If this is the case, then it is best to <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/living-on-the-edge-of-society-ethics" title="Living on the Edge of Society Ethics">live on the edge of society</a>. Cities are the most potent area of human organization. One needs distance, surround oneself with less common materials, then create. It will also lead to a more creatively efficient lifestyle, as the mind struggle to piece together the world into new designs and ideas.

It used to be in order to have social connections, display work, one had to live in cities. With the internet, it is no more.
--

During certain points in travel I came with these ideas:
A public vending machine for barter. The machine allows a user to place one item inside and take one item out.

GPS track a pigeon and/or a dancer to get flight pattern data for a robotic dodo bird.

A film that contains video footage of a GoPro camera traveling around Taiwan, using JRPG music to fit the natural and artificial settings.

A film from real video footage of animals in the jungle to display high culture ideas of humans.

Live robot exhibition. I am the robot. The robot moves depending on interaction (touch, possibly other senses) according to a set if rules. There is a pattern to find. The winner gets a candy.

An art installation dealing with video game memory cards.

A multi-player game installation in which the game installations are physically separated, but have a map to one other installation.

A smartphone application that allows users to create things in real space, allowing people to interact with a digital world atop a real one.

		<title>艾未未：道歉你妹 (Ai Wei Wei: Never Sorry)</title>
		<link>http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/ai-wei-wei-never-sorry</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This is a review of my thoughts during the viewing of the film.

他也有被遺棄的工廠。
<a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/living-on-the-edge-of-society-ethics" title="Living on the Edge of Society Ethics">Living on the edge of society</a> to create art. People who are closer to or are idealists must live on the edge of society for their mind to be able to maintain such ideas. Living inside of a city doesn't allow the space to think such a way. There are so many ideas in cities that are different than one's utopia that one must step back, or in this case, out.

在奧林匹克的時候他感覺他做不好的東西。他的作品換新中國的政治學，他知道後果。
I think this point was pivotal for him. He came out of college in New York with design and art on his mind. He participates in a grand project. But aware of the consequences, he became more political after this point.

他每天寫博客。
For the sake of confirming beliefs or dissident documentary? Looks like there's a book that contains his blog from MIT Press now.

如果藝術人沒做事，他寫事。
Seems common of any artist. One has to keep creating! But any other form of art is superior to writing. He did well in New York, meeting people, creating exhibitions. Perhaps it is best to be part of society.

「一共的做事。」
Solidarity. Do something that is right and people will follow.

「不是藝術的關係，是每一個人的關係」。
More solidarity. It's interesting to try to find a point where political art divides into art and politics. Many artists act with great political knowledge.

他用了博客跟紀錄片記錄事。
Using the blog as a documentary tool. And later, Twitter, which enabled social gatherings.

「網路有力，因為給人機會改變人的意見。」
The internet enables common people to change the opinion of people.

It's interesting that people didn't use the internet to simply gain knowledge, say reading Wikipedia, instead rely on artists to feed the information to them in a more amusing form. One could easily read the Wikipedia article of the earthquakes in a minute, but it took an hour-long documentary to shove the same information in the minds of people. Though, I'm one of those people. Is it the pathos? Is it because film as a medium offers more information (visual data)? <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/information-media-and-education" title="Information, Media, and Education">The closer to real experience, the more powerful the reaction</a>.

藝術是今天的語言。*
Art is modern language. This was quite profound to me. <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/social-determinism-travel-and-aesthetics" title="Social Determinism, Travel, and Aesthetics">I struggled in the past having learned art in New York and then being unable to talk about art in other countries</a>. I will talk more about this when he moves from New York to China.

At another point he upholds the common view art is communication. Artists communicate by creating art. It is just a form of communication, like written, verbal, and body languages.

Why does it take a modern artist to be listened to? So many say and write the same things a modern artist says, yet the modern artist gains the power and attention. From Tate to a person with several followers. Again, the artist's form of communication is more powerful than data. The experience of reading 5000 people are dead in a paper is different from walking around 5000 dead bodies.

If art is a way more powerful way of communicating, then it may be true that an artist who constantly creates art is more influential than one who does not.

「你得表現批判。」* 看的好容易。
By simply documenting the simple, rational actions he took, he makes strong criticism of society.

得開始理想的社會。*
...
他說他是永恆樂天派。
...
他只要教人。
He's very ideal. I think one has to construct an utopia, then try to shape reality toward it. It's a conscious effort among those with sufficient knowledge. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavoj_%C5%BDi%C5%BEek#Ontology.2C_ideology.2C_and_the_Real">But it seems that the creation of art is kind of unconscious</a>.

In his reactions to police and reporters, he acts no different than as if it were a friend. He behaves as if he would in his own house, and expects others to do so too.

He even later says he's an "eternal optimist". He feels positive changes are possible and happening.

He just wants to teach people. The world is his students. In his documentaries people refer to him as 艾老師, Ai teacher. It's a fundamental desire to want to teach people.

他也愛紐約。
:). It seems New York served as a place of freedom for him.

自由很怪。經歷自由你不可能忘了。個人非常強，比較國家強。
It seems quite true in his life; After New York he has never acted anything close to a slave.

在紐約他十二的年做難。
He even worked at Second Avenue Deli!. He must have spent quite a bit of time exploring those streets. Oh man, now I want to go back to a city!

他抗議，也看了Iran的審訊。
Learning from contemporary history in a progressive manner.

中國沒有藝術。
...
如果沒有人做藝術，你得創造藝術的社會。 總是有藝術人。你得跟他們說話，較。
He struggled going back to China because there was no modern art, especially not near modern as New York. But artists exist everywhere. One just needs to create a community, and they will come. One needs to educate them, then continue talking about it.

Now that there's internet, it would seem that this is a moot point, but it is not. In my experience, many countries still uphold very traditional arts, which is promulgated by universities, which itself is likely promulgated by government. Even now in Taiwan there are universities that hold traditional arts higher than contemporary. Though, that is not a criticism of Taiwan, as it has only recently been lifted from martial law.

Whereas Ai was able to create a community and continue creating the way he did in New York, I was unable to create a community of the art I enjoyed (games), and instead diverting my attention toward more universally appreciated modern arts (HONY). I did this because <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/constant-art-ethics" title="Constant Art Ethics">I couldn't stop I had to keep taking action with the knowledge I had</a>. I had to keep creating, and consuming, and the people around me must be able to understand it. Why spend the time to educate people people on modern art? I could have gone back to New York, or they could use the internet to see it. I didn't understand why Asia's aesthetics were so far behind the experimental communities of New York.

"Why spend the time to educate people people on modern art?" is a good question. Is <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/learning-the-aesthetics-of-art" title="Learning the Aesthetics of Art">knowledge of aesthetics</a> necessary to create something new? No. I often feel that if one doesn't know what modern art is, one is likely going to be even more creative. Though, from my experience, I don't remember any time where I saw an amazing art by a person away from modern society. The concepts are ancient: writing, painting, crafting, plays. Though, traditional games are awesome.

「藝術是方法發展新的意見。 是藝術人的職責保護。」
"Art is a way of developing new ideas." I think he meant, art is a way of expressing idea, as opposed to developing new aesthetics.

"It is up to artists to protect freedom of expression." That makes sense. Artists need to express themselves, and if they encounter a situation where they can't, they fight for it.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Perhaps another thought of the decision between New York and away from the developed world.

More likely, quite possible this feeling of inaction is merely a reaction of being cooped up at my parent's house in the cold winter. <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/the-effects-of-weather" title="The Effects of Weather">I hate the cold</a>.

It should be up to society, not just education, to channel people, at all levels, toward taking ethically satisfactory actions.

To live in a society where one has to constantly, consciously and unconsciously, make decisions to avoid doing wrong, especially in simple daily actions such as buying food and discarding trash, to ignore indoctrination and propaganda, obvious or not, is the result of a failed society.

All nations suffer from these things. No nation is pristine; Shit is prevalent.

Yet, because less developed societies are just that, the problems are less developed too. Government may be corrupted, but people at least know what they're eating, drinking, where their trash is going, how their dwelling was made, who their children's teachers are, have less equality problems, and can afford and/or have free emergency healthcare. Also, with less money, there's less chance of government committing large-scale wrongdoing such as imperialistic wars.

The intelligent people of developed countries create independent communities, make the right decisions, advocates these decisions, but it all seems for sake of unraveling a society that developed so far into the wrong side of the spectrum, that if one steps back, the changes are minute.

What keep these [intelligent, privileged] people seated is their love for the people. Jon Stewart loves New York, and America, and somehow, it's become his duty to deflate TV propaganda. <strong>Every community in New York is based on a love of the people; It has nothing to do with the country</strong> (save the Constitution). These people will exist, as they do all over the world, no matter what society they are in. They're educated and developed their own values in society. They often have no ties with the government and resist it, form NGOs, or other <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/the-ideal-public-space" title="The Ideal Public Space">public spaces</a>, and do good in their own way. It may seem anarchist, but it's natural.

What is one to do? Activism. If Chomsky is right, as long as the nation is persistent, it should work.

A personal question, perhaps self-interested, is it wrong to move elsewhere? Let the developed society collapse [todo: read How Societies Collapse]. One wouldn't have to deal with as much indoctrination or propaganda, and, of great influence, one wouldn't feel they are contributing to the downward progress of society. Instead of undoing a backward society, one would be progressing a less developed society, hopefully closer to a better direction.

During my travels I rarely felt I made ethically poor decisions. Perhaps air travel was the worst feeling (why can't I sit in a baggage compartment?), and the random expensive hipster cafes. Otherwise it was merely giving money to small restaurants and hostels. The money could have gone to better places, but I also could see exactly where it was going, and those people were nice.

To move elsewhere requires one to either detach from friends and family (not bad with technology) or try to sway more to move together. Luckily, I haven't quite settled anywhere, but I would still only be able to communicate to family via technology, and a person who <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/social-life-in-proximity" title="Social Life in Proximity">communicates in proximity</a>, that's a problem.

I think I mentioned before that, when coming from Taiwan to New York, <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/adaptation" title="Adaptation">I had trouble</a> coming to terms with what the artificial meant, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7954936-what-technology-wants">what technology wants</a>, and <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/information-media-and-education" title="Information, Media, Education, and Power">what media wants</a>. And after much time, I still don't understand. And until I do, I kind of feel I don't want to be a part of it [developed world].

It just doesn't make sense. <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/creativity-as-organization-from-chaos" title="Creativity as Organization from Chaos">I've even felt that living elsewhere has a positive influence on creativity</a>.

After all this recent milling about via written language, I feel my gut was right all along. I knew everything I've written already. My convictions are the same as before. <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/no-more-writing" title="No more writing">Writing it down wasn't required.</a>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[aka In Praise of Taiwan

[todo: way too long, accumulates several ideas, need to clean up.]

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Still_Walking_%28film%29">When one is away from their home, forced to be in a place they don't want be in</a>, one becomes homesick.

An artist's home often isn't just a dwelling. It's a community, which could be in the form of a group of people, a city, a country, or even the world. It's a place where one feels the urge to take action. The artist belongs in an active place, and desires it, though breaks may be needed (or breakdowns if one fails to take a break).

Now, away from a home and in isolation for nearly half a year, I can hear two: New York and Taiwan.

Since my stays in both of them, they've been on my mind, as a place I tell myself that I'm going to come back to.

From personal experience, I know the environment affects me greatly. Whether that's a lack of willpower or responsibilities doesn't matter. It affects my social construction of the world and what I do -- for work and art. Therefore, the choice in environment is the greatest.

In <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/searching-for-the-greatest-environment-ethics" title="Searching for the Greatest Environment Ethics">Searching for the Greatest Environment Ethics</a>, I came to the conclusion that:
<blockquote>A single small community is exclusive (the reason for my apathy of college towns). The community must be inclusive. A community of communities, including public interaction — a city, or even a country.</blockquote>
An inclusive city or country is better than an exclusive institution.

In <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/philosophy-from-media-versus-life-new-york-versus-the-world" title="Philosophy from Media versus Life; New York versus the World">Philosophy from Media versus Life; New York versus the World</a> I questioned:
<blockquote>Does America consume more media than the rest of the world? Especially compared to social nations such as those in South East Asia and Taiwan?</blockquote>

I don't think so. Taiwanese people consume a lot of media too. But the way they consume it is different. They do it while living a very lively life, and use their phones to watch television or movies. I've only seen old people sit at home and watch television. This contrasts greatly with the suburbs, where media is consumed solely.

<blockquote>All one needs is a few good relationships, creative ones, and both would work.</blockquote>

Now I begin to question this, is a few good relationships really enough to make up for the deficit of good characteristics of the environment?

From <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/public-places" title="Public Places (and Public Spaces?)">Public Places</a>:
<blockquote>In East Asia, it didn’t matter where I slept; There’s no crime there. I’d sleep when I was tired, or at a friend’s house, or at a park. It cut commute time.

In Taiwan, it didn’t matter where I ate. The food was cheap enough to eat anywhere. There was no reason to go home. I could eat, sleep, work, anywhere. Absolute freedom.</blockquote>

Though I feel quite confident in nearly every part of the world, there is a bit more freedom felt when crime does not exist. As a night person who enjoys the company of people awake at night, or just strolling around at night, this is much appreciated. It enables me to stay active day and night, regardless of when I am awake.

Though I could live with a box of cereal and some fresh fruit in my backpack, the prevalence of cheap food allows me to worry about one less thing. And this thing is important as it's required for survival. It being delicious and healthy are extra.

<blockquote>Public Places as a Savior from Commoditization:
Public places in cities I think are closely associated to freedom. The sense of freedom gets lost in social norms of the artificial. People are conditioned to sleep at home, cook and eat at home, work in offices, and work more at home or at a cafe, leaving bars as the only place to socialize. This is the result of commoditization, people feel (and often do) that they have to pay to use a computer, pay to rent a book or dvd, pay to sleep, pay a cafe to use the internet, pay to park, pay to sleep, pay to travel, pay to pitch a tent, pay to drink water, pay to wash clothes. Without a healthy street life, worse, in the suburbs, it’s possible that people live without knowing they could actually meet friends at a park, have a barbecue, and enjoy.</blockquote>

Though I've become quite resistant toward commodities and an adherant of <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/minimalism-ethics" title="Minimalism Ethics">minimalism ethics</a>, I fear that over time that it may be possible to recondition my mind toward more capitalistic behavior.

During my short time in New York, just by following the belief of not eating out alienated me of several chances of social interaction.

I neither wanted to be inside of a building in front of a screen or inside another building paying for something to do something. I just spent the time in the public, talking, thinking of ideas based on time in the public. And they were some of my best ideas, I felt. It was just a simple matter of thinking of design philosophy and walking around.

The law of America felt restraining too. I watched bums gets kicked out of parks. And it showed too, in the ways people acted in society. Not just refraining from doing unlawful things, but in taking several extra unnecessary actions in daily life (todo: see if i can find examples in thoughts).

I usually feel the freedom of New York only half of the time. Sometimes I feel I could takeover any abandoned building in New York and run an event there. Other times I feel pushed constrained by society to into a tiny space to make something on a computer, which leads to a huge problem.

There is no free wifi in New York. Its age is showing. I don't think modern architecture can be blamed there. Also, there aren't any outlets. One has to rely on commodity.*
--

A lot of my negative thoughts of New York are based on my visit after traveling, which is kind of unfair. Even worse, I spent quite a bit of time on Manhattan because the school is there. It was quite a suffocating experience. When I used to live in Brooklyn, things seemed much peachier.
--

From <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/i-still-dont-understand">I Still Don't Understand</a>:
<blockquote>To live in a society where one has to constantly, consciously and unconsciously, make decisions to avoid doing wrong, especially in simple daily actions such as buying food and discarding trash, to ignore indoctrination and propaganda, obvious or not, is the result of a failed society.

All nations suffer from these things. No nation is pristine; Shit is prevalent.</blockquote>
I feel there's far less of this kind of decision-making taking place in Taiwan. Less research, more doing. I find a local service person to do whatever I need to do, and it just works. My money goes to the street vendor, the healthcare shop, bike shop, or whatever. Convenient stores may be the only decision-making I remember (suck it 7-11!). There was no research of ratings or quality assurance of the places I went to. I just have faith in the people. I'm not sure if I've quite quite built that much faith in New York, especially for professional services. I only feel good in a good neighborhood, which is usually an ethnic enclave. 

I felt quite good in San Francisco too. Though, I lived in a Chinatown there. Perhaps it's just the friendly nature of the people there, of which a great amount are Asian.

<blockquote>
Yet, because less developed societies are just that, the problems are less developed too. Government may be corrupted, but people at least know what they’re eating, drinking, where their trash is going, how their dwelling was made, who their children’s teachers are, have less equality problems, and can afford and/or have free emergency healthcare. Also, with less money, there’s less chance of government committing large-scale wrongdoing such as imperialistic wars.</blockquote>

Taiwan throws out the trash themselves, know what they're eating and drinking (kind of, hah), take care of educators, have affordable healthcare.

New York suffers greatly from this. It is an entirely artificial world. People throw trash anywhere, nothing is recycled (though it's negligible compared to larger matters), there's over-consumption and over-production, teachers are underpaid and under-appreciated, and the food comes from the top food manufacturers which themselves have awful ethics. Poor ethics exist from the top to bottom.

From <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/creativity-as-organization-from-chaos" title="Creativity as Organization from Chaos">Creativity as Organization from Chaos</a>:
<blockquote>If this is the case, then it is best to live on the edge of society. Cities are the most potent area of human organization. One needs distance, surround oneself with less common materials, then create. It will also lead to a more creatively efficient lifestyle, as the mind struggle to piece together the world into new designs and idea</blockquote>

During the two times I spent in New York, I never left it. I didn't go into any kind of nature, save public parks, and that's frightening. I didn't see any farms, beaches, hills, mountains, forests, anything. A friend said he was able to camp just an hour away. So it was possible, but I didn't think of it. I was so far into nature, I just didn't think about exploring out of it on any weekend. Everything I experienced was artificial.

Taiwan has nature, bounds of it, and I actually feel it, and can quickly hike a nearby hill, or even bike to the beach.

In San Francisco, I also spent quite a bit of time biking around Golden Gate park, to the beach, and up and around some other places. Nature naturally attracts me, and if it's accessible, I spend time with it.

Taiwan feels it goes further though. I can go to other cities, towns, or farms, beautiful natural places. This is because Taiwan has a fantastic train system that goes around the country at every hour, whereas the public transportation of America is limited to the metro system and infrequent buses with no stops on the coasts.The train has a huge enabling effect. I have a friend who works on in one city and commutes to another one-quarter across the island. It was very easy for me to move to another city and work. There's a feeling that one could work anywhere on the island, save the mountains in the middle, because of it, and people do. Many people in Taipei school or work for a short period, or even commute from other cities everyday. Low-cost trains have such a strong effect that I bet if America was linked by trains, the suburbs would have died much quicker, having people move into cities.*
--

From <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/the-ideal-neighborhood" title="The Ideal Neighborhood">The Ideal Neighborhood</a>:

<blockquote>Developing countries with problems may sway one toward human rights and politics. Living in two contrasting societies can make one feel that the other is absurd.</blockquote>

Though not developing, Taiwan sometimes feels so. I don't feel much difference from Taiwan and Thailand. And I do feel much closer to people, as opposed to materials.

<blockquote>Creativity in cities can lead to furthering of aesthetics. My history clearly shows that I think of aesthetic ideas while living in a city where I consume contemporary art. Though, that may be from reacting to it. I do often think about high art in less developed places too, but it’s greatly affected by the locality, perhaps using less technology and more local materials: local craftsmen, bamboo, food carts, natural landscapes.</blockquote>

As a foreigner in Taiwan, even after living there for quite some time, I still haven't quite adapted to everything to the point I've forgotten the artificial. Also, going to the arts shop on Canal St. isn't quite the same as going to a random shop in Taipei to buy junk. I feel quite alright to cut a tree for wood, go to a mine for minerals, find metal at a scrapyard. I feel this is incredibly important for any creative profession. Materials is precisely what I feel lacks in the developed world, full of digital data. Though I'm sure people feel comfy in a workshop in Dumbo, I wasn't able to achieve such heights.

And again, this closeness to nature may have been gained because of the simple access of trains.

<blockquote>Creativity in developing countries, or any society other than one’s own, also provides another perspective, which will shape what one creates. It forces the creator to be more mindful of the audience, resulting in a more universally appreciated art, one that works in their past society and current society, fitting for structuralism. It could have elements of traditional cultures, different political systems, different amounts of wealth. I feel Ai Wei Wei exceeds because of this. He can use craftsmen in China to create a massive piece, understanding their place on a human and political scale.
</blockquote>

I think just living in two kinds of societies is enough: developed and developing. Africa might just be too mind-bending for me. Learn the aesthetics before going to the developing country.

<blockquote>Creativity in developing countries can also lead to practical applications, useful technology. In a developed country, technology seems to have passed the needs of humans. Each individual could live with 50 things or less. Living with less would increase the chance of creating something useful. If it is useful to someone with less, it is likely be useful to the rest.

Therefore, I believe creating in a developing country may be better for artists, humanists, innovators, hippies, and, perhaps, anyone of age. With the internet, it is easy to catch up current sciences and aesthetics. Being a part of a human rights community would surely lead to more practical technology. If one has time, one can continue creating high aesthetic art with a unique perspective, likely more political. Though, it may be difficult without a community, such as those that exist in cities.</blockquote>

I don't think Taiwan suffers from much human rights problems to the level of developing countries. It seems they're gotten rid of most of the bad things. But it's quite possible for me to take a very cheap flight to Indonesia for empowerment, which could be conducive to practical innovation. Though, perhaps the same could be said for Central America.
--

New York has great communities; Taiwan is a community. The recent bailout in America and protests and elections results of Taiwan proved that.

It's possible to live in a community and ignore anything higher in structure, but I think, especially of people who have the knowledge and time to worry about things on grand scale -- international affairs, politics, imperialism, etc., it's human to care for it.

If a failed government doesn't have the solidarity for successful activism, not just Ferguson, then the I think that the people of the country don't care much for their own country or of others.

To even have morals (and not confused with patriotism and "defense") is new to me. Though I attended John Stewart's march and Occupy Wall St. I didn't have much hope in it. Contrarily, <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/a-foreigner-crashes-at-the-legislative-yuans-slumber-party" title="A Foreigner Crashes at the Legislative Yuan’s Slumber Party">The Sunflower Movement</a> was a profound experience.
--

There's no better way of understanding a country than traveling around it, and any traveller will tell you that like Southeast Asia, Taiwanese people are polite, courteous, and extremely helpful.

The effects of the ethics show in the way modern society was shaped: it's clean, convenient, people are not wasteful, people are willing to spend time to talk.

Stay in a country with those ethics, and one starts to build a deep appreciation and affection for the people.

Ethics override financial factors. Besides, it's the Information Age, professional work is now location-independent.

When a country has ethics you appreciate, working, even the lowest service job, doesn't feel so bad. As a person who's had a decent salary before, I don't mind working as a street vendor, or even in a popular tea shop in Taiwan. The customers are nice. The shops are outdoors, so there's good public interaction and vision. It feels good. I don't think I would feel the same if I were to work at McDonalds.*

Perhaps the main question is, are the ethics of a country more important than a select few amazing people?

Yes. Yes it is.

And with that, I now know, Taiwan will always be my destination.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/the-life-of-a-nomadic-schizoid" title="The Life of a Nomadic Schizoid">Nomadic lifestyle</a> brings the thought of non-directional, endless possibly circular, flow. Of my personal experience, this is not true. It's more of a search for the greatest environment. I <em>tried</em> San Francisco, New York, India, countries in Southeast Asia, and cities in East Asia. The process of searching is nomadic, but that process has an end. The nomad finds a community and becomes a settler. Of my search, I found three ideal communities: <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/new-york-and-taiwan" title="New York and Taiwan">New York, Taiwan</a>, and, paradoxically, the world.
--

The greatest environment is an ideal. Isn't that why people migrate? For a better life? For the materialist, the greatest environment provides the greatest life.

Though there are many ways to live a good life, I'm quite certain it's a life that constantly evokes creativity; Any other life seems brain-dead.

What evokes creativity? <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/creativity-external-stimuli-cities-and-suburbs" title="Creativity, External Stimuli, Cities, and Suburbs">External stimuli</a>. That includes people.

Does artificial stimuli have more merit than natural stimuli? Dewey says yes, an aesthetic experience "ultimate judgment upon the quality of a civilization".

Does the ability to experience fine art through the internet remove the factor of location? No, because what one experiences through a screen is not the same as a physical experience, and one would be unable to experience it the same, less likely leading to reaction.

Is creativity just a reaction? Even when one uses a methodology, the mind combines past information to create new ideas.

Does the quality of fine art that one is often exposed to make one's creations better?

Does the lack of exposure to fine art make one more likely to create more divergent ideas?
--

Is MIT the best environment? It's probably the single community that caused the greatest positive changes in the world.

Should MIT be emulated? MIT is just a physical space with a bunch of smart people, which means only the people matter, not the space. It's not even in a real city (okay, maybe I haven't been to Boston, but come on!).

Does that mean space is not a factor? I can't believe that.

Personally, I know no better way of understanding the world than walking on this earth. No media or settled lifestyle could have evoked the thoughts I had while traveling.

Additionally, I know no better way of sparking creativity than walking on this earth. As one sits for a moment, the mind will put together the things in wonderful ways.

Perhaps this is limited to artist personalities.

There are two ways to explore, through the external world and through the minds of people.

MIT offers people. The world (including cities) offer both.

A single small community is exclusive (the reason for my apathy of college towns). The community must be inclusive. A community of communities, including public interaction -- <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/new-york-and-taiwan" title="New York and Taiwan">a city, or even a country.</a>
--

Though an inclusive best single environment, constant movement should also considered an option.

Artists move from residency to residency, gaining a better understanding of the world each move.

Are art objects enough to gain a better understanding outside one's own society? I don't think so. Even with the abundance of information and cameras, I still feel experience cannot be replace.

Are art objects enough to evoke deep thoughts from the mind? Perhaps that takes some methodology, practice, and the right social environment.

Can an institution, even of the greatest minds, replace the world? Again, no.

The greatest environment [for an adult] is in flux.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In a <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/taiwan-and-japan-active-and-passive-lifestyles" title="Taiwan and Japan: Active and Passive Lifestyles">past post I described Taiwan as active and Japan as inactive</a>:
<blockquote>An active life, that is, one is constantly making decisions before taking action. One thinks to call a friend, cook something, go to a park, embark an adventure, not because they were told to, but because one decided themselves to do so.

The narrow passive consumption of Japan is more akin to the suburbs. One consumes the media around them or computer (although the computer is a more interactive form of consumption). The only new stimuli is media (if they chose a new one) and the social experience with people of whom they already have a relationship with (if they even created new relationships outside the ones they were born into i.e. their family).

I would stereotype the two countries’ societies as so: Taiwan is the social island nation where the people are always friendly and happy; Japan is the dsytopian future where media and machines replaced human interaction.
</blockquote>

In another view, I feel that they have opposite social conceptions of community. I feel that Taiwan is a community and that Japan is a bunch of nuclear families (or, in the case of cities, single households).

In Taiwan, there are a few kinds of housing options: single without bathroom, single inclusive (suite), shared apartment, and entire apartment. The single rooms are often connected, and sometimes the people know each other, especially if it's near a school.

I imagine it's similar for Japan.

In American cities, people tend to live together in two to four bedroom apartments, or even a house.

Though Taiwan and Japan have similar housing, it feels as if there's less time spent in a Taiwanese household. The people are out, day and night. Perhaps thanks to the street culture.

In Japan, it feels more common to go home. There's even formalities of entering and exiting a home. A home feels like a really important part of their culture. They buy groceries (which are almost as expensive as a meal outside) and cook food for themselves or their household, which may contain a nuclear family (or mate). They eat at home. They have a library of media at home -- bookcases full of manga, DVDs, and games.

Because more time is spent in the household, experience becomes limited to it. Experience is constricted to the social relationships in the home, media, and now, the internet.

I've personally always been a kind of street kid. It seems that Japanese culture doesn't work for street kids. People go to a library (or cafe) to take a book home, not to read at the library. There's less communal areas, less public spaces, because there's a less need of them.

In a country of nuclear families, media increases in power as a means of communication. Contrarily, public communication, solidarity required to take mass action, decreases in chance. It's the suburbs effect. Except in the case of Japan, it includes the cities.

This thought was raised after spending a day with a nuclear family. The people only talked of food. The leisure time to think and talk about it is a privilege that no one can see. The time one could spend thinking of others (outside of the nuclear family) was thought about a few times, but never lead to action.

I always face a tension when coming into relationship: how much time should be spent on relationships, and how much should be spent on others.

I feel Japanese people spend more time on relationships, and emphasize the importance of them greatly through parenting, culture (especially rituals), and it permeates to work relationships. Being a part of society means having relationships. Being outside of society is viewed as extremely bad. In this view, bums should not be cared or helped for, because they chose to be outside of society.

Though Taiwanese people spend a lot of time on relationships, it seems there's less emphasis. One could be a part of the society without many. Outsiders are welcome. All people are cared and helped for. One could be invited to eat a meal with another social group, even a nuclear family. The outsider isn't seen as such, it's another person, another part of the community.

In this post I use Taiwan and Japan. In another view, Taiwan could represent a city and Japan the suburbs. In another, Taiwan represents traditional societies (Nepal, small towns) and Japan modern (most developed countries). <strong>I feel the vital, simple difference in society this: one is aggregate of communities, the other is a community of communities</strong>.

[todo: can extend with thoughts about living in a nuclear household compared to a larger household, care for elderly, care youth, etc.]]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Solitude and Depression</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I've written a bit about this in the past when I observed <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/lone-work-and-depression" title="Lone Work and Depression">the affects of solitary work</a>, <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/sleeping-problems" title="Sleeping Problems">my history of sleeping patterns</a>, <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/mood-swings" title="Mood Swings">life as a wave of highs and lows</a>, <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/travels-end-the-return-of-unsocial-life" title="Travels End: The Return of Unsocial Life">a specific moment in my own history going from high to low</a>.

<strong>Causes</strong>:
My personal depressions usually involve a combination of these characteristics of the material world, which affect the mind and body:

Mind:
lack of social relationships
lack of sensory input (sensory deprivation)

Body:
lack of heat
lack of sunlight

<strong>Effects</strong>:
The immediate effects are:
anxiety (usually results in finding replacements for the lack of the effects [this can be very strong during more manic times])
lucid daydreaming (sensory illusion)

The later effects are:
depression
loss of time and perception
oversleeping

<strong>Actions</strong>:
I want to elaborate on the anxiety part by describing some of my past actions. It feels so basic that the desire to bring those things lost back to equilibrium seems of animalistic instinct. I've previously taken actions to relieve all of the negative effects. The actions can be separated to two kinds: immediate and long-term. Here I will discuss the immediate kinds. The long-term actions are listed under my solutions which come later.

The cause of sensory deprivation is usually an environment that isolates sensory input: a dwelling. I usually resolve this by either finding sensory input inside the house i.e. consuming media. This seems unnatural.

I usually resolve the social time simply by talking to someone nearby, or by attending a social event. If there is no one to talk to nearby, technology can be used to communicate, but I am <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/social-life-in-proximity" title="Social Life in Proximity">reluctant to use technology to communicate to people</a> outside of the isolated environment. I'm more likely to rely on the communication of artists through art objects. Though this approach too seems unnatural

The cause of cold weather is a matter of the climate of where I live. I usually resolve this with exercise, warm clothing, warm showers, and natural electric lighting. Though this approach too seems unnatural.

[todo: long term, where to put?: One time when I was in Taipei, I took the radical action of deciding to go to India, perhaps strongly influenced by this need; It was winter, though not too cold, I did not feel great. It has also affected my choice in San Francisco above New York, and Asia above America and Europe. Temperature is such a simple bodily effect that the response is a part of homeostasis, yet the the desire is factored in such large decision-making.]

[todo: move paragraph?] <strong>Houses seem to have paradoxical social and heat influences: the house has a heater, attracting people to isolation, as opposed to pushing people outside of houses, to gather in <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/public-places" title="Public Places (and Public Spaces?)">public spaces</a></strong>.

[todo: move paragraph?] The fact I've written so much about depression and not everything else in life is because solitude causes me to talk in the form of writing, likely while experiencing depression.

<strong>It is unnatural to build an artificial environment when the ability to move to an environment that offers natural solutions is possible</strong>. We don't live in a time where travel is impossible or too expensive. I feel there is a very simple, yet strong cognitive bias here, to the point that <strong>the decision to live in the place one currently resides is now unthought of</strong>. Individuals, families, entire communities alike could move, and often do when a stimulus arises (natural disaster, no money).

<strong>Personal psychology and sociology</strong>:
from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solitude">Wikipedia:</a>
<blockquote>...some psychological conditions (such as schizophrenia and schizoid personality disorder) are strongly linked to a tendency to seek solitude. In animal experiments, solitude has been shown to cause psychosis.</blockquote>

The desire for solitude for a short period doesn't fit modern society very well. I've got a <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/my-education">long history</a> of sleeping in class and working mindlessly during these times. It's the direct cause of a lot of wasted time of my own past.

To seek solitude, yet not stay in it for too long is a common struggle anyone (especially artists that want to get personal work done). I've argued that it is <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/the-ideal-neighborhood" title="The Ideal Neighborhood">best to live in a community of a developing country</a> and even better to <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/living-on-the-edge-of-society-ethics" title="Living on the Edge of Society Ethics">live on edge of that community</a> for higher creative needs.

In addition, nearly every winter I face this problem solely due to the causation of negative effects on the body.

<strong>Solution</strong>:
To avoid solitude, I need to simply remember to avoid these places:
cold and non-sunny climate
dwellings isolated from large communities

The warm climate deters cold and lack of sunlight.
A dwelling near a large community (small towns, cities, institutions) deters isolation.

<strong>Conclusion</strong>:
Perhaps these are the reasons I have a tendency to prefer <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/nuclear-families-and-communities" title="Nuclear Families and Communities">large communities to small ones</a>. To the dismay of those individuals I've met in small communities and for the self-interest of my own health, it seems <strong>my ideal lifestyle is to live within a larger community, which allows me to go into phases of soft solitude</strong>.

This ideal lifestyle constricts my <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/the-ideal-neighborhood" title="The Ideal Neighborhood">ideal habitat</a> to a large community. Thus, the environment I live in isn't just for the sake of increasing creativity, having proximity of the intelligent and their communities, or other high-culture needs, but also for the basic needs of health, determined by very simple sensory and social factors.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Open spaces provide chaos.

Closed spaces provide organization.

The mind is an organizing machine.

Change between open and closed spaces balance chaos and organization.

Travel provides chaos.

Houses provide organization.

Cities provide flux.
--

It seems the goal of academia is to organize information into words, artists organize information into art forms, urban planners into organize materials into cities. When will we just embrace chaos and live in anarchy one day at a time?
--

Media can provide chaos too. It is up to the mind to organize it.

I've said that <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/information-organization-mediums-creativity-and-experience" title="Information Organization, Mediums, Creativity, and Experience">the more divergent the data of the unknown product, yet still maintaining an idea the better the aesthetic.</a>

I've been reading books lately, so Calvino comes to mind.

The power of poetry (or poetic prose) is in it's conciseness -- it is able to convey an idea with a few words.

A power often associated with conciseness is the ability to redirect the user to another idea. To continually do this is a kind of flux.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>The Limits of Digital Work</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Digital work has its limits, even the highest form of today's robots do. They can't emulate a teacher, a doctor, or a three-year old. For the most part, it only provides knowledge in the form of data.

It seems to me that there is a cognitive bias in developed societies whereby doing some digital work for good is significant in value, whether it's donating to a high level organization, funding a kickstarter campaign, giving data for earthquakes, or offering their own computer for protein synthesis. All of these forms of charity are very low in value.

I don't know how the capital from high level organizations reach low level ones, but it's probably through a lot of wasted effort.

I can only think at a community-level, and I don't quite understand why others don't. I believe, this is perhaps linked to the <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/the-home-fallacy-or-nomadism-is-normal" title="The Home Fallacy or: Nomadism is Normal">home fallacy</a>.

Perhaps another reason to throw everyone who lives in the suburbs of a developed country to a nearby homeless shelter, empowerment organization, or professional aid facility, or, to a developing country, and do some actual work.
--

The limits of Digital work also may lead to the discontent of people in the knowledge society. [needs more thought]]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The film was great, but the winter blues got me down, so my brain isn't firing nearly as much.

<blockquote>Morocco</blockquote>
This country is near the top of my list to go to because it retains such a strong <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/happiness-and-public-spaces" title="Happiness and Public Spaces">street culture, and therefore high happiness index</a>.

<blockquote>Farm-life</blockquote>
Agricultural society?

<blockquote>Innaritu understands multiple cultures and lifestyles, the similarities and differences in ethics. He probably traveled much in his life.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Why not celebrate together? A problem with houses.</blockquote>
Never-mind, the maid actually took the kids to Mexico. Nice!

<blockquote>Kid's don't learn from television.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Tourist shot. It's plausible. More likely to get in a car crash though, but that wouldn't have blown up in American media.</blockquote>
Framing.

<blockquote>Japanese deaf volleyball player.</blockquote>
So much to be learned from deaf people.

<blockquote>This film is fucking amazing because of the constant switching between societies.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Hah, chicken leg broken.</blockquote>
Reminds me of the time I created the belief that one must be able to kill what they eat.

<blockquote>They had fun catching chickens though.</blockquote>
There's a nice sensual pleasure in Mexico, one they were probably deprived of.

<blockquote>Oof, such ethical conundrum. The older female indegenous-appearing person stopped pressuring the wound.</blockquote>
Or maybe it was done?

<blockquote>The deaf is shunned from society. Yet wants to be a part of it; Societal norms disregards them.</blockquote>
It's so rare that I encounter deaf people. Perhaps they are less willing to come out to the public, and stick to institutions and home.

<blockquote>Societies are too distant to face emotions for(?), only real experience can give to feelings.</blockquote>
Perhaps this thought came when a television showing media appeared. <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/experience-and-action" title="Experience and Action">Media just can't compare to reality in inciting action</a>.

<blockquote>An aside: The director travelled at ages 17 and 19 via a cargo ship to work across Europe and Asia.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Only because an American died such value is given.</blockquote>
They even sent a helicopter!

<blockquote>All to go for a marriage.</blockquote>
Traditional values make people do crazy things. Even now, I have a cousin who's wedding is in India. The cost is at least the cost of displacing 20+ Indian-Americans via a round-trip flight across the world.

<blockquote>Hah, the marriage in Mexico reminds of those in Southeast Asia and India.</blockquote>
They just seem odd.

<blockquote>The scenes of the Mexican marriage and park in Japan are beautiful.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Cops shoot without care for the villagers.</blockquote>
I didn't quite understand why the cops were so angry. Do they care for Americans that much? Weren't they Moroccan?

<blockquote>The edge of civilization is near, especially as the world becomes more connected with transportation. The effects of societies clashing is inevitable.</blockquote>
It's surprising how close (in proximity) these events are. The Mexican border is perhaps 12 hours away by car, or an hour flight. One could experience a completely different society in a matter of hours. As budget airlines increase, people do. The effects of this, I am unsure.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I recently watched Jia Zhangke's trilogy on and off over the past few days. This includes 小武 (Pickpocketer), 站台 (Platform), and 任逍遙 (Unknown Pleasures). I couldn't stop myself.

I don't know of many films that explore the transformation from traditional to modernity as these do. As a person who's travelled to a few places where modernity shows it's face in products, notably, northern Laos, I felt thankful for them helping me make sense of it.

I didn't watch the films continuously. I'd watch half, stop, watch another half of anther film another day. It's all a mix in my mind.

I currently am at an all-time low, so my philosophical inquiry is equally so.

已經，只有一個片刻的看別的社會，我的頭腦開始做事。我得直看別的人。
As I said, I've been brain dead lately. Watching what other people do, how their minds work, is infinitely interesting.

他們等著公車。哇，已經感覺別的世界。
At the initial bus stop scene I already feel I'm taken to another world. A world during my travels, away from the sedentary life of a knowledge society influenced by written and video-related media.

那個公車提醒我印度，老撾，尼泊爾。
The bus reminds me of India, Laos, and Nepal. A little dirty, poor, and the people inside aren't so intelligent.

哇，這電影非常好，腳踏車的場面，扒手，不聰明人看你。
At this point I already felt the film was amazing. Perhaps it's because there are so few narrative films that take place in this setting. I was also quite glad to see a film to make sense of undeveloped societies, such as those I saw in Laos.

The people stare. It's true. It's quite uncomfortable in reality, but it's quite normal. It's similar to the way I may stare at films.

聰明的人不知道什麼做。
Smart people don't know what to do in this kind of society. There's no science, art, or technology. No hope. They either must create their own organization (grassroots) or leave.

再，法事，結婚對人做瘋狂的事。
Again, rituals such as marriages make people do irrational things.

哇，真的鄉村。跟印度的鄉村一樣。
It really felt like a rural, undeveloped society, similar to those farms I've seen in India. It's so rare to see a film take place in such a place, and furthermore, have characters that are from that place. Perhaps it's because it's difficult to have those people to act, or, it's difficult to have actors act such parts.

他真的不知道什麼做。有空，沒有創造力。
The main character really doesn't know what to do. He has free time, but just has no direction, motivation, creativity.

他沒有老師。他不知道女人怎麼做。沒有生活。
He doesn't have a teacher. He also doesn't know how to talk to girls. Too smart to communicate to normal people? He has no life, but do others?

我琢磨主任跟這個演員一樣。
The protagonist must be the director's image. Also, the town must be where the director grew up.

稱讚結婚真奇怪。
Praising the marriage of a rich person is really strange. Loyalty for a rich businessman? Why?

--
後半我沒寫。
I watched the second half at another time and I didn't write much. It was late, and I just soaked it all in.

只看，非常好的藝術。鄉下人的生活。

最後的場面真可怕的。真的可以羞恥之心。
Again, when less intelligent people stare at you, it can be quite frightening. In the last scene, shame is added. It's a strange phenomenon. If one acts in a way different from what a society expects, people are bewildered by the action. Save, perhaps, in cities, where people have gotten used to differences, and generally don't have time or care to stare.

---
<a name="Platform">站台 (Platform)</a>

導演是主角。
The protagonist is definitely the director.

他小時候看電影。給他生命，知識。
When the director was young, he watched films. It inspired him, gave him knowledge.

現代主義。人學藝術，看電影，穿時新的衣服，抽煙。消費者。也一個孩子。
The effects of modernity and consumerism are apparent here: people study art, watch films, buy new fashionable clothing, smoke (well, people did that anyway out of addiction). There's also the one-child policy. All of this is introduced to a rather undeveloped society. It's a step toward modernity from the last film, in which these influences did not exist, or, at least, it was not a focus of the film.

With modernity comes aesthetic; The desire for aesthetic leads to consumerism? -- fashion, films, smoking. Knowledge and hedonism seem associated.

It is so rare to have a film that explores the first effects of modernity. With modernity comes knowledge and consumerism. It's quite difficult to separate them.

如果有東西，當然要。
If something exists, of course people will want it. The existence of new objects gives knowledge of their existence, and with knowledge of it, people will desire. If in the Western world, or somewhere in the world, fashionable people, smart people, people with technology exist, and one learns that those things they exist, it seems natural to desire those things.

Without the knowledge of them, one lives unknowingly. Avoiding them is asceticism.

音樂機對主角真有意思。
The boom-box really interests the protagonist. He's never experienced it before. It's portable; It plays music; It's an amazing invention. Shortly after, a dance party becomes possible because of it's existence.

哈哈，看主演好玩。真聰明。住在不太聰明的地方。
Watching the protagonist act within a society of which he is much smarter is really interesting. He only reacts to new things, consuming them quickly. He does the least amount of work to survive. In one scene, he casually grabs hold of a truck for free transportation. He's in control of everything.

Only new things, knowledge is his interest. Otherwise, a simple life is enough. There isn't much consumerism in him. Just a pair of bellbottoms, and perhaps in the next film, eating at a restaurant, of which it is his mother's first time.

哇，表現了最低的階級。
It's just amazing to see a film taking place in the lowest class of society. For me, there is quite a large difference between blue collar workers in America and those people in northern Laos. The people in Laos just have a lot less things. Their house would maybe have a less than 50 items in total. There's far less stuff, and in my mind, it makes a large difference in society, no matter the social class.

除了學校就是煤礦。
The only options in the people's minds are going to school or going to the coal mine. Nothing else to life. No other way to learn. No other way to live. Society has narrowed life down to two choices.

In the first film, society urged the protagonist toward business. In the third film, the mother urged a character to join the army; That character felt he had no other choice, and just felt hopeless after he found out he was unable to join.

第二半：
真好提醒我遼國。
It really reminds me of Laos. I guess I haven't seen a film with this kind of society after going to Laos. It's all I could really compare it to.

沒有前人也知道學校比煤礦比較好。他的工作非常不好。怎麼可能聰明人許工作這麼不安全？
At least people without money (at such a low level of society) value school over the coal mine. It's always astonishing people know dangerous coal mines exist, yet are unable to do much about it, except, make art about it. How can people continue living in wealth without at least giving coal miners helmets?

嗎，爸爸不知道他的女孩子去哪裡。不可能停她。
The father doesn't know where his daughter is. An effect of modernity? Kids go about doing what they want, a generation different, unable to understand, manage, or stop them. The next generation is smarter. What can they do? The whole Tokyo Story conundrum again.

藝術家自己發現他們做什麼。在鄉下真漂亮。
Artists discover themselves. It's quite beautiful to see this in such a rural society. That even artists exist there. Their aesthetics are ancient as the the media that reached them, yet they are the most intelligent people in their society. It gives some direction. It leads to traveling to consume more art. In turn it leads to more performances, incorporating the things they learned.

哈哈，好酷，藝術人有藝術時間。他們得旅行。
Haha, there's a scene where the artists go to a shady place to experience art. It reminds me of shady art venues in American cities. It's more lovely here because of the contrasting setting. The artists depicted in this film feel no different than the most creative artists in Brooklyn. It's quite unbelievable to see it.

哇，女人跳舞對人應該看得奇怪。
The modern dances must look strange to the audience. Showing any kind of art to the general public must be similar to showing fine art to the general public of America: people don't understand nor know how to react.

This dance reminds of quite a few times during my travels when I didn't quite understand art in less developed societies. In Penang, Malaysia, I went to a restaurant, and there was a performance of a transsexual singing old pop songs. In Baroda, India, there's a school that runs old plays. All over Taiwan, there are plays, Chinese classical music, and even puppeteering, The aesthetics are ancient, non-progressive. Art departments still teach them. It was always quite an oddity to me, as a person who lived in New York and experienced current art. It's understandable for old societies, but for any society that has an internet connection, it's very a very strange experience.

他的爸爸也去城市。
His father works opened a business on the highway. He feels like an intermediary step of modernity between the protagonist and the mother. The father doesn't come home often, a characteristic of modernity. Three generations in one family.


<a name="UnknownPleasures">任逍遙 (Unknown Pleasures)</a> 
哈哈，真花哨的表現。
Hah, something looks really gaudy. That's the word that comes to mind when seeing modernism in less developed societies. Especially seen in Modernist architecture -- those tacky large museums with no actual inside of them. Those large housing projects with no humanity. Those performances done without knowing why, just mimicking another society and failing to do so. It's a really odd sight.

哇，真好。他知道怎麼現代影響人。
I'm still just amazed at how well the director portrays the influences of modernity.

本人不打定主意。
?

按摩，歌劇。
There was an opera singer singing Western songs. Perhaps the existing aesthetic of Chinese opera helped understand Eastern opera.

哇。他的媽媽說參軍。
One of the characters mother tells him to join the army. For money or for "honor"?

他住在安居工程。
One of the characters live in a housing project, or it seems.

哇，真的奇怪。看電視的房間，差不多karaoke。
There's a room where couples watch television. It's quite strange, but perhaps an early form of karaoke. I guess television is the new media of the time, more easily accessible than books, and therefore able to convey ideas to less capable people better, especially apparent in conveying aesthetics.

I think I recall in one the films, perhaps the first, that the smart character read some Marx. So, books do exist. Even in this film, the smart character asks his friend for some high-art films, finding none he wanted, but still buying one.
--

第二半：
現代主義：理智人只有看傳統人做什麼。不需要參加傳統的東西。
More influences of modernity: the smarter characters just watch more traditional people live and work, no interest in joining their traditions. This occurs in several scenes. The main character mostly just rides his motorcycle watching the world go on.

人真的笨，他們反應好慢。
The less intelligent people react so strangely, yet accurately from my experience: slowly. Though in the film it's quite strange to see actions be repeated five or more times. This occurs when hitting the main character in the club, pushing the girl down when she found out, the girl biking in circles, and some more times of which I don't quite remember. It's like watching a rat being conditioned. If one is accustomed to people in a city, these people may even seem inhuman, lacking life.

In Laos, I experienced the slowest people I've ever encountered. Everything runs on their own peaceful time. I quite enjoyed it, but there was definitely a lack of reaction whenever one desired something. It seems desire can be associated to intelligence.

在傳統的地方可以活只有短的時間。因為沒有理智人。可是如果你是聰明你得會作理智的事。
It seems rational, smarter people, can only live in such a traditional society for a short period of time. They find that they can't really engage in society, so they leave, to join other more intelligent people, and do whatever they do.

I don't know what scene provoked this thought, but in one of the scenes from Platform, there was a guy who left the troupe to go home, but came back because there was nothing to do at home, alone.

Though, I think an intelligent person can do a lot, just in a more political way. The characters from Platform were artists, so it's quite difficult to share ideas when there is a gap in the knowledge of aesthetics.

在社會外面主角看社會。只有可以看創痛的東西。
All of the modern-affected characters can do is look at traditional society.

現代人為貴。
Modern people are valued. The girl is valued because she acts modern -- she dresses with modern clothing, she sings and dances modern songs. Somehow, traditional society values that, without really understanding it. Why is modernity valued? Because it is simply different from traditional society?

二十年的錢她要用了修復房子。
After working for twenty years the mother decides to use some of the money to renovate the house. That's what a good mother in a traditional society does with money. All there is left to do is make a better house. Her notion of work is simply something that makes money, or 'honor' in the case of telling her son to go to the army. It doesn't seem to go much further than that.

Many Indians have this idea in their minds. They survive, make money, but after everything, there is little charity, or putting money back into the world, instead, they just build a large house, of which no one benefits from, not even its inhabitants.

高速公路開了門，意思是，可以互通情報。
A highway opens. In another part of the film Beijing wins the Olympic bid. More hints of modernity. Highways, at the time, were the only link to more information.
--

Looking at synopsis on Wikipedia, it becomes much easier to see actions. Here were some observations, and pieces copied from it:

Aimless people, because there is no hope in the society. No empowerment, art, or science.

One event sets the characters into action: the explosion of a textile mill.

Gift-giving is the largest use of money, even going into debt and taking a loan for. After buying a gift, the character has to sell DVDs for a few yuan each to make that money back.

Zhangzhi philosophized that we should do what feels good. Again, hedonism and materialism are associated with modernity.

Feeling of no future after getting denied by army. Joining the army was the only action to make his mother happy, and therefore him.

Learned to rob a bank from American films? Too much Quentin Tarrentino? Sadly, could have ended in death penalty.

"At first it was the bleak and lonely buildings that attracted me. When I saw the streets filled with lonely, directionless people, I became interested in them." When I travel, I normally pass by such places, uninterested. There are many failed cities the world, especially in India and China, where modernity shows its ugly side. It really does feel as if there is no hope, just people mimicking others. No creativity, poor urban planning. Cities with the value of survival when cities are supposed to represent self-expression.

'Unknown Pleasures was filmed using digital video in only nineteen days, as a result of time and budgetary constraints.'...'Jia was able to begin shooting a mere three weeks after developing the idea for the film.'

'This generation is often detached from reality, filtering their experiences through the internet, television, and other media.' It is quite an alienating experience when one grows up with media as a source of knowledge, but it's up to the person to be able to turn ideas from media into conversational language. Though, when people only have television, no people or books to talk with, these people are left detached.

"the attitudes of these kids are almost completely derived by the electronic mass media that they consume and that consumes them."

'In Unknown Pleasures, young people lack discipline. They don't have any goals for the future. They refuse all constraints. They run their own lives and act independently. But their spirit is not as free.'

For Jia, the story of the Monkey King "reflects the fatalism of [Unknown Pleasures]" in that unlike the Monkey King, these characters "struggle desperately. They pull themselves out of difficult situations, but they always fall back into new problems because no one can escape the rules of the game. True freedom doesn’t exist in this world."

'That year, reality was more theatrical than anything we could see at the movies. It even leaned toward surrealism. The entire population got worked up. This strange excitement gave me a worrisome feeling. The anger of society's inner layers was beginning to come out and show itself.'

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>"Its every judgement and every decision are the root cause of society's various calamities." - Ai Wei Wei</blockquote>

From <a href="https://civic.mit.edu/blog/erhardt/action-path-a-location-based-tool-for-civic-reflection-and-engagement" title="Action Path">an article about Action Path</a>, a tool from <a href="http://www.media.mit.edu/research/groups/civic-media" title="MIT Media Lab's Civic Media">MIT Media Lab's Civic Media</a>:
<blockquote>Taking people out of their routine spaces, and in some cases forcing them to work synchronously, represents a high barrier to entry for many would-be active citizens.</blockquote>

<blockquote>to see how cities actually work through experience, to go out and see what makes a neighborhood thrive, or to see what makes a neighborhood struggle,</blockquote>

TODO READ MORE OF THAT ARTICLE.

Good communities such as post-modern cities and traditional small towns have a pretty good balance of physical and digital data; They are in tune with the world, their neighborhoods, and their neighbors.

It would be nice to have crucial civic data to fit the physical, especially for the sake of encouraging civic engagement, specifically, urban planning. If a person's building is going to be demolished, it should be known. People physically see several things during their everyday commutes. They care for it. They should have access to the civic data that goes to it. And it shouldn't be hidden in community meetings or the digital world.

Even if a pizza shop is shutting down, the pizza shop owner might say to his fine customers, "we're shutting down because the rent was raised again"! Most people won't respond to that with action. Instead, that would shrug and say, "that's life, good luck". Similarly, the pizza owner probably wouldn't have a petition for keeping his business up. The people are the agency here. It's up to people to know that rent has gone up for the entire block at an absurd price because a big business is planning to build a headquarters nearby.

Thus far developed societies poor efforts at a creating a more interactive life have only lead to giving people mobile phones. So, it seems, for now, that an application is all we can do to give that kind of data to the people during their everyday walks.

Is that enough? Will people download an application and look at it?

Physical interaction is always more powerful than digital. Having a physical sign will lead to more action than a digital one. Only those who have time to research deeply to make a decision will resort technology for data. Otherwise, for those short decisions, a more casual talk is better.

Perhaps there just needs to be physical signs everywhere about everything going on in dense places. If a building is going to be demolished, sold, built, there should be a sign that says so, far ahead of the date. That should be the law. If it is the law, then when something abrupt happens, citizens will be able to argue that there was no such sign.

That reminds me of finding apartments in Taiwan. Though there's a ton of websites, just finding a neighborhood one likes, then looking out for a particular red sign that says for rent, a physical bulletin board, and talking to local people turned out to be a <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/the-apex-of-mania-and-creativity-in-taipei" title="The Apex of Mania and Creativity in Taipei">quite effective compared to using apartment websites</a>, especially if one cares more about the location than the amenities. Also, it's just more physical, and therefore more fun, at the cost of efficiency.

The sign could have a website on it to a digital place. Physical things should lead to digital things, rarely ever the other way around.

At least for now, we can start with that mobile application for the sake of easily geolocating places. Until Google Glass is as prevalent as mobile phones, I'm unsure of what can be done.

Design Ideas:
There should be a kind of portable electronic ballet for public civic decisions. A fingerprint, a few buttons, and maybe a camera. Place it at any location, and enable the people to vote for decisions on anything.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Materials and Media</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I almost have the conviction that although in the Information Age data and the organization of it is crucial, the materials used to interact and display are more so and more overlooked.

Looking at design and technology programs, it seems most build on the Internet of things, micro-controllers in everything, but far less into the use of new materials. Of all the materials, natural and artificial, surely there must  be an infinite amount of combinations.

MIT Media Lab (especially Tangible Media) has a mix of innovations around this, but not quite there. For example, there is a material with the ability to switch between soft and hard. New materials like this could be the foundation of another infinite amount of ideas. Another example, there's something akin to a pin-screen that a user can digitally manipulate. The actual prototype is quite mechanical, steampunk. But that's what I think is needed, redirect some innovation to those material contraptions.

We should think: What kind of material best conveys a certain kind of information. It would lead to screens being replaced by more intuitive materials. Perhaps there should be no screens at all.

How was it that all the focus has gone so far into digital information and not the way we interact? What happened to "the medium is the message?". Did people passively accept written or digital language as the best method of gaining information?

It really is the most efficient way to get information we want, though very awkward in style -- using a keyboard and mouse while looking at a screen, likely sitting down at a place near an electrical socket. People using computers to gain data is an example materialism in the Information Age. Digital materialism.

How come for many people digital materialism is more likely than physical? It's more efficient in getting what's exactly wanted, yet there's far less data than a walk in the city or in nature.

That leads to the idea that the Internet and the ability to interact with it should be available everywhere, in cities and nature. But even more so in nature.

Living in nature yet having an unlimited resource seems like the ultimate way to live.

...welp that thought digressed. Ending here for now!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It seems that in developing countries, there's a tendency to use self-expression to do good, especially in charity, when simply what's needed is actual work.

Sometimes this is good, as in innovations.

Usually it isn't, as in any charitable organization higher than the community level.

The cost in time of moving money, allocating other resources, and trying to innovate results in far less actual work.

If one has the time, forget the ideas and do some actual work. Be part of the society in aid. One should always be able to think while working.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Gaining knowledge in the suburbs leads to more frequent use of and perhaps even a reliance of media as a source of knowledge.

The suburbs relies on automobile transportation. Compared to the city where the city is accessible by public transportation, or a countryside, where one has a bicycle or scooter may be enough to get around, the suburbs blocks people from getting around easily and efficiently. 

The commute lacks experience. Entering a car, getting outside of a neighborhood, going on a highway, and just to enter another neighborhood is dull.

Therefore, to have an experience with people and the environment become less efficient.

Media becomes a more effective option. Of course, at the cost of a real experience -- observing reality and being a part of society.

Sole use of media is a less effective method of gaining knowledge than real experience.

Therefore, houses are detrimental to the efficacy of gaining knowledge.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The distance between humans determines how much one cares for them, and therefore, how much time is spent with them.

In the suburbs, people live in familial households. The inhabitants care for the family, even their materials, but not the public. Most time is allocating is allocated to family and materials.

In dense cities people live alone, with roommates, or with a family. People care for roommates, family, and, the public.

In my personal history, I have a natural tendency to live with the people I value the most, within the best community I know of at that specific time.

People (who have the privilege) have a tendency to migrate toward people with similar values.

When this idea is applied to cities, people choose neighborhoods who's inhabitants values are similar to theirs.

Though I believe cities should be left to anarchy, this tendency ruins diversity. I almost prefer that people be placed at random. What kind of place would that be?
--

Eh, well this thought just came to me while my Dad was doing a meaningless task. I just kept thinking that because one lives in a house in the suburbs, one physically does not see others much, and one doesn't think of allocating time to others.
--

This thought also is connected to the idea of the <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/the-home-fallacy-or-nomadism-is-normal" title="The Home Fallacy or: Nomadism is Normal">home fallacy</a>. Furthermore, it is a problem with society and the upper class.

<blockquote>"Decision makers are able to insulate themselves with bottled water and gated communities" - Jared Diamond</blockquote>

I'm also personally reminded of India, where the upper class live in lavish farm houses, away from society, building their own world, a few kilometers away from slums. I'm reminded of how those people immigrate to America and live in gated communities, including my own family and many of the Indian community. It is no different from feudal societies.

I am reminded of the upper classes of all societies: Nob Hill in San Francisco, West and East Sides of Manhattan, the farmhouses in India, the houses with gardens a bit north in Taipei (very mild form), the commercial mid-town-like districts of all cities.

How can they be so insular? How can they only live in their own abode, drive a car, ignoring the world, while living in such bustling cities?

It is a problem with the human mind. The mind can only make sense of and organize a limited amount of information, using simple ideas as aid. The mind adapts to the small world they have created. They cannot grasp much more. They can't handle the city, so they isolate themselves from it. Or, they are completely immoral.

It is also a problem with society, especially for Indians, where such a feudal life may be standardized, and now through media, such as Bollywood. When all of the media they consume show slavery, it becomes institutionalized.

Perhaps the culture of feudalism continues when they migrate to developed countries to own businesses: especially hospitality, which is wage labor at its most primitive form. Short-term rent for high profit. 
--

<blockquote>Equanimity, detachment, apathy, is the only way society works, where sane people observe without action." - Noam Chomsky</blockquote>

This is also linked the whole post-politics thing.

And the whole post-modern cities thing.
--

from <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/chaos-and-organization" title="Chaos and Organization">Chaos and Organization</a>:
<blockquote>Travel provides chaos.
Houses provide organization.
Cities provide flux.</blockquote>

I feel that people who have less intelligence organize more. People need to organize things to make sense of it. When a person with money with less intelligence organizes, they create a house away from the chaos. And in doing so, distance themselves away from other humans.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Tools for Organizing</title>
		<link>http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/tools-for-organizing</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[If <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/chaos-and-organization" title="Chaos and Organization">minds are constantly organizing things</a>, then the creation of tools for people to organize is necessary to enable people to organize things.

I've been listening to 8tracks recently, and am just amazed at the work that people do to organize songs into playlists. No machine (Pandora, etc.) can compete. <a href="http://8tracks.com/hardlyanywhere">This guy</a> created 52 playlists of amazing, esoteric (to me) songs. People take songs from free online sources, and put them into playlists.

I often search by country to hear music around the world -- folk, mix, whatever. One can really get a sense of the country by just the music. If the country is more rational-secular such as northern European countries it's likely more media-influenced, where rock and electronic music prevail. If the country is more traditional and less developed tribal music will appear. Listen to African music for drums, dance, and those Mali hits. Listen to Morocco and one gets Arab and classical influences. Listen to Algiers and one gets Arab influences in French lanugage. Listen to Hong Kong for some old Cantopop. Listen to Taiwan for some old Mandopop. Listen to Antarctica, and one gets what someone feels what Antarctica sounds like.

All of this was created because a tool was created that enabled people to organize.

What organizing tools could be created to do good? I think I mentioned before about some earthquake reporting tool. Anything could be logged with a geolocation. But there needs to be an incentive. <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/creativity-as-organization-from-chaos" title="Creativity as Organization from Chaos">The process of organizing should feel creative</a>.

Instead of playing some silly smartphone game, what if people were using that time to organize something toward something good, and felt good doing it?

<a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/experience-and-action" title="Experience and Action">In order for people to take action, one needs to have physical interaction with that thing</a>. <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/decision-making-civics-and-technology" title="Decision-making, Civics, and Technology">Civic engagement is a physical interaction</a>, and one way of doing good. But how does one constantly think of the world's poorest nations if one doesn't interact with them?

Media?

Chomsky doesn't even know the answer to this. He didn't watch the film based on his book Manufacturing Consent, but he knew the film didn't work because after watching it, people asked him "how can I help?", as opposed to taking action to do things, such as organize activist events.

One film is not enough. It needs to be a daily interaction. A new poster of a starving child one passes by everyday. A relationship with a human.

Back to tools. Before settling down to write a bunch of my ideas, I chose between a blog and a Wikipedia as my tool for organizing my ideas. Now that I'm a bit more idle, lost of passion, to pass time, I'll use it to organize more thoughts, without really taking an action toward something.

The great thing about technology is that it can affect something somewhere else. The problem is that <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/the-limits-of-digital-work" title="The Limits of Digital Work">it's limited to data</a>. 

The aim of an do-good organizing tool is to satisfy those with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Values_Survey">self-expression values</a> with creativity whose product then results satisfying those with survival values.

If survival means, getting water, food, shelter, education, medicine, bug nets, and security, can doing something digital help? [todo: worth thinking of ideas for] It seems a better use of time simply communicating. Remote education. Remote consultation. Perhaps each person from a developed country should spend one hour per day talking to a person in a poor country.

Back to tools again. Music is one. What about films? Does that make sense? If people were given a tool to take snippets of videos from free video sources, would people make video playlists? Could some be educational? [pretty good idea*]

Earlier, I was thinking about why Wikipedia is limited to words. Could people organize it into <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mapping">maps</a>? Is there a standard for mapping? Concepts are much easier to digest through diagrams than words. [this is huge*, maybe]

Some Wikipedia articles do have hierarchies of categorized knowledge, animated GIFs, graphs, and other diagrams. But can't a certain set of words be turned into maps programmatically?

Can this Wikipedia article of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyriarchy">Kyriarchy</a> be converted to a map? It's just points, lines, and arrows. Can all <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatise">treatises</a> be mapped?

I should come back to tools in the future, again and again.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Mapping Grammar</title>
		<link>http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/mapping-grammar</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Can grammar be mapped?

Can grammar be mapped to automatons (i.e. state machines)?

Can it be done programmatically?

According to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_grammar">formal grammar Wikipedia article</a>, it should be possible to at least map it to automatons.

[todo: find source for possibility of create mapping program]

Then why are we still reading words? Shouldn't we be able to see state machines on Wikipedia?

Instead of reading a 300 page book, in front of that book should be the ideas in the form of a state machine. When people read, I believe people consciencely or unconsciencely organize ideas into similar mental structures, often etching them on the sides of books.

The Prince by Machiavelli has a pretty good struture (don't read it; it's ancient), similar to treatises. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Prince">Wikipedia article on it</a> consolidates it further, but it's still an eyesore. Each chapter or pair of chapters are cut down to a sentence to a few paragraphs.

Let's take a sample paragraph form The Prince:
"...if such a prince of ordinary ability, he will always maintain his state, unless some extraordinary and inordinate force deprive him of it; and although it may be taken away from him, he will regain it with the slightest mistake of the usurper."

What does a paragraph from The Prince look like as a state machine?

hereditary princedom (state 1) -- prince causes extraordinary force -> revolution and new prince (state 2) -- usurper causes slightest mistake -> go to state 1
[todo: take picture of diagram on paper]

Because Machiavelli's view is so simple, this idea turns out to be a simple sequence of cause and events; Causality. Causality can be easily mapped. This is much easier to consume, understand, and most importantly, actively think about, to argue against. All Wikipedia articles that are instances of causality should be mapped to a flow chart.

More complex ideas will require more complex diagrams. But even those should be possible to map. 

Some ideas are a set of rules. For example ethical treatises. Sets of rules are a program, and a game. One should be able to input data into these and get output.

[todo: try more examples].

The goal of philologists should be to create a program that can read all texts and translate them into readable diagrams (though, since the translating has been done, maybe those translations will parse better).

Once a program is created, it can be used to create diagrams for each Wikipedia article.

When the ideas become mapped, they then have a language that computers can understand, and can be used to combine them with other ideas. When all of the ideas of the world are combined, a meta-view of the world is created, and thus, the greatest view of the world, including the nature of humans in it.

todo:
read more http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_grammar
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_mapping
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automata_theory
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine

Unnecessary babbling. Do not read further.
How this came about:
These questions come from my loathing of books. I have <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/my-education" title="My Education">a personal history of progressive education</a> which does not involve books. Real experience, films, history, and biographies with Wikipedia by my side is my method of learning. So when it came to a point where I incarcerated myself in my parent's house, I tried reading a bunch of books, which started out as fun, but I could not handle reading someone else's ideas. It didn't provoke thought. I found it difficult to argue with words Without constant experience, consuming media loses value.

[todo: It seems there are two kinds of media - history and idea.]

The ideas behind books can be, and are, cut down to a small Wikipedia article. People spends years, write a book, and the only thing that matters is that small idea. It doesn't really matter how they got to that idea, and I don't particularly care. It's more of a matter of seeing if an idea matches with my worldview.

To see if an idea, or even an entire worldview I quickly became attracted to the form of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatise">treatise</a>. Books that start with a preposition build upon that. Notable examples were Wittgenstein's Tractacus and Liebniz's Monadology (don't read those books; Only their structure matters). Nothing else quite made sense, especially those related to social sciences.

When I read Chomsky's Understanding Power and The Life and Death of Great American Cities, I want to see state machines. Nodes and paths... [todo: dozed off]]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[A somewhat continuation of The Power of Public Transportation.

Though transportation is most important, people still need to feel they can get around each town, even indigenous village, with some convenience.

Hiking stops:
For those less developed regions, I think it would be fun to build something between a hostel and a gazebo, so both native people and travelers can take rest. The exterior of the building should be similar to a gazebo, with an open view, but have an area that is blocked from weather to sleep in. The interior should contain minimal bedding (including mosquito net), clean water, a washing bin, a rice cooker, rice, and a first-aid kit. If the path is only accessible by hiking, than it should be at the distance of a half-day's hike. If the path is accessible by road

Each building is a new architecture project, a new design, influenced by the environment, and the designer.
--

Roads and towns are probably often created because a commodity existed there in some time in the past. Or the location was good for trading. Or perhaps just a bunch of people pushed somewhere and left to settle. Or in modern times, the city is planned for science.

In the knowledge society, this matter less. But even knowledge societies depend on the commodities that become manufactured from other countries.

Not sure where this was going...
--

from a paper:
Encouraging communal life by creating n accessible transportation and sleeping system.

Is the current train and metro system enough? Are scooters enough? People can sleep at railway stations with little hassle. People can also sleep nearly anywhere outside, though mosquitos will come.

Tainan's bus system is infrequent. Taipei's is great.

Does it benefit to have access inland? That will develop naturally as more resource points are needed.

What about building places to sleep? Are the hostels enough? Should they reach further toward nature? What can be benefitted from access to nature? Is there more science to  be conducted closer to nature? More chaos? What is there in mountains, trees, rivers, and the countryside? Leisure? Hippie life -- natural foods, natural entertainment, simple lifestyle.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[If one has a job and works 8 hours per day in the same location, then to gain knowledge modestly either requires one to use local transportation to experience things, i.e. city, or use media.

To gain more knowledge, one could get a job that changes location and people. Or, change jobs frequently, i.e. contracts.

When one creates media, one thinks about how to get the audience to gain an understanding of the world.

I think in this way, Humans of New York is quite successful. People see via photo, and understand a bit of reality through text. Of course, the location is limited to New York, and even then, limited to a rich part of it.

During more active times, I felt the only way I was gaining real information of the world was by searching videos of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIeTp7i1wqRZYiPoNXN2XHg">people</a> who would walk the streets of different parts of the world. Films are fictional. Documentaries are framed. Just taking video of the streets gives a real sense of what exists materially, and the human nature that reacts to it. To have an array of 8 monitors playing this, like <a href="http://staplecrops.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/veidt.jpg">Veidt</a> does, may be the most efficient method of consumption of media. Words surely being the worst.

HONY is a good start. Perhaps it could have a 10 second 360 degree shot to gain an understanding of the area.

Perhaps very soon, people will have small cameras recording everything all of the time. Then people could watch a random set of several lives simultaneously. Would a person be able to make sense of it? Act on it? The lives one watches would have to be near to act on it.

[todo: think more]]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Still in a poo poo mood. Didn't take much notes, or thought.

After going to a friend's house, slurring my mind out, we found a shared interest of times where human nature takes an esoteric path via passion. The next day I happened to watch Grizzly Man.

Things written while watching Grizzly Man (quotes are Herzog's):
"Natural tendency toward chaos, order in the Grizzly People foundation."

jaded view of the public

animal ethics

excited that poop came out of a live bear, even grasping it
  - Mania, though philosophic.

"Nature is not harmony, but chaos, hostility, and violence"

Timothy only used little order: moving rocks to create a trail for the bear (or fish?). He left it up to nature. At one time, metaphysics.
  - He did not bring water or food for the bears. That's what zoo's do.

Though out of sequence, Herzog's scenes of Timothy can be organized into one according to causation:
birth -> teddy bear -> squirrel and other animals when young -> farm -> prime rib restaurant -> justice via animal ethics -> watch criminal court hearing -> kodiak island during summers -> kodiak island after summer, avoiding civilization -> death


Thoughts while writing this blog post:
I haven't seen a documentary in some time, and I found the narration adding a very interesting second layer. It felt like watching a film with a person who wrote a book on it.

To use the words of ideas: nature, order, chaos, an human nature, is odd in a visual medium. Herzog makes sense of what's going on for us. If he had not narrated though, or asked the actors to be in it, the cuts of the footage may have been more comical, less solemn, yet, I believe, better, because the audience would have been able to make that judgement. Instead we hear the judgements of other's including Herzog's. Though, this may be because I very much dislike books, and enjoy the process of observing and thinking.


A comparison to Subtropical Solitude:
Another film I saw recently was <a href="http://www.vice.com/video/subtropical-solitude-123">Vice's Subtropical Solitude</a>. There a man abandon's civilization to live on an island.

Masafumi lives to nature's accord, scheduling his routine around it. Missing one task could damage his survival.

Like Timothy, Masafumi did not like civilization, perhaps also for the same reason: it damages the environment, including animals. Though, Masafumi seemed quite sociable to the documentarian. I believe Timothy is also quite sociable, in a manic manner, and only with the right people, as shown when teaching children.

Masafumi lived with a bare minimal amount, his ribcage equally bare. Timothy seemed much more healthier, though, in his last footage, he said he lost 20 pounds over the summer. Timothy hibernates; Masafumi does not.

Masafumi seems in harmony with nature, and disinterested in civilization. Timothy is also in harmony with nature, well, usually, but is is interested in society. This is his greatest difference between him and Timothy. Though Timothy despises society, he still acknowledges it. He wants to make a change. He created a foundation to do so. It is his passion. The creativity required to get close to the bears, and filming it all. Masafumi's ascetic nature appears stale compared to Timothy's passionate nature. Masafumi is merely surviving, living according to his ethics. Timothy acts according to his ethics too, but in addition he tries to shape reality according to it.

[todo: comparison to me. helping society, is it possible to help, etc.]]]></content:encoded>

		<title>The Limits of my Language</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>"The limits of my language mean the limits of my world...The subject does not belong to the world, but it is a limit of the world...About what one cannot speak, one must remain silent" - Wittgenstein</blockquote>

Related Wikipedia article: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_determinism">Linguistic Determinism</a>.

After much travel, and when trying to write, I found it near impossible to write what I understood of the world because my linguistic ability was primitive. But <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/no-more-writing">I believe thought comes before language</a>.

And when reading other's writings, I feel the same way. There is too much lost in communication.

Historians go back in time discovering people who had first thought of a certain idea, in their language, in their words of the time, in their art. People understand a lot. It's just never written down clearly. The idea of linguistic determinism surely started before Wittgenstein, but there just happens to be a lot of research on him, and therefore his name appears first on the Wikipedia article. Perhaps someone thought it before Aristotle. Some mute person.

Humans are time-limited machines. We are currently better than machines at organizing data.
--

When I think of New York City. I think of an infinite amount of information that I actually have, of ethnic enclaves, buildings, waterways, shops, streets, people, interactions, technology, places of art, places of education, districts, and so on.

Just walking through it is enough.

I think about how I could live in Sunset Park, a Chinatown. How Chinatowns are developed autonomously by Chinese immigrants. How hipsters use the low cost of living to start businesses and studios on a nearby street. How the Chinese parents came here to provide an education for their children. Their children enjoying the knowledge of New York, while satisfied with the simple pleasure of eating Korean fried chicken.

I think about the millions of useless jobs, especially related to government (and those that Veblen said: religion, sports, education). How that money is paid by imperialistic wars.

I think about the millions of immigrants working long hours at restaurants and lower paid jobs to merely pay for rent, the concept of which seems feudal.

I watch a homeless Asian lady live off of the plastic bottles she snatches from trash cans [for non-recycables], and think of the culture that built such a humble nature. Her belongings in her cart. Her routes determined by experience. Her home under the bridge with the rest.

Hipsters in Williamsburg create commercial works for companies for big money, and to feed their creativity. The Financial district, a ghost town except during lunch.

The Orthodox Jews and their families between Williamsburg and Bedford. Very familial, traditional. Their synagogue reminds me of my childhood temple.

The artists that know all of this, trying to better society, but  can only react to all this external stimuli by making art outside of the institutions, and for the most part, the city.

This is only a bit of what I think of now, being away for five months. A page can't describe a city. I think of a lot more once I'm in it. Yet even when I'm in it, it's still impossible to describe it.

To describe New York, one would need to understand all of the people in it, their cultures and history, the history of the city itself, the government, American culture, all up to its current state.

Some people organize the knowledge into small subjects. Some people make art that reflects it, which allows other people to gain knowledge from it.

Jane Jacobs wrote some urban planning ideas about her experience in New York. But even to write ideas about urban planning, one must know of the people in it, and their cultures, and their traditional ways of living.

All we can do is observe, gain a bit more knowledge, and act upon it, or not.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I've been having a recurring daydream in the suburbs of getting in a car crash. I should really get of this place...

If people generally <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Values_Survey">tend to go from survival to self-expression values</a>, matching the notion of tending to self-organize toward more specific interests, then there is a loss of survival values.

I the TV show Connections, our dependence on the history of science and technology is clearly shown.

What I feel at loss are some of those primitive survival values. When a car crashes another, the people watch without knowledge of what to do, save, call for someone with specific knowledge.

I propose everyone should be taught more than CPR in their health and physical education classes. They should be taught how to heal a wound, administer a shot, find clean water, cook grains, find a shelter, swim, make fire.

Even in the developed world, I think these matter. One does not need to wait for an apocalypse. Cars crash. Planes crash. Bikers get car doored. Travel plans could blunder. Machines sever limbs. People become emotional and cause damage. People think of it less in the developed world, and in doing so, forget to emphasize the importance of learning these skills.

When I am in a developing country, there is a feeling of safety that the mass amount of people around me will take care of me if something happens. When I am in a developed country, I fear they will stare or move on with their busy lives.

Perhaps this is another personal step to a more communal life. Self-recovery is a characteristic of autonomous societies.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>DIY Ethics in Developing Countries</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[From <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/new-york-and-taiwan" title="New York and Taiwan">New York and Taiwan</a>:

<blockquote>Creativity in developing countries can also lead to practical applications, useful technology. In a developed country, technology seems to have passed the needs of humans. Each individual could live with 50 things or less. Living with less would increase the chance of creating something useful. If it is useful to someone with less, it is likely be useful to the rest.

Therefore, I believe creating in a developing country may be better for artists, humanists, innovators, hippies, and, perhaps, anyone of age. With the internet, it is easy to catch up current sciences and aesthetics. Being a part of a human rights community would surely lead to more practical technology. If one has time, one can continue creating high aesthetic art with a unique perspective, likely more political. Though, it may be difficult without a community, such as those that exist in cities.</blockquote>

I don't think Taiwan suffers from much human rights problems to the level of developing countries. It seems they're gotten rid of most of the bad things. But it's quite possible for me to take a very cheap flight to Indonesia for empowerment, which could be conducive to practical innovation. Though, perhaps the same could be said for Central America.
--

From a paper:
Can create in nature, using current knowledge and technology.

Starting from nothing, bottom-up, help communities beginning at the lowest level, going toward higher rungs of society. One could ask for money from government for civil projects.

The only requirements are cheap food -- rice and vegetables -- electricity, internet, and DIY tools to build new architecture, gadgets (design and technology), etc.

Though in the beginning, in nature, this life may be perceived as ascetic, technology allows one to affect society, even generate wealth.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[A thought from a paper:
Shouldn't one be in the place where the largest decisions that affect the world are? The cities? Where post-politics exist?

New York? You could build a protest against imperial wars on several countries, or just block wall st., and destroy the global market.

Post-politics exist in small communities too -- artist colonies, shared dwellings, rural communities, small towns. Is that enough?

It's enough for the community; It's self-sufficient. What about the rest of the world?

Is a larger community better than a smaller one?

It's more diverse, has more materials, has more population density.

Diversity combines disciplines, leading to more creativity.

Materials contribute to creativity, knowledge of material and through material. Need to learn to manage material consumption and personal creativity.

More population density means more people. More people affect more people, in a utilitarian way. Need to learn to manage social relationships. Need to excite new projects? Only social projects excite me. More active, social, language learning, pleasure, happiness. More management of people. Urban planning and community involvement. From small neighborhood to the entire city.

More people, more fun, more experience, more knowledge of people (human nature, history, culture, etc.), more creativity, more with similar knowledge to create specific communities, more knowledge of media, more knowledge of technology.

More things means a more chaotic development. More likely to distract, and lead to art. Conversely, likely to work quickly toward more immanent problems, without over-planning, resulting small positive steps. Social art make people aware, and react socially. Politics?

A large community can support people in more specific ways, allocating the work to others in a community, as opposed to relying on the limited few within.

Should large communities exist? [todo]

It seems a more ascetic lifestyle would lead to more rational, science, at the cost of detachment, leading to societal problems.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Rationality and irrationality are associated with slow decision-making and fast decision-making respectively.

Slow decision-making is strategic, like a military officer in an office with a map of the world, all of the battles pinned on it.

Fast decision-making is leads to the fastest action, and therefore is far more creative. Creative in the sense that more thoughts are created, and the ratio of them being acted is high. There is no "think before you speak", just do it.

The balance of the two is the most important skill in life.

For one can be indebted to a single job for eternity before a causal agent shifts the human. Or one could travel manically until one dies from making an error in decision on something that affects survival, such as eating the wrong plant.

Too slow and it becomes possible to create apathetic suburbs in countries too large to have a sense of community.

Too fast and it becomes possible to create cities to dense, too much stimuli, that one become addicted to the stimulus, and is unable to spend the time to partake on a large project, read a book, or listen to anyone else.

Slow decision-making is needed for the rigors of science.

Fast decision-making is needed for the charitable works toward humanity.

Slow occurs in high-level academia.

Fast occurs in ground-level organizations.

Therefore,

Slow is theoretical.

Fast is practical.

Are big ideas necessary?

Knowledge has certainly progressed since savage times.

Who's to blame, the brain or the hands?

Doing one without the other is the problem.

Revering one and not the other is another problem.

Every organization needs brains and hands of equal status.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Talking is a creative action based on a <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/the-speed-of-decision-making" title="The Speed of Decision-making">decision</a>. The brain pieces grammar together with words that contain ideas.

Oral culture is therefore more creative, because one is talking more and reading less. People speak books.

The life of a person in a society with oral culture is far more creative than the life of a person in a society affected by writing.

The oral person has less dogmatic knowledge, more empirical knowledge.
--

When a society has an oral culture, propaganda cannot exist.
--

How do judicial systems work? Are juries the law? That's a problem, but it seems paper laws made more problems, or are ignored and not enforced altogether in the case of the US.
--

Should education be conducted completely orally? Meaning, the teachers do not refer to texts.

Every class would be unique.

Without a foundation, would there be a problem with solidarity and nationalism?

I don't think so.

It should always be up to the person to create a unique path of experience, then be able to communicate one's experience to relate to another.

From <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orality">the Wikipedia article on Orality</a>:
<blockquote>In oral cultures, concepts are used in a way that minimizes abstraction, focusing to the greatest extent possible on objects and situations directly known by the speaker.</blockquote>

[todo: requires way more thought. This is interesting though! Slowly getting to the laziness of written cultures.]]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[[todo: lots of old ideas came up here, that may be worth creating a post for, or maybe not, because they are old]

Notes taken during viewing and my current thoughts while going over them:

"The examined life is not worth living."

great intro

Cornell West:
beam toward death

philosophy is critical of these things:
domination in institution
democracy is elites that are accountable for most people
of powers, which are not accountable to people
  - ?, notes are quite unreadable

Current thoughts:
I like the guy because he speaks a common language and lives in New York, but everything he said was obvious.

Well, one interesting thing is "domination in the institution". I don't remember what he said, but the idea that all institutions are coercive, having a force. Chomsky and Assange say this too. Veblen finds the point where in the process of the development of society where force is first displayed: when the men of the amiable societies begin to war. That single force effects all of society. Forever! Well, until society learns to become amiable again. Naturally toward post-politics. Or some large-scale disaster.

But that's hard when the rich are accustomed to be comfortably rich. And that the world has already been materially stratified, with slums to skyscrapers.

Maybe the problem is comfort. Travelers travel the world as if it were the apocalypse. The world is equally comfortable. The comfortably rich need to be shaken. If Katrina hit mid-town and Silicon Valley, maybe people would have woke up.

Avital Ronell:
This lady read way too much philosophy.

chaos
"the other" - can never understand others, so should not violate with my sense of understanding, let it live.
should always feel ethically, one does not do enough, never content

current thoughts:
The two points again is a kind of post-politics, autonomous society, where everyone is respected and appreciated.

The second point is nice to hear, and confirm, as I am never content, and try to never compromise. Is contentment synonymous to comfortable? Interestingly, she appeared quite content in her walk around the park.

Peter Singer:
developed city
  - ethical issue of just living there. People should see moral problems.
  - money, consumption, saving poverty (with money) 
  - "obligation to help people in starvation"
  - can't justify eating meat
  - think of what to choose from another's position
  - neglecting not using money

current thoughts:
More obvious ideas.

I absolutely agree with the ethical issue of just living in a developed country. It's probably why I watched so many foreign films when I was younger. Constant reminder is needed to keep life in check.

His resolution is naiive and possibly detrimental.

To think from another's position, people have to live in a less developed society. After a certain time, people won't choose to. Then they have to be forced to.

Kwame Appiwe:
think between evolve to globalization
  - we are good at face-to-face stuff, family, few people, can we figure  out how to be responsible to everyone?
  - problem of globalizing cultures
  - recognizing other's moral values is having a moral nature
  - not just responsible for zoo people (don't quite remember what "zoo people" is)
  - cosmopolitanism - can't retreat to a few people and base moral on them, but also can't abandon them, either learn to do both (or not?)

current thoughts:
Again, the question of politics vs post-politics, but phrased interestingly. [todo: think more]

The third point just boils down to appreciation, no forcing one's values to another. This runs into the second point, that when the world globalizes, cultures face each other, and this is where complex interactions occur. Like when a person in a bamboo hut is introduced to modern technology, and media. Things in New York seem fine though. People sort themselves out with ethnic enclaves, or mold in hipper areas.

Cosmopolitanism is probably what every second generation child goes through with their parents, a la the film Tokyo Story, or just what every artist goes through when they move to a city. It fits my ethic of leaving traditional societies alone. But when the society to be left alone is wasteful, this poses another problem.

Martha Nussbam
foundation in Aristotle's theory of justice
  - job of good political arrangement
  - to provide each person with what they need to become capable to live a flourishing human life; Supporting human capability.

social contract
  - think about people with disabilities
  - people get together out of love to create the world as good as it can be.

current thoughts:
Again, utopian post-politics. It's a nice reoccurring confirmation. I really disliked this lady. Stereotype professor, no novel ideas at all. Her basic ideas are found in the most ancient of books. Not based on experience at all.

I agree, everyone should be provided the tools to do the best they are capable of. Someone said, perhaps Singer, that instead of thinking it as another person dying, think of it as lost talent, innovation.

The helping disabilities bit fits well with the first point: to make all people as capable as possible.

The third point is social construction based on utopia, which I agree with.

Cornell West pt. II:
Hah, I think I just like him because he's conversational.

lover of wisdom
not school
courage
to philosophize is to die
truth as way of life

reality
listen to artists too
  - aesthetic pleasure
*socially isolated yet more alive than the people on the streets

current thoughts:
I'm guessing the interviewer asked what a philosopher is.

"to philosophize is to die" is a phrase that comes to my mind too. It's a social death. "socially isolated yet more alive than the people on the streets" was nice to hear while being filmed on the streets.

'Listening to artists' is something I didn't realize 'til quite late in life. Probably because I didn't socially die 'til a late time in life. I was the artist. I kept an eye on the forms and aesthetic of others, but didn't see it as a way of something that people create as an action in life during a certain point in time and place.

Michael Hardt:
Democracy is rule of all by all
  - age 20s in the 1980's went to Latin America to see revolutions, politics, all he felt he could do was observe*
  - better to revolt in the U.S.
    - would U.S. lose or gain?
  - Go to ??? and start an armed cell. Practically did not know how. Guns, etc.? Don't know how to conduct a revolution.

current thoughts:
More post-politics.

The first point sounds like me in Taiwan.

The second point is really good. It's better to revolt in the U.S. because it affects the rest of the world so much. [todo: lose or gain?]

After coming back from travel to the U.S., I had to make sense of the world. The idea of having such a guerilla-style revolution doesn't seem right in a developed country because it contradicts it so much. Whereas if one were closer to nature, on a farm, it feels more possible. It's a problem of adaptation. It's like creating a very weird art that no one understands. The problem isn't the idea, it's that it deviates so far from current societal norms, and that makes it more difficult to make reality of.

Zizek:
My favorite. He's also quite popular, not complex, but at least his ideas are based on cognitive biases ("wired to act", which leads to poor decision-making, especially in developed societies. It also feels that he's got some experience traveling. Thus far, it seems all of the others are Americans that haven't been outside of it. Zizek has the philosopher-traveler feel. A bearded friend on an old couch constantly disgusted at the world, and directly interacts with the world. Perhaps the least academic found in this film.

Problem with world. We don't see everything, i.e. trash, (or people dying).

temptation for meaning
  - natural to interpret to make something simple; but really it just happens

the existing world is the best possible world

against science?

alienated from natural environment

Know, but not act upon it. Should visit sites of catastrophe.* It's unimaginable we are not wired to act on it. Should learn to love the artificial, love trash, oil, animals, etc.

current thought:
The first thought is the core of all social problems. Related to <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/the-distance-between-humans" title="The Distance between Humans">the distance between humans</a>, it is a basic cognitive bias. Humans will take bad actions, even if they have the knowledge of it [todo: link zizek review, known knowns etc.]. [todo: requires a lot more thought]

Finally a little cognitive science. Indeed the brain tries to abstract detail into digestible ideas. [todo: think more]

This is the first time I've heard the third idea. This is very interesting to think about at any point of time, in history, present, and future. That humans overall try to create the best societies and altogether, the best world, and this is what has come so far. [todo: think more]

He's against science? Did Zizek fail to notice the history of science (and technology) and how it affects the world? Or does he blame the hierarchy required to upkeep it?

I agree with being alienated from the natural environment. The suburbs is the opposite of nature, and this idea is the only reason I can think of people are able to live between house, office, and Walmart.

I agree with the catastrophe bit. People need to directly experience things to orient their mind correctly.

People should love trash, oil, animals, and the natural resources which are naturally dirty. Perhaps it is the adaptation of comfort when people being to fear "getting dirty"

Judith Butler:
Don't think about ???
  - SF is accessible, public transportation, curve cuts, buildings -> social acceptability*
  - social repression of people: aversion to others, limited housing, carer(?), socially isolated*
  - did not feel she could get coffee
  - help is something we all need, though we look down upon it*
  - what can a body do?
  - where is the backlog(?) of human?
  - human as site of interdependency
  - want to organize the world based on all those things

current thoughts:
I really like that they are walking and rolling (I'm scientific) around San Francisco. Always good to think about urban planning for all people. This lead to my own ideas of <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/urban-planning-for-solidarity" title="Urban Planning for Solidarity">how the material world can socially isolate or bring people together</a>.

Far better than whoever that last lady was. Social repression is a huge problem often neglected. Not in the simple feminism, black people stuff, but the more seemingly slighter forms of neglect: being averse to others. To think that all of the blind and deaf people are in deaf and blind schools and probably rarely go far from it because they are socially isolated. I wish they pervaded society. San Francisco probably is the place where I encountered the largest range of people: several forms of disabilities, disabled veterans, bums in the tenderloin, along with the hippies, yuppies, and in-betweens. It's indeed quite a refreshing place to be. New York can sometimes be ruthless in comparison.

"help is something we all need, though we look down upon it". This is so true, and a core characteristic of community.

Lastly, again, confirming the social construction based on one's utopia.

Cornell West pt. III:
Hi again! :)

Romanticism
  - is harmony possible? Beethoven learned to look at darkness and still have it.
  - Blues starts with not caring for harmony, ride on dissonance.
  - Time is lost on romanticism, keep fairing(?), play, the experience, never reach meaning, die without meaning

current thoughts:
Philosophers' aesthetic taste is as old as they are. None of them have seemed to experience modern forms of art.

I like the third idea. To just keep playing, progressively learning, in constant search for meaning, dying without ever finding it. This constant love for wisdom but inability to be content.


Overall:
I think the film did well in it taking place in developed societies, to show the contrast of the philosopher's ideal society and the world they live in.

I think all of the philosophers fail in bringing any complex (in art, science, or logic) or novel ideas up, including solutions, which is also where the film excels -- I wish 10 minutes were give to every smart person so that one could easily gauge other's creativity.

The film also works because all of their ideas point toward post-politics, autonomy, and so on. The problem is that not a single one gave a solution. They didn't say, displace the entire middle class of developed societies, trade office employees with people from developing countries, remove superfluous jobs in developed countries, assassinate business magnates and distribute the wealth, stop buying products, sit on the streets, disrupt society. And that's probably what differentiates academic philosophers and artists or revolutionaries. They don't even say, innovate, use science and technology to consume less and spread more knowledge. Philosophy is a temporary phase. Perhaps pop academic philosophers have a place, like Jon Stewart has his, but it shouldn't be honored. Academic philosophers are oxymorons. They say that the ideal is a community, but they aren't a part of it. These people are unimportant. Likable, but unimportant, in that, they have nothing novel to say, and more importantly, do.]]></content:encoded>
