### the mind of ra the wolf
a digital form of of my philosophies: my mind. It started as a blog which was a sorta philosophical diary intended for the public, that i started when i was 15

i have philosopher personality, and sometimes i express myself through writing, creating a life-llng philosophical diary.

i have my own unique thoughts, ideas, concepts. Those concepts build up to make my own language, or at least patterns ( a 'pattern language'?) Anyway, it's worth keeping my own view of the world in tact.

- check this commit for when i replaced the exported files [remove toc](https://github.com/rahil627/mind-of-rathewolf/commit/dd4f9e13cba174a94e385ee18b71bb5bb83cf886)
- currently: the posts and drafts come from jekyll export dated 11-01-2022, but, i don't think it exported pages...? re-check this. i think the current pages come from the older jekyll export (2020?)
  - eh, i trashed that older jekyll import... oops?
- it's starts by porting my old blog (Wordpress!!! lolll... yiikes!!




- this is one repo that should have an appropriate license...
- add The Mind of Ra crowd-funding writings
- re-directs: mindof, themindof, blog, philosophy, philo
- make this repo private, but be warned: you cannot use GitHub Pages on a private repo

temp:
should use Wordpress to backup to an xml file first

https://import.jekyllrb.com/docs/wordpress/
  - official importers
  - https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-import

https://talk.hyvor.com/blog/migrate-from-wordpress-to-jekyll/
  - uses an outdated plugin, but not bad
