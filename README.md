### the mind of ra the wolf
a digital form of of my philosophies: my mind. It started as a blog which was a sorta philosophical diary intended for the public, that i started when i was 15

i have philosopher personality, and sometimes i express myself through writing, creating a life-llng philosophical diary.

i have my own unique thoughts, ideas, concepts. Those concepts build up to make my own language, or at least patterns ( a 'pattern language'?) Anyway, it's worth keeping my own view of the world in tact.

### notes
implementation:  
the main web-site folder should be linked to a folder in the rathewolf repo, which itself generates the web-site on rathewolf.com (using GitHub Pages)

todo:
- it's starts by porting my old blog (Wordpress!!! lolll... yiikes!!  
- this is one repo that should have an appropriate license...
- add The Mind of Ra crowd-funding writings
- re-directs: mindof, themindof, blog, philosophy, philo
- make this repo private, but be warned: you cannot used GitHub Pages on a private repo

temp:
should use Wordpress to backup to an xml file first

https://import.jekyllrb.com/docs/wordpress/
  - official importers
  - https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-import

https://talk.hyvor.com/blog/migrate-from-wordpress-to-jekyll/
  - uses an outdated plugin, but not bad
