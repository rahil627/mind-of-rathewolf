### the mind of ra the wolf
a digital form of of my philosophies: my mind. It started as a blog which was a sorta philosophical diary intended for the public, that i started when i was 15

i have philosopher personality, and sometimes i express myself through writing, creating a life-llng philosophical diary.

i have my own unique thoughts, ideas, concepts. Those concepts build up to make my own language, or at least patterns ( a 'pattern language'?) Anyway, it's worth keeping my own view of the world in tact.

### notes

#### import from wordpress
ho. ly. shit. that one bad decision of using wordpress instead of writing my own site generator costed me. :(

currently:
the current `_posts` are from the python script
the current `_drafts_ are from the python script
  - **TODO: only 5 drafts were exported, need to merge with the other two imports (about 80?)**
the current `_pages` folder used the python script import as a base then merged data from the other imported sources
  - in particular, the auto-generated select-by-date-range lists were copied over (html copy)
    - TODO: should be able to re-generate these using jekyll
  - just remember to copy/paste resume, and you're good!


- see diff.txt file in root to see differences between the different importers
  - still need to try import via database (should be easy!)
  - https://import.jekyllrb.com/docs/wordpressdotcom/ has a link to a good tutorial with lots of code snippets too


- https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/432499/find-a-pattern-and-replace-its-value-in-shell-script
- just use sed, figure out regular expressions, replace, git push, check changes of the commit


- this is one repo that should have an appropriate license...
- add The Mind of Ra crowd-funding writings
- re-directs: mindof, themindof, blog, philosophy, philo
- make this repo private, but be warned: you cannot use GitHub Pages on a private repo

temp:
should use Wordpress to backup to an xml file first

https://import.jekyllrb.com/docs/wordpress/
  - official importers
  - https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-import

https://talk.hyvor.com/blog/migrate-from-wordpress-to-jekyll/
  - uses an outdated plugin, but not bad
