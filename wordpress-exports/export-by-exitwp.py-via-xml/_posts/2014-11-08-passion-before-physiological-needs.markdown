<blockquote>
~2/14/13 to 8/6/13 in San Francisco the second time:
The most important thing is having  a project to be passionate about. Then everything else, exercise, diet, social become secondary.</blockquote>





<blockquote>10/15/13
Why the recent laziness? Why am I not consuming as much? Need air conditioning? I didn't before! Pure motivation. Be more timely.</blockquote>



Proven many times by every dramatic film.
