<blockquote>the ideal life - move to a different country every few years. this would allow me to learn a new language, culture, and way of life, for every move. the problem is income. what job would allow me to live this lifestyle? can i run businesses in foreign countries? i would have to be the owner, with a top notch manager. even then, i wouldn't be a good owner, since i'm not near my business. i'd have to settle in one country for some time (10-18 years?), when i have children.
