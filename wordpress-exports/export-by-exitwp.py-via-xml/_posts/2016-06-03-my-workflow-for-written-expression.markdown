Continuing the thought from the [self-note from the last post](http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/in-search-of-a-past-time):



<blockquote>[self-note: this was published using markdown, and is a good for testing it. The original text is in a text file in Dropbox. Can either copy the HTML from the text file using an application (Writebox) or use the Wordpress markdown plugin. It seems I may have been playing with the formatting of highlights and notes, using unordered lists (via markdown), which led to some cosmetic updates to the CSS. I don't know how to write a non-html-list in markdown using "\n- text". I really sure hope all this messing with digital bullshit will make expressing thoughts easier during more active times in life...</blockquote>



It might be helpful to write down the workflow, perhaps minimizing it.

Here is my current workflow:
1. experience
2. think
  - non-verbal / skip to action, oral (in the mind or out loud)
3. decide to write
  - written is a choice among infinite choices of actions
4. express via writing to nearest material
  - paper, public computer, smartphone
  - audio recording an alternative worth considering
if written on physical material:
  - 4.5 transcribe to digital text file
5. publish to Wordpress


Here is my current workflow with current technology:
if using phone:
write via a writing (likely markdown-supported) smartphone application (Writebox, Plaintext [2], Byword)
copy text or HTML to clipboard
paste into Wordpress [web browser (because the Wordpress application sucks)]
  - possibility: can purchase an update for Byword to publish to Wordpress
  -- this [Byword publishing feature] might be worth purchasing*
  --- is it worth looking at alternative writing smartphone applications for publishing feature?: iaWriter*, Elements: Design, nvALT and WriteRoom*, MarsEdit, Ulysses (and Daedelus Touch), Desk [PM], Nebulous Notes. No. Stick to the simply wonderful Byword*.

if not:
write directly via Wordpress (if near / convenient; it never is convenient)
write to a text file using Writebox
  - Writebox is multi-platform, including web browsers, making it simple to use from any personal computer. This is the closing thing to physical paper.
