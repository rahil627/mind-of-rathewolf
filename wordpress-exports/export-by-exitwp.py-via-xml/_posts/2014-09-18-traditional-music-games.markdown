Connect Taiko No Tatsujin to tablas using Makey Makey at a Gurudwara.

Thoughts:
Foreigners will have to go to a Gurudwara, take off their shoes, perhaps pray, then play. Perhaps kids who play it will be inspired to learn to play traditional instruments.

Further design:
Perhaps can think of other traditional instrument, game, and place of worship combinations.




notes:
Drawing digitally is a waste of time. I thought it would convey designs better, but perhaps paper is better if I can find a good workflow.
