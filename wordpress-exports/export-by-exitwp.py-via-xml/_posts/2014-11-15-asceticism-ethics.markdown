This article for Design for this Century doesn’t excite me at all. It’s about internet advertising. Should this be knowledge I should know? Why? I’d rather live a simple life.

Perhaps I could use the knowledge and awareness from Design for this Century to create art to make people aware of those things.</blockquote>



Ignore the material world, live simply, and do good. Surely nothing _wrong_ with these ethics. Great if charity is included.

Until someone bad influences them. Or a disease is introduced. Maybe limit entering a high-tech society when something weird happens for help?

Burma must have been an other worldly sight.
