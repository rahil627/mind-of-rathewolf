[Old draft. Publishing anyway. Needs more work. Update 9/12/15: MIT Media Lab has a [Changing Places research group](https://www.media.mit.edu/research/groups/changing-places) which is based on this idea]

Non-physical -- media.

Physical and alone. Another technique to extend hypomania, and creativity, is to continually create new experiences. One way is to change work places, to change external stimuli. A new park, cafe, shared workspace, street, protest, train, wherever.

Physical and social. A better method is to create new social experiences. Cook dinner for friends, have picnic at a park, play a game, talk, discuss, do something with other people.

[Constant creativity](http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/constant-art-ethics) seems to almost require constant consumption.
