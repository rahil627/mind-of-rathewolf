Open spaces provide chaos.

Closed spaces provide organization.

The mind is an organizing machine.

Change between open and closed spaces balance chaos and organization.

Travel provides chaos.

Houses provide organization.

Cities provide flux.

Media can provide chaos too. It is up to the mind to organize it.

I've been reading books lately, so Calvino comes to mind.

The power of poetry (or poetic prose) is in it's conciseness -- it is able to convey an idea with a few words.

A power often associated with conciseness is the ability to redirect the user to another idea. To continually do this is a kind of flux.
