<blockquote>Hah, you're way more excited about this then I am. I'm still not interested.

My gripe about blogs is that I find 99% of them useless, including my own. I've never followed a blog, I've only stumbled upon specific well-written posts by people that I admire. If "how to hold a hamburger properly" was chosen to be "freshly pressed" then I deem Wordpress's standards for content is low, aiming for popularity instead of quality. I don't seek popularity; I only care for those few people who actually searched specifically for something I wrote.

Again, blogging is my lowest priority. Before I can write anything, I have to create/do something first.
