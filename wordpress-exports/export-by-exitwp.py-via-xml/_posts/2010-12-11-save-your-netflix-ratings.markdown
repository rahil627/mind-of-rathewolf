I have a data whoring personality. I have way to many things-to-do lists, and text files with data which can be easily found on the internet. I'm trying to move away from this, yet I still persist.

Previously, to download my Netflix Ratings I used to use a [script](http://tenhanna.com/greasemonkey/) in Greasemonkey, but that didn't work this time. After some Googling, I found [LikeMinds](http://www.likeminds.com/) (SaveMyRatings).

_"LikeMinds is a service for sharing your favorites and discovering new stuff; including movies, books, music, people and places, with the help of other like-minded people._

_LikeMinds also allows you to share your ratings with friends by quickly copying your ratings from different websites including Netflix, Blockbuster, Amazon, Flixster, Yahoo, IMDB, RottenTomates , iTunes, Winamp, GoodReads, Shelfari and many more websites and applications."_

I signed up and was able to import my Netflix ratings to the LikeMinds server, but I had trouble finding how to import it to a local file. Then I found this [link](http://app.likeminds.com/facebook/user/0/movies/ratings/export/?lmref=lm_blog). I had to log into Facebook for some reason, but it worked!

LikeMinds saves your ratings into a CSV file, which can be opened with Excel, then easily manipulated to however you like.

There were some errors. Some foreign movie titles contained weird characters. I even found a movie I can't find on Netflix--"Wild, Wild West: The Steel Assassin" from 1999! Regardless, my storage greedy personality was satisifed.

I went even further adding friends similar to me, which resulted with a list of "movies new to you that your 19 LikeMinds rated highly".

This list already seemed far more useful than any recommendations I've received from Netflix! Now if only I rated all of my music...
