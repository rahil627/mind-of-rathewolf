<blockquote>be moderate about everything [recurring thought]
4/2/2010 (dd/mm/yyyy)</blockquote>


Perhaps the [Golden Mean](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_mean) was an early ethical stance of mine.




<blockquote>It's peculiar that people who live a high tech busy life, may aspire to live a rural slow life, and vice versa. maybe lifestyles too should be taken in moderation. for 20 years you can live in the a developed city, then for another 20 years live on a farm. It doesn't have to be a consecutive 20 years, vacations count.

Vacations were created to balance out work and rest. Everything should be taken in moderation.
