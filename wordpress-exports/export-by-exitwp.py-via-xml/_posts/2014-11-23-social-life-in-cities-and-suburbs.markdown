<blockquote>9/3/13
Seoul was an amazing personal social achievement. I made close friends. I kept them. I balanced time, living and working simultaneously.

In Seoul I couldn't rely on sight-seeing to arouse my senses. I had to talk to people to make it livable.

My ability to create new friends, or my interest to, in Busan is not good.</blockquote>





<blockquote>9/19/13 in Tokyo, Japan
In Japan, I failed. With the help of Busan, the suburbs and Tomo's house, I lost a lot of ambition and interest in exploration.</blockquote>



In a few days in Seoul, I felt I had a good group of friends. In a few days in Busan, life was hopeless. How the accessibility to other people affects social life is clear.
