<blockquote>10/13/13
Perhaps I should live alone in a shitty room in Tonghua.</blockquote>



Unlike the [neighborhood](http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/the-ideal-neighborhood), the household doesn't matter much.

If one is single, it could be just a small space to safely keep belongings and sleep in. If the country doesn't provide cheap and healthy food, then there must be a kitchen.

If one has roommates, then perhaps it would have a living room that has an appearance similar to one's dream cafe.

If one a family, then I still think it should resemble a dream cafe, with more play space.
