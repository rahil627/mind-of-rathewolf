During my last week in Taiwan, I decided to travel the east coast, I was blown by the sublimity of Taiwan's nature -- karst mountains alongside a beach which erodes giant rocks in the most beautiful way. And as I went through different landscapes it triggered the memory that JRPGs evoked: travel. JRPGs are terrible because the mechanics are terrible. But simply being able to walk, explore, talk to NPCs, simulates travel. You go through cities, suburbs, countryside, and the people that inhabit them. These places and people exist. Art imitates nature. But I don't think ever connected that as much as I do now, after traveling so much. So although the games suck because they are not experimental, as a medium to consume, I don't think they are bad. and during the time, l learned I couldn't talk to myself forever and relied on media. I hadn't listened to music for quite some time. I use 8tracks [link to why 8tracks is better than AI] to find some J 2314 2014-08-03 07:11:40 2014-08-03 11:11:40 open closed jrpgs-emulate-travel draft 0 0 post 0 Uncategorized _edit_last 1 New Media I Liked http://rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=2909 Mon, 10 Nov 2014 07:09:30 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=2909 [meh, can do later.

 points:
 school provides an environment make mistakes, but is not interesting as practical use, and is likely not as interesting as talking to people in real life
 
 it's best to just quickly go over flash cards and grammar, then try to use them in real life. One use the grammar book's activities which repeat the vocab and existing knowledge, but what's the point? One should do the same with new grammar, as there may be several ways to to use the new grammar, and check with someone who knows the language.
 
 also a grammar book to quickly go through all the uses of grammar.

 After a long period of nomadism and travel, I finally spent time in one place: my parent's house. I ended up here because I came back to America to attend some weddings, and perhaps attend school. I decided against the latter part.
 
 How my mind transformed from extreme creativity to extreme oversleeping is pretty fascinating experiment, like studying the effects of prison on prisoners, and it serves as a lesson of personal human nature. I don't know if this applies for everyone, but perhaps artist personalities, and my mom.

 What's frightening is the fact that I stayed so long. I kept telling myself I just need to sell my stuff, but I could have done that through a garage sale in the first to weeks. I could have been much more active about it. There's definitely a passive element about selling things online. It's like having a store and waiting for people to buy your things.
 
 I also had what I called the "thoughts project", which is <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/valuable-things-ive-written" title="Valuable Things I’ve Written">basically everything I've written during the past few months</a>, and involves naive philosophical analysis of my own past. <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/no-more-writing" title="No more writing">Unnecessary</a>, but oh well now.

Without satisfying this psychological need, one can become depressed, especially when living alone. Over-think what t odo or where to go. One should just go, get out of the house. Cities are nice as one does not have to walk far to encounter people [an experience]. Asia works well too, with its scooters. The suburbs can be troublesome, as there are few public spaces to go to.

 The towns in Nepal and Darjeeling are easy to explore and social. They’re small with tons of cafes, nice surroundings, and cool weather. I also live in the city, so I go out more, build routine with local shops, do everything outside — eat, laundry, internet cafe, tea, and work. In Baroda, I do everything inside. That’s the difference. I need to live outside. Or, perhaps, In red to live with people [that I want to partake in activities with].</blockquote>
 
 
 
 <blockquote>Still thinking about why my time in Nepal and Darjeeling felt so great compared to Baroda. In those areas I spent my first six to eight hours outside. I talked to the hostel owners, travelers, local people, and was more open to talk to people, to meet people. I planned to go out somewhere once a day. I still wake up late, but it was okay. I spent every sunlight hour under it. Even at night in Darjeeling, I’d spend an hour or two at a bar because I wanted to be with people. It felt good. I did my work at night.
 
 In baroda, I lost my activity, motivation to do things very early. I could go to Mt. Abu, or other surrounding areas. I could meet people. I could be outside, although, I can’t work on a laptop outside because it is too hot, and the cafes are expensive, and just not very local. I could see farms, learn to farm, do some yoga, eat at local gujarati thali places, explore the city, explore the surroundings, making one day trip per day, but I didn’t. I was too focused on work, my next direction, that I lived less, not seizing the moment. Stuck at the house doing meaningless things.</blockquote>
 
 
 
 <blockquote>I’ve been in the house for too many hours. I always compare to how much life I lied in Nepal and Darjeeling. I need to be outside the house for as many hours as possible. I need to live for the first hour of the day, like Vidya, take a hike to a temple. I’m not as alert as I was before. My work is at the house, and it is killing me. I need to be like Fred. Live several lives per day. I have to keep walking and talking around town. Keep consuming, meeting people, and working.</blockquote>

 Towards the end of the Tang Dynasty, economic expansion led to less state regulation and restrictions being lifted on Night Markets. During the Song Dynasty (960-1279), Night Markets played a central role in Chinese nightlife. These markets were found in corners of large cities. Some stayed open for twenty- four hours. Song period Night Markets are also known to have included restaurants and brothels due to being frequently located near business districts and red light districts.
 
 The serving of xiaochi foods attracted Taiwan's local elite. Stories were formed of how well-known politicians and intellectuals visited Night Market stalls.
 
 Night Markets started to embody the local and the global modern popular culture because of commercial industries. Because of the global recession in the 1970s, canceled imports created more opportunities for vendors selling light industry and family made goods. This was due to more products becoming available to local markets. Night Marketing Networks were formed and sold Taiwan's light industry goods.
 
 Night Markets changed from places that sold traditional snack food and handicrafts to modern centers of popular culture. Markets rapidly responded to new trends by producing their own versions of popular goods, especially in the 1990s, when copyright and intellectual property laws were only loosely enforced. 3823 2015-09-08 17:00:25 0000-00-00 00:00:00 open closed draft 0 0 post 0 Uncategorized _edit_last 1 The Power of Public Transportation http://rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=3873 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=3873 In a <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/new-york-and-taiwan" title="New York and Taiwan">past post where I try to decide which place is better, New York and Taiwan</a>, I wrote:
 
 <blockquote>"Taiwan feels it goes further though. I can go to other cities, towns, or farms, beautiful natural places. This is because Taiwan has a fantastic train system that goes around the country at every hour, whereas the public transportation of America is limited to the metro system and infrequent buses with no stops on the coasts.The train has a huge enabling effect. I have a friend who works on in one city and commutes to another one-quarter across the island. It was very easy for me to move to another city and work. There’s a feeling that one could work anywhere on the island, save the mountains in the middle, because of it, and people do. Many people in Taipei school or work for a short period, or even commute from other cities everyday. Low-cost trains have such a strong effect that I bet if America was linked by trains, the suburbs would have died much quicker, having people move into cities.*"</blockquote>

 Here are some people saying that they do not understand what Zizek is taling about:
 He critices Chomsky for being often emipirically wrong. First for his defence of the Khmer Rouge, where Chomsky defends himself by saying that on the objective data availabel to that time, where he did defend them, he was right. Zizek opposes by saying, that on the base of the simple way in which the regime articulated itself it was clear, that the regime was totalitarian. Second he refers to Chomskys claim that we do not need ideologic analysis as the regime today is completly sincer. Here he brings to counterarguments. First he states that our way in which we and most politicians adress economic problems are highly ideologic. For this point he refers to Paul Krugman (Alfred-Nobel-memorial-price winner) who points out that the austerity policy is completly inadequt, nevertheless it is not really disputed. His second point is that especially cinicists are those who often are trapped in illusions.﻿
 
 
 To me, Chomsky is avoiding what he is afraid of approaching. It would disregard his basic view of the world and that is threatening for anyone. You can disregard this anyway as it is a personal opinion/feel.
 
 It depends on what you want in change- ultimately the objective of both, pragmatism as in dealing with practical issues (which is very limited in scope given today's predicament- what really can we to to make a lasting change?) or ( true- risky) idealism, a greater understanding and thus a subsequent change from within if you like. A change in ideology that would be naturally followed by pragmatic changes. In this sense, Chomsky vs Zizek is quantity vs quality. I believe history is also on Zizek's side.﻿
 
 http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jul/19/noam-chomsky-slavoj-zizek-ding-dong
 
 Zizek has a point about the limits of empirical data to draw conclusions about the reality of an ideology in practice. Noam has a point that it is dangerous to jump to conclusions based on an ideological and media bias and the importance of facts to gain a bit more objectivity. The racist nonsense lowers my opinion of zizek, Cheap theatricals that he tries to wriggle out of.
 
 The selection of objective facts is in itself a subjective act.
 
 This links to foucault vs chomksy. The impossibility to be objective if one is living in an ideological system. There are layers of subjective influence at work in any society.

 What most triggered this thought was the question, why do people watch sports, or rather, how do people come to the point of spending time watching sports? Especially when one does not actively play one, as for them it provides useful knowledge that they can apply.
 
 I believe the problem starts with being in a place with very little activity, <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/the-home-fallacy-or-nomadism-is-normal" title="The Home Fallacy or: Nomadism is Normal">such as a house</a>.

Then one has to be in a mode that is not pragmatic, having leisure time, doing absolutely nothing where the brain is in use, creatively.

 <blockquote>A Pattern Language:
 
 This book is very close to what I outlined to do, and moreover, it is written like a treatise, with each paragraph numbered and carefully leading to the next.
 I listened to some while scootering from Hualien to Yilan. The first paragraph mentioned a hierarchy of socio-political groups, from region to family. 2. Each group makes decisions about the land it shares in common, between neighborhoods, land between houses, living room. And thus it set out.
 One argument I remember is the size of a city. Where there is an upper bound to management. That one should be able to easily participate in civil decision-making, and not sink into beauracracy. I wondered about my tensions of living in big cities, and my comfort in small towns. How hectic Taipei is, seemingly unmanageable. It argues for small dense cities but with access to rural areas. I agree, and hence love Taiwan's towns and cities. There is no better feeling than being able to bike or scooter from one's house to a rural area, as I felt in Yilan, Bhaktapur, Penang, and elsewhere.
 Though public transport such as trains and buses are swell, the freedom of being able to quickly go from house to rural with a personal transportation is quite different.</blockquote>

 From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomism">a Wikipedia article on Automism</a>:
 <blockquote>Unlike other forms of Marxism, autonomist Marxism emphasises the ability of the working class to force changes to the organization of the capitalist system independent of the state, trade unions or political parties. Autonomists are less concerned with party political organization than are other Marxists, focusing instead on self-organized action outside of traditional organizational structures. Autonomist Marxism is thus a "bottom-up" theory: it draws attention to activities that autonomists see as everyday working-class resistance to capitalism, for example absenteeism, slow working, and socialization in the workplace.</blockquote>
 
 
 
 
 
 <blockquote>Economics is seen as being entirely political; economic relations are direct political relations of force between class subjects. And it is in the economic category of the social worker, not in an alienated political form like the party, that the initiative for political change resides.</blockquote>

 1. 寫現在的全動機
 2. 查思想，茶做什麼成功，做那事
 3. 用努力讓工作比較社會的
 
 current motives:
 - choose a cheap, calm place to live in the city (Richmond / Sunset of SF or Queens / Sunset Park of NY) with cheap food and access to Fablab and Hackerspace and Pan's meeting room.
 - keep an eye out for apartments which could double as a public space
 - create a schedule of courses and discussions in these spaces, using the appropriate Google Calendar,
 - be a part of my local community -- create an online post and physical sign on a local bulletin board and a physical sign outside the apartment I live in that lists my skills (babysit, work, computers, websites, marketing, etc.), my belongings (to share), my space (to share and talk), and my interests
 
 make everything I do social or profitable:
 
 funny neighborhood profitable ideas:
 - make and sell Indian food
 - ask buffet lady
 - can make day or night stand for special items
 - make and sell various ready to drink teas, including chai
 - game-making night market stand
 - go to the east coast (nature) and make useful items from natural or recycled materials and sell it at the market -- insect repellent, body wash, shampoo, deodorant, travel gear (light and heavy travel)
 
 self-education made social:
 - self-made book curriculum with discussions of topics
 - self-made film curriculum shown at my apartment
 
 things to be done in spaces:
 - choose courses of choice from master's programs I like, and create groups at the matching space, i.e. D&T studio at Fablab, play with software workshops at hackerspace?
 
 civic ideas:
 - create several maps for Taipei
 - neighborhoods

This reminded me of an old idea, that anything political (and aesthetic?) must start from primitive societies, otherwise I feel the thought is useless because it doesn't encompass all societies, often limiting the thoughts to the authors own narrow worldview. 4822 2015-09-19 15:15:37 2015-09-19 19:15:37 open closed start-with-nothing-2 draft 0 0 post 0 Uncategorized Two Modes of Work and The Pull of Capitalism http://rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=4972 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=4972 <strong>Two Modes of Work</strong>:
 To act upon nearly free-market capitalism often goes against normative morals, and against desired and well-thought actions.
 
 When I'm in a faster mood, I choose the higher wage, so that I work, work here being extrinsically motivated, less. I don't mind, because I have the rest of the time for my own work.
 
 When I'm in a slower mood, I choose the morally higher route: to never do that kind of work, and focus on what I believe is valuable work. I do mind, and perhaps view the capitalistic work in disgust.
 
 Choosing not to do thoughtless work means I end up with less money, therefore less choice in location of living (sometimes even kicking myself out of a city), and more house labor (getting groceries and cooking, hand-washing clothes).
 
 Sometimes I choose living in a small town, my parent's house, or a friend's house, and doing more hand-labor, to allow time to think. With enough recent experience, it may take me two months to dry my brain of all ideas.
 
 Sometimes I choose living in a city to gain wealth by the hour, so that I can do my desired work during the other hours, which may require wealth to pay for some expenses for my desired work.
 
 The model of the slower mood is a farmer, and the faster, an urban dweller.
 
 The modes of lives are limited by proximity. The rent in an urban area is too high for a farmer, and the population density of a rural area is too low for an urban dweller. Therefore, it is impossible to live both lives in the same area.
 
 Yet, it feels normal to alternate between these two modes of work. This makes this idea an argument for nomadic living, or at least alternating between two.

 <strong>The Pull of Capitalism</strong>:
 The ideation of the post was actually for this:
 
 Choosing the extrinsically-motivated work leads to huge societal changes -- globalization of capitalism and culture.
 
 A very good example is that of teaching English in foreign countries. It's a high wage job, but it is high because of the potential of communicating and working with English-speaking countries, where more wealth happens to currently exist. It doesn't further human progress in any way. The real value of English is being able to understand all kinds of media, natively English and those translated to English.
 
 Though there is no utility of many high wage jobs, the capital itself is attractive, pulling people toward meaningless work, likely associated with the production or distribution of commodity.
 
 The choice is there. One can be a farmer, but it sure is difficult to choose that when the alternative offers a higher quality of living, less work hours, and the city. 4972 2015-10-31 06:39:03 0000-00-00 00:00:00 open closed draft 0 0 post 0 Thoughts _edit_last 1 Why move? http://rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=5200 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=5200 If the <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/will-to-take-care-of-locality">Will to Take Care of Locality</a> exists, then why would one ever move? 5200 2015-12-02 08:15:03 0000-00-00 00:00:00 open closed draft 0 0 post 0 Uncategorized _edit_last 1 Toward Freedom http://rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=5816 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=5816

 29-30/12/15
 Slavoj Zizek - Reality of the Virtual
 People think virtual reality is interesting, but Zizek is interested on how reality is affected by virtual things.
 
 Lacan: Imaginary, Symbolic, Real.
 
 Imaginary virtual: When we have an experience with another person, we extract an virtual image from the other person, as opposed the the real other person. The virtual image is what affects the reality, and how we respond. The rest of the person is ignored. [To me it seems like communication.]
 
 Symbolic virtual: The next level. As an example: paternal authority. In order for the authority to be effective, it must remain virtual in a sense of a threat. If it were direct, it would be a sign of impotence, undermining itself as an authority. If a father lifts his hand, it is virtual, but if the father actually hits, it is actual, and the sense of threat is lost.
 
 Beliefs are virtual. Nobody really believes, we just have to presupposes another person to believe [need to reread this]. Example: Christmas, Democracy. There’s some virtual entity whom we don’t want to disappoint. So then the belief becomes actual.
 
 Our beliefs must remain virtual, because if we were to believe too virtually, because then it would be too self-destructive. We no longer appear normal, but as idiots. For example when a person actually takes religion or politics too seriously, there is something quite monstrous with that person, a puppet.
 
 Real virtual:
 To understand the Real virtual, one must go over the triad again, because each node is affected by three nodes:
 
 Imaginary Real: Images that are so traumatic, real, but too strong to be perceived. Examples, catastrophes, The Thing from horror and science fiction. Nonetheless it is imaginary.
 
 Symbolic Real: Example: scientific discourse, scientific formulas, like quantum physics. Why is this real? Because it resists symbolization. It is real but unable to think of it in everyday life. [The feeling I got after reading A Short History of Nearly Everything and Bertrand Russell’s Problems in Philosophy. Ontology.] It just works, but if you try to build an ontology on it, it doesn’t work, it’s meaningless.
 - [I found this interesting, because people must have the memory of symbols in the mind, using it a lens to reality, a kind of ideological goggles. For example, sometimes I think at the level of materials for creativity, materials for economics a la Marx, micro-level for science thoughts, using critical theorist ideas as a lens to describe reality.*]
 
 Real Real: Example: the chants that soldiers give during war — “I don’t know but I was told, Eskimos blah blah blah”. So, a descriptive detail? In the film Sound of Music, it depicts the nazi invasion of Austria, but in the film, nazis are dressed not much different from decadent Jews and the Austrians act not much different than fascists. So the narrative depicts one thing, but at another level, the micro-sense, there is a different message. In this case, it depicts an ideology of democracy while secretly displaying our fascist dreams [whoa]. [Deconstruction? The problem often is that Zizek relies on communication as his test case, as opposed to reality.]
 
 Another example: Robert Altman’s masterpiece: Short Cuts — 9 short stories depicting the life of L.A.’s middle classes: portrayal of alienation, solitude, etc. But, the texture (the Real Real) of the film is much more optimistic, a kind of celebration. It is wrong to watch the film simply as a critique of culture, but worth seeing the texture.
 
 The formula of the Real virtual: Rumsfeld, before War of Iraq, said there are known knowns (Saddam is the leader of the organization), known unknowns (number of nuclear weapons), unknown unknown (things that we don’t know that we don’t know, having some unimaginable weapon). He was missing a fourth category: the unknown knowns (things we don’t know we know but know, part of our culture, but do not recognize it, unconscious in psychoanalysis).
 
 The problem with American politics is just that: that they are not aware of unknown knowns [culture, ingrained social ideas]. The thing that controls us, but we are unaware of.
 
 Virtual Real [finally!]: Example metaphor: attractors of a magnetic field, iron filaments being attracted to a magnetic field? The magnetic field doesn’t exist, but it has an effect: it actually structures the elements around it [again, ideas embedded into the mind or culture but unaware or unconscious of, actually effect reality].
 
 The shift: Example metaphor: There is a shift in Freud similar to Einstein, that, from special to general, in the theory of relativity and in the psychoanalysis of Volfman. That, it isn’t a piece of matter being traumatically affected by another real force (space or traumatic event), but, the reality is that the force already exists, a kind of formal imbalance, and it traumatically affects reality [whoa!]. [So one must shift their focus from the symbolic real to the real real {a reference to the real} to really understand reality. The problems are within culture, ideas, etc., not the symbols of reality.*****]
 
 What does this mean for politics? How to use this to serve us in the analysis of political ideological phenomenon? Example: anti-semitism, the figure of the Jew, is an external trauma that intrudes social balance, curving social space. Class struggle, or more generally, social antagonism comes first. Social space is already curved, imbalanced. In order to account for it, we invent the figure of the Jew.
 
 Economics? Example: example alternative modernity: class struggle, dialectic of enlightenment, problems in capitalism, etc. are a part of modernity, and in thinking of alternatives or the future of modernity, it gets lost. The site of the antagonism is in universal modernism, universality. The site is virtual. All that exists are particular forms of modernity (anglo-saxon, Latin America, fascism, etc.). This is necessary to understand global capitalism. [It seems, basically, that one treat things in particular, not universal, to understand something as large as modernity, or global capitalism.]
 
 The category of the Real is a purely formal category, a structural gap, a pure difference, a difference prior to a difference, a self-difference. Instead of binaries such as the difference in gender, politics, etc., the difference is ontologically within the self, already existing. It is not a multitude as Delueze puts it. The binary signifier is primordially repressed [huh?]. Not human vs inhuman, not dead vs undead [?], a monstrous excess.
 
 Within problems of identity (politics, gender, etc.), the solution is often a multitude, that each identity should be able to develop independently, but this doesn’t work in the case of economics: one does not say the rich and poor should develop independently; it’s antagonistic struggle. [We are a part of the same culture, so one cannot simply develop independently in reality. An anarchic society is impossible. I think that’s what he means. But he is only taking into account modernity, the more developed areas, not different places and spaces.] It is not a universality of pluralities, the universality already exists: the universality of struggle.
 
 The paradox of struggle: universal truth should not be rejected by multiplicity to create independent truths, rather, universal truth exists, and only exists with each particular.
 
 …goes on to commodity excess enjoyment: decaf coffee and soda, especially the structure of the chocolate laxative, etc. Then gives examples using the chocolate laxative structure: in tolerance, people tolerate others to a certain point until it becomes harassment … [forgot argument here], in George Soros (sounded like Soros), he gets money through speculation of markets, then gives toward democracy, in war, all wars are declared in order to maintain peace* (imperialism because of humanitarian intervention), in the case of Iraq War, Iraq wasn’t attacked to remove the threat from Saddam, it was justified to help the people of Iraq. The same applied to concentration camps (a collective justifies punishment to the benefit of society). The same to Guantanamo Bay. Then somehow goes back to commodity, arguing that we aren’t consuming more, but less. Only drug addicts are the real consumers. That is why marijuana is good, it’s the safe opium. So the ethical injunction is not moderation, it’s to enjoy, and it’s what we feel guilty about: that we are not enjoying: you should learn to become a pitiless censor of yourself.
 
 The role of psychoanalysis is not to enable you to enjoy, but now to open a space in which you are not allowed to enjoy. You are not obliged to enjoy, you are allowed not to enjoy, which is different from being prohibited to enjoy.
 
 … [skipped somethings. 1: people who organize their lives into jogging, eating healthy, etc. is not good.]
 
 Reinvent a space of utopia: Not classical utopia of ideal worlds without much intent of realizing it (Plato, Thomas More, Sade), capitalist utopia (allows necrophiliacs to have sex with bodies, satisfying new desires, even extreme ones), the Real utopia — do what appears within the symbolic coordinates as impossible. Example: Nixon in China. Dare to enact the impossible. Modernity can be changed, not post-modernism. Don’t plan, practice utopia. It’s a matter of survival, the future will be utopian, or there will be none.
 
 [overall, it requires much experience in reality and of philosophy (continental, political, etc.) to even understand any of this. Though many arguments are lucid thanks to good examples and metaphors, it’s still very fragmentary. The topics are huge. The particulars are not there. The reality of the environment affecting human decision-making is not there. It is not complex. It is merely using metaphors and new words to describe the world, as much of continental philosophy does. The main idea is simple: look toward cultural problems, which is the basis of critical theory.] 5998 2015-12-29 15:19:00 0000-00-00 00:00:00 open closed draft 0 0 post 0 Communication Critical Theory Ethics Humanities Philosophy Political Philosophy Psychology Social Philosophy _edit_last 1 http://rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=6000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=6000 Marxist theories of space, which are predicated on a structural, i.e., capitalist or global determinants of spaces and the growing homogenization of space, are confronted by action theoretical conceptions, which stress the importance of the corporeal placing and the perception of spaces as albeit habitually predetermined but subjective constructions. 6000 2015-12-29 15:58:58 0000-00-00 00:00:00 open closed draft 0 0 post 0 Uncategorized _edit_last 1 Action and Determinism http://rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=6002 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=6002 http://lepo.it.da.ut.ee/~cect/teoreetilised%20seminarid_2009%20s%C3%BCgis/4_seminar_AEGRUUM_08.12.2009/3.Loew-The_constitution_of_space-2008.pdf
 
 The logic of inclusion and exclusion via institutionalized orderings is also
 followed by those who discuss space as a ‘product’ of societal interaction/structures,
 examining the production of social inequity through spatial relations in
 the empirical cases of virtual spaces (Featherstone and Burrows, 1995; Budke
 et al., 2004), global spaces (King, 1990; Chattopadhyay, 2005; Berking et al.,
 2006), and local spaces (Mayerfeld Bell, 1997). Space is accordingly a category
 with which the social sciences address inclusion/exclusion as a problem of simultaneous
 positioning, focusing not only on the symbolic dimension of the world
 but also on the material dimension. There is broad agreement in social-scientific
 spatial studies that space is a relational category; in other words, space arises from
 the activity of experiencing objects as relating to one another (Soja, 1989; Rose,
 1999; Crang andThrift, 2000; Sturm, 2000; Adams et al., 2001). Always keeping
 in mind the dangers of arguing in deterministic terms, discovering whether space
 constructed in this manner itself structures action remains a complicated problem
 for the social scientist. While it cannot be often enough stressed that no space
 imposes specific action (pedestrian tunnels need not necessarily engender fear,
 however empirically frequently this occurs), highly elaborated know-how has
 been developed about how deliberately to generate atmospheres in spaces (see
 also Thrift, 2004). This article attempts to show that structure-theoretical arguments
 tend to take account of the power of spaces to provoke social events,
 whereas action theory tends to conceptualize space more strongly as a result of or
 context for action. Materialist theory has always proceeded on the assumption
 that societal structures shape action in specific ways. To assume in analogy that
 
 spatial structures affect bodies is theoretically plausible and seems unproblematic
 because the subject of analysis is usually very abstract, as when Lefèbvre (1991)
 and Harvey (1990) stress that the capitalist spatial order is conducive to fragmentation.
 The closer social-scientific studies of space come to ‘micro-sociological’
 contexts, the more frequently space is ‘immobilized’ as context or locale (see
 Giddens, 1984; Werlen, 2000). 6002 2015-12-30 06:15:59 0000-00-00 00:00:00 open closed draft 0 0 post 0 Uncategorized _edit_last 1 _oembed_3d7c9894ef5450b3a39c82d9aec41be8 {{unknown}} Anarchy and Taiwan http://rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=6032 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=6032 [1/4 todo: A thought from a conversation with someone:

 In comparison, I think, there are fewer males that have imparted such values. Often, the males that have imparted some value in me are the partners of the females. I begin contact with the women and later become friends with the male, and also share a kind of homogamy (John).
 
 Perhaps it is because my male friends have imparted values that are more instrumental. They are friends of shared interests rather than shared values.

So, I figured I should re-attempt to link my philosophy.
 
 <blockquote>Martina Löw developed the idea of a "relational" model of space, which focuses on the “orderings” of living entities and social goods, and examines how space is constituted in processes of perception, recall, or ideation to manifest itself as societal structure. From a social theory point of view, it follows on from the theory of structuration proposed by Anthony Giddens, whose concept of the “duality of structure” Löw extends sociological terms into a “duality of space.” The basic idea is that individuals act as social agents (and constitute spaces in the process), but that their action depends on economic, legal, social, cultural, and, finally, spatial structures. Spaces are hence the outcome of action. At the same time, spaces structure action, that is to say spaces can both constrain and enable action.
 
 With respect to the constitution of space, Löw distinguishes analytically between two, generally mutually determining factors: “spacing” and “synthesis.” Spacing refers to the act of placing or the state of being placed of social goods and people in places. According to Löw, however, an ordering created through placings is only effectively constituted as space where the elements that compose it are actively interlinked by people – in processes of perception, ideation, or recall. Löw calls this synthesis. This concept has been empirically tested in studies such as those by Lars Meier (who examined the constitution of space in the everyday life of financial managers in London and Singapore), Cedric Janowicz (who carried out an ethnographical-space sociological study of food supply in the Ghanaian city of Accra), and Silke Streets (who looked at processes of space constitution in the creative industries in Leipzig).

When thinking about what I desire from her, it is this: I desire for her to increase her potential, to be able to develop, and the ideal method to do that is by increasing her freedom, and the practical method to do that is to move her to the city. It seems what I desire in personal relationships is the same in society.
 
 There is no gift-giving, the gift is human development.
 
 When I spend time in a relationship, I want to learn from that person's experience, share my own, guide the person to the right direction in knowledge and in space. This is probably why I enjoy social organizing: by connecting people with the right wisdom, through material (media, urban material) and people, I push them in directions they desire or perhaps will desire.

 My CouchSurfing host...
 
 There were two thoughts: 1. The Romani people were nomadic and creative. 2. They were have a history of being excluded (slaved, exiled, ethnic cleansing / genocide, beat, etc.) from other countries (including France in 2010?).
 
 1.
 Creative in communication:
 
 Creative in human language: Mix language to continually create a new language, piecing together their own, and the country they live in, using whatever works.
 
 Creative in artistic communication: Charlie Chaplin, many guitarists, violinists, certain traditional culture of music, painting, writers, crafts such as metal smith and woodworking, etc.
 
 Creative in sports: with a sports game as a constraint for expression, they excel in sports.
 
 Creativity in life: where I imagine most of the creativity goes is in their life. Their life is an ongoing performance, of creating dialog, actions, doing things.
 
 2.
 Because they were creative, nomadic peoples, they were excluded from non-creative, settled societies. They did not find capitalistic production enticing. It does not fit the life of impulse and creativity. So, they suffered, terribly.
 
 What's intriguing here is why other cultures excluded them. 6299 2016-03-28 16:21:09 0000-00-00 00:00:00 open closed draft 0 0 post 0 Uncategorized _edit_last 1 Temp List http://rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=6403 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=6403 ignore this!
 
 I've been writing in response to other writings recently, as opposed to experience. Not good. Here are some recent experiences to think and write about:
 
 homeless people in Taiwan
 - how to fix this
 - experience of being homeless
 -- exclusion practiced by institutions (unable to sleep at a convenience store, unable to sleep at a train station, not giving a free paper bowl or cup, flip-flops not allowed in certain libraries, passport required for certain libraries, etc.)
 
 a list of cultural problems or ideologies in Taiwan:
 - racism (foreigner, Asian vs Western privledge for immigrants), over-emphasis for recycling, over-emphasis on education, exclusion, guiding (rules) and inability to make self-judgement, fuze (responsibility, duty?) for social and professional relations (maybe from Confucianism!), disregard for urban planning (ride and park scooters and bikes anywhere, walk anywhere, etc.), disregard for the environment in general instead focusing on something (human behavior and attention, a part of which is capitalistic behavior), ancient exercise routines, dependency on groups, lack of creativity, lack of consumption of media from other countries, over-emphasis of social media, no thought about diet (or animal ethics), no thought in general (lol), etc.
 - look at thoughts when I first came to Taiwan. Compare with my thoughts in other societies. 6403 2016-04-18 04:02:55 0000-00-00 00:00:00 open closed temp-list draft 0 0 post 0 Organization Personal temp _yoast_wpseo_primary_category 210 _edit_last 1 Verification of the Decision to Travel http://rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=6564 Wed, 27 Apr 2016 03:43:11 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=6564 11/7/2012(?)
 An email to an awesome group of people:
 
 Heyo.
 I've got a really funky question that can't be answered by nearly any family or friends at home (I don't have a cool artsy Mom, but she does make yummy food!).
 But first, a quick update:
 I left NY to go to SF. In SF I tried to seek out a similar game scene and failed to find anything near the level of NY. It's only when you leave Babycastles (and NY in general) you realize how world class the people [and their works] really are. And how business-oriented SF is. I generally just attended events I was interested in (not just game related) and explored parts of the city, as usual. Most of the time, I've been working on a game with a friend in NY (Jon Stokes!). I recently left SF to come home and am currently experiencing some funky mini-depression via reverse culture shock after living away for ~2 years. Home is too comfortable. Anyway, that's not the point!
 
 NOW:
 I've been thinking about traveling abroad for some time, but I'm now questioning the reasoning behind it, although there isn't much rational to begin with. The idea is to live in a few places either in Asia or Europe, stop in India (where my parents own a home and travel to often), and continue around the world. At the end of it, I imagine crawling back to NY. I'll eventually have to get yet another full-time job to pay my debt to my Dad. Hurray upper-class Indian families in the hospitality business! Also, hurray high-paying programming full-time jobs which bought me time [at the expense of soul shards] to do things that I want. I guess this assumes all of my projects commercially fail. It's likely.
 
 I'm not the kind of person to travel "into the wild"; I need to work. I think I would be able to work on my own projects. When I'm excited, I'm productive. The problem is that I doubt I would be able to do anything meaningful with other people, as I have a meaningless background, I don't speak the language, and it's likely illegal. I imagine it's basically be me trying to make stuff while exploring. Not much else.
 
 THE QUESTIONs: Is simply having the feeling to live in certain countries enough of a reason to do so? And would the experience be worth it? Or is this all non-sense?
 
 [To me,] the more rational decision would be to come back to NY, the place that inspired me, and be as active as possible in everything, like you guys. Then again, I'd work for the Man again to take this trip.
 
 Hrmm, I guess this is more of a reality-check.
 
 LOL. Sorry to throw this on you two, after failing to complete trollkit and everything else. In hindsight, I think I was in an overly excited state of mind. Babycastles is too exciting! At the time I failed to find a cool job and decided not take up another day job and somehow felt making games [and film] was more valuable of my time, my first creative endeavor ever. Oh so crazy.
 
 Thanks for your time,
 I really do idolize Babycastles

 Kunal:
 
 Hey Rahil - my phone broke so my half answer is bust.
 It's a bummer, because I'm not sure when I'll have time again!
 But I'm going to emphatically say:
 If for whatever reason, you can afford to travel in any way, even uncomfortably, under-the-table jobs (more possible in some countries than others and that's very real), you should do it. I worked in India as a shitty journalist for half a year, I cleaned bathtubs in Japan for a very long time, in Ireland I just did freelance programming gigs I acquired in the US from abroad, etc. I just wasted money in Providence, Rhode Island right after college too, that I had earned in a high-paying job I immediately quit. Being somewhere is just a really good, good idea. Being stationary is just ignorance, and attachment to insular principles and conversation that need shaking up. I think that's just a straightforward truth. Go for it!
 
 Syed:
 If you have the privilege to travel then you should totally do it. My parents are both kinda of old and sick and don't have health insurance so i've had to stay close to the tri-state area most of my life. Apart from familial finical obligations whatever money I had left would go to rent and food. The only time i've travelled overseas was to visit my mom's family on my mom's birthday in the UK, that's also after i had a high paying job that i had just quit, but since then the only time i get to go anywhere is if people are paying for my accommodations.
 If you're in a place where your parents can help you out a little and you can take care of the rest then you should totally do it.
 Also I have this idea for this TV show that I want to pitch to IGN. It's like "Anthony Bourdain's No Reservations" but with game culture (independent or otherwise) around the world. The host will be Dan Alongi. If you'd like to help us write a treatment for and pitch it to our contact at IGN then maybe that might facilitate your need to get out of this country. An we'll all go on this great adventure.
 
 a very objective perspective of vagabonding

Imagine flinging part of the amoeba outward to try to move it. Would have to play with it. <ul> <li>The game of horse. One player creates the gesture, the second player must match it.</p></li> <li><p>When a player touches, a line connects each touch, allowing the player to create shapes. A simple game would be to let a variety of shaped objects fly by, and the goal would be for the player to try to accurately encapsulate the shape. Imagine a shape that has 10 vertices!</p></li> <li><p>A Mario Party / WarioWare like game. A bunch of mini games in which players compete or cooperate. Example game: drag the [single] coin to your corner. This may cause physical roughness. I haven't played BUTTON, but it seems like I'm thinking of old ideas. =/</p></li> </ul> <p>Games based off of feelings: - A romantic game. I mean Wong Kar-Wai shit. Atmospheric. Poetic. Now with interactivity! - A game that captures city loneliness. Hmm... Games based off of a new game mechanic: - A game in which you can move portions of an entire level, a room. When rooms are connected, the objects inside them can traverse through each room. Eh, difficult to explain in writing... <ul> <li>3D folding. See Fault Line by Nitrome for 2D version. Further thinking and exploration required.</p></li> <li><p>A two player game in which the players' screens contradict each other (think Between by Jason Rohrer). The game could start out with the players' screens matching (to condition the players what's normal), then introduce differences. For example, the one player could be helping the other by feeding him cake, but on the other player's screen it is shown as poison, and is only noticed through interaction.</p></li> <li><p>A game in which players play one at a time in order to create a story. Can even use an existing story making game. Hmmmm, I remember playing this on paper before...</p></li> <li><p>A slightly different idea. A game in which players play one at a time in order. The current player can see all of the past players actions. Each player goes through an avatar creation screen to create an avatar. The current player's avatar interacts with a main character at some point in time, a memory. The choices the players make influence the main characters path. Will the players cause the main character to defeat the enemy, wonder aimlessly, or cause suicide? Players should be able to see past play-throughs of the game.</p></li> <li><p>A 2D game with multiple layers. The player must traverse the layers, complete actions within them, which combined, solves the puzzle.</p></li> <li><p>A game which uses microphone input to move a character around, which also emits sound waves. Think Metal Gear Solid. The player quietly says "up", and the character moves up whilst emitting a small sound wave. A guard gets closer, the player panics and says "up" with a louder volume, the character moves up and emits an even larger sound wave. The sound wave mechanics can be explored. There could be items within the game that affect the sound waves in different ways: block it entirely, reduce the size, increase the size, rebound, invert. Could even make the game 3D. Devil Tuning Fork? So Pretty. Based off of an <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/can-you-imagine-yourself-as-a-verbal-assassin">old prototype</a>. Note to self: MAKE THIS HAPPEN. 2D, likely.</p></li> </ul> <p><strong>Non-experimental</strong> Games that would be fun to make and play (party games?): - A multiplayer game that requires the teamwork of 4 players. Each player has a certain occupation or skill. - A one versus all multiplayer game. Any genre. For example, if it were a platformer, have 3 lakitus and one player Games that are minutely different so that I can finish a game without killing myself: - An auto-runner game, but in which you have to manipulate the obstacles Games that could do well with a minimalist approach: - The Settlers like game. Or make on that works. - A real-time strategy game. A simplified Company of Heroes. Arena matches. 3 vs 3 units, 5 vs 5 units. Games that express a statement: - Occupy Wall Street - A game that simulate OWS. Top down, think Risk (board game), for each area of New York. The player can allocate protesters to each area. There would have been statistics for number of protesters, peacefulness, arrests, deaths, impact on the economy, etc. The main point was to show the player that peaceful protests do not work, only violence brings the attention of the public to make any useful change. Yeah, lame. <ul> <li><p>Corporate Workplace - Eh, I had an idea, but this is overdone.</p></li> <li><p>Impact of Human Resource Consumption - Might make this for EGP 3/12. Mechanics should be similar to a Settlers game, or a god game, so it'll be interesting enough to program.</p></li> </ul> 621 2012-03-15 16:54:06 2012-03-15 20:54:06 open open a-list-of-game-ideas private 0 0 post 0 artistic statement creative process feelings Game Development Game Ideas game mechanic Games _edit_last 1 _wp_old_slug list-of-game-ideas medium_post O:11:"Medium_Post":11:{s:16:"author_image_url";s:74:"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/200/200/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png";s:10:"author_url";s:28:"https://medium.com/@rahil627";s:11:"byline_name";N;s:12:"byline_email";N;s:10:"cross_link";s:2:"no";s:2:"id";s:11:"601bd822276";s:21:"follower_notification";s:3:"yes";s:7:"license";s:19:"all-rights-reserved";s:14:"publication_id";s:2:"-1";s:6:"status";s:8:"unlisted";s:3:"url";s:61:"https://medium.com/@rahil627/a-list-of-game-ideas-601bd822276";} _yoast_wpseo_primary_category _yoast_wpseo_content_score 60 _wpcom_is_markdown 1 inline_featured_image 0 Overclocking a MSI P6N SLI Platinum with a Core 2 Duo E6420 http://rahilpatel.com/blog/overclocking Tue, 14 Aug 2007 18:49:24 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=923 These are my overclocking results with a MSI P6N SLI Platinum with a Core 2 Duo E6420 (and a XIGMATEK HDT-S1283 120mm Rifle CPU Cooler).

Most of the time has been spent talking to female friends through smartphone messaging applications. Now, waking up late, I just want to look over those conversations and extract some knowledge. I can first look at the conversations, then I'll have to rely on memory.
 
 girl 3:
 current thoughts, written the day after having a long conversation:
 Compared to her, I have less than one half of her energy. She is active, up for anything, and willing to do anything. Game jam, play games, sleep at the jam and at my friend's house, run, join events, eat out, doesn't matter. It reminds me of me when I moved to SF and NY: doing without much thinking of it's effects on society. But at times, work is just needed to be done. Everything is an experience.
 
 Quotes from messaging applications
 <blockquote>
 her:
 我想我有點太興奮，沒有考慮到你的感受
 你可能很累，可是又不好意思打斷我
 讓我覺得有點罪惡
 不管怎麼說，能夠認識你，真的是太好了
 希望還可以保持一些連絡~
 
 me:
 嘿我知道你哪昨天，週末，興奮，哈哈哈。我覺得興奮的個性最好，好像我的美國朋友，所以我平常這樣出去玩！別想太多；別覺得罪惡吧。當然可以連絡。
 </blockquote>
 
 Her experience with me is similar to myself when active, in cities or when traveling at a younger age. She doesn't think much about other's feelings, rather, she's just having an experience. Yet, I think by telling me this the next day, she does think much, or at least, more than I did when I was her age.
 
 I've encountered this feeling of where Asian females feel and say they are sorry to waste my (male) time several times in the past few weeks. In this instance, she says she even says she feels it is a sin.
 
 <blockquote>
 her:
 抱歉
 讓你的行程，多延了一天
 
 me:
 不能延，我的行程是不固定的
 沒問題
 </blockquote>
 
 Just another example of her feeling that she is wasting my time or hindering me.
 
 current thoughts continued:
 On the outside she's a somewhat typical person who enjoys playing and making games.
 
 She mentioned that games have affected her, and really enjoys that she can experience characters with various personalities. She mentioned some dude on a motorcycle from the Metal Gear series and Zack from Final Fantasy Crisis Core, neither of which I've played. It was refreshing to hear this, and it counterpoints my current feeling: that the content of games shouldn't be focused on transmitting education, rather, just being some form of social interaction that brings people together in the same space and thus forming a new and real experience. I limit myself to the creation of those kinds of games because films are much faster at transmitting reality and books much faster at transmitting language. It's difficult for me to remember what I learned from games, but, perhaps, it was a lot, perhaps even, <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/jrpgs-emulate-travel">a whole lot</a>.
 
 I also wonder, was I at a younger age quite alienated, strange because I played games? Nah, I don't think she's too far from the social norm, her energy and playfulness makes her good company to have in any event, and perhaps in the past I was too.
 
 She said that she wanted to make games involving throwing tables at her boss. I replied that it was a good thing. You desire to organize your feelings in to a game, and, it's very likely that others feel a similar way and will want to throw tables at their boss too. This is the mind of a game artist: to organize experience and its emotions into a game, and to share it with others.
 
 She's been working for 8-12 hours per day at least every weekday for a year and a half (without overtime pay). When I asked her if she is able to listen to music, read books, consume media, she said not really. She must focus much of her energy on the work. That's scared me, because how else does on experience and gain wisdom? I told her that's the schedule of a slave.
 
 She suffers from the same problem of many artists under capitalism: she works at a place that is somewhat close to her desires in proximity to the place she lives*****, yet, far from ideal: a for-the-mass game producing company with all the ills of Taiwan tech work culture. I mentioned that perhaps that she should try doing a job that gives her a new experience, and use that new experience to organize a new games, which she can make herself, or with her friends, during her off-time.
 
 Her knowledge of games is also limited by the area in which she lives*****. She said she attended the past few years of game jams, went to a game exhibition in Tokyo (paying her own money), and probably went to anything game related in Taiwan. She desires to learn but is limited by access: Taiwan's game development culture is old, the city she lives in has one game jam per year, there are very few public game organizations [while writing this, I just messaged her some links to good game organizations], if any, in Taiwan. It really is up to her, the individual, to organize game events to keep experiencing and creating in the area she lives in.
 
 [probably missing some points which I currently can't recall]
 
 We talked all night, both of our limbs cold, like old ladies, needing to share a blanket and our bodies for warmth.

 <blockquote>raising a child in japan would be much easier than raising one in america. it would be a relief for the parents. the child would be surrounded by better people (better: more intelligent, better judgement, more respectful, etc.). certain culutural and familial values can be found in other countries.
 
 it's okay to go to school for one thing, and choose a different career. it's the learning that counts (or so i tell myself). the ability to learn complicated concepts, the ability to remember a vast amount of vocabulary (or syntax). most importantly to push your learning ability to the max. schools should have less busy-work and more thinking.
 
 recording every favorite media of yours - it's tough in the internet age. should you do it? everything you see is temporary, and just builds on experience. it's up to you to share for others, or for later viewing. still, i wish i kept a log of my favorite media.

 i need to wikipedia psychology and genetics.
 i'm fortunate - an old thought, but i haven't written it yet. i'm extremely fortunate in every way possible. great parents, top genes (mental and physical), raised well (middle class neighborhood, public schools, great parenting, temple, travel [it's better to let a kid explore the world, rather than keeping him in the house]), and i'm wealthy. it could be the reason that i'm always happy. if you have what i have, why would you be angry? although, i think the reason i am happy is because i have a 'happy gene'. if i were raised less fortunate, i beleive i'd still be happy. sure, there would be more stress, but i think i would prevail =). even further, i think i'd be more inspired! have more reasons to reach for a more demanding goal.
 
 oh right, the i'm fortunate thought comes to mind whenever the life in an undeveloped country is mentioned.

 <blockquote>It's peculiar that people who live a high tech busy life, may aspire to live a rural slow life, and vice versa. maybe lifestyles too should be taken in moderation. for 20 years you can live in the a developed city, then for another 20 years live on a farm.

 <h2>History of Work</h2>
 <h3>Chaiwallah in 羅東 (Luodong), 臺灣 (Taiwan)</h3>
 <p>from August to September 2015<br>I created a chai stall and sold chai at local night markets. A very simple and interesting idea in my mind, but quite a lot of work in reality, especially because I was coming from a more philosophical, theoretical mode of life. Still, very cool to be able to run a material business with very little startup cost. Very uncool for the people who do this to make a living.</p>
 <h3>Independent Philosopher?</h3>
 <p>beginning from at least March 2014<br>[Exception: This doesn&#39;t generate wealth, but I feel I spent enough time to warrant listing it here]<br>After a long period of travel and using another human language, I happened to stumble upon the Western philosophy section of a library, and then I attempted to write everything that I knew. All of my philosophy is available through my portfolio. [I was at home helping my Dad&#39;s motel during the time.]</p>
 <h3>Designer Cat and Programmer Cat at Catlard in 高雄 (Gaoxiong), 臺灣 (Taiwan)</h3>
 <p>from May to July 2014<br>I co-designed and co-programmed an augmented reality application with Simon (Catlard) for a very uncreative contracter. I don&#39;t know how Simon tolerated me at during my travel-high, but it brought back some fond memories of childhood game culture and New York game-making culture, which was lacking during the previous year of life.</p>
 <h3>Tutor in 臺北 (Taipei), 臺灣 (Taiwan)</h3>
 <p>from February to May 2014<br>I tutored anything to friend&#39;s friends. This decision may simply have been the result of personal survival in a capitalistic society in which one-on-one education is highly-valued. A pretty good out!</p>
 <h3>Exchange Worker (Slave) in Property</h3>
 <p>beginning from February 2014<br>While living nomadically, I sometimes exchange a few hours of work for free accommodation and a bit of cash for food. This includes: friends, CouchSurfing hosts, social organizations, NGOs, and wherever else I happen to sleep in. Notable NGOs include: a small health clinic for refugees near the Burmese border in Thailand, a human (sex worker) rights advocation organization in Penang, Malaysia, and a volunteer organization that builds houses for aboriginals in Taiwan. Sometimes, just a little creativity is enough for exchange. Applying the gift economy is more cumbersome than capitalism, but less repetitive.</p>
 <h3>Volunteer at 達達美語補習班 (Dada School) in 中壢 (ZhongLi), 台湾 (Taiwan)</h3>
 <p>from August to September 2012<br>This was my first gig during travel. One of the things I wanted to do while traveling was to try things that I value more than private sector work, in this case, teaching and managing a daycare.</p>
 <p>It was a work exchange at an independent school run by a fantastic couple: John and Ching. I assisted in teaching kids English by creating activities for younger students and having conversation with elder students. I also did general work: house chores, cooking, and babysitting. It felt like living with a great family rather than working. I wish I did more. Perhaps it was the heat (no air conditioner), or the mosquitoes at night, or Ching&#39;s delicious food that hindered me. Still, I managed to stay until my visa nearly ran out.</p>
 <h3>Volunteer Cat at Babycastles in Brooklyn, NY</h3>
 <p>from January to February 2012<br>Ahhh my first love. Amazing people doing amazing things. It was specifically what I was interested in, but had no idea a community for it existed. It was what I was looking for all along. At the time I was just beginning to create things myself (game prototypes), figuring out what games are, what it means to be an artist, and really delve into fine arts. The things these people accomplished on a daily basis was unbelievable. I merely helped setup and facilitate art game installations, and helped (or worsened) with organizational development. I regret leaving New York because of these people, and I will come back, despite disliking the city.</p>
 <p>The organization taught me everything: the possibilities of games, the possibilities of new media, social organizations for art and for social justice, event organization, income models to run such an organization, and the infinite possibilities with social relationships within the City.</p>
 <h3>Intern at zdLLdz in Brooklyn, NY</h3>
 <p>from January to February 2012<br>&quot;Interning&quot; with Zack. I &quot;assisted with a film shoot in the freezing cold and researched stereoscopy in film and games&quot;, though in reality, I biked through a Jewish community to get to Zack&#39;s place, ate delicious local pizza, and hung out at his apartment. Zack&#39;s an ambitious fellow on the edge of technology with an eye of a child.</p>
 <h3>Independent Gamemaker</h3>
 <p>beginning from September 2011<br>I began making games, using Experimental Gameplay Project as a deadline. After many finished an unfinished prototypes, game jams, and collaborations, I eventually helped my friends in New York create Crystal Brawl, a local multiplayer sports game. Unfortunately, one other game remains unfinished: Pinkies Up, a local multiplayer multi-touch multi-iPad game. I imagine game-making will be always be a part of my life. More detail in my portfolio.</p>
 <h3>QA and Release Engineer at Perfect World Entertainment in Foster City, CA</h3>
 <p>from February to May 2011<br>From suburb to city, I picked up a new job too quickly, perhaps afraid of financial risk. I oversaw day-to-day tasks for the engineering department. The department creates and manages websites (and web servers) for a bunch of shitty Asian MMORPGs. It was a cumbersome process in a large company. Unrealistic goals, overtime, hasty testing, shoving out <em>milestones</em>; The stereotyped horrifically inefficient software company. I knew and warned that I was going to leave within the first week, but I stuck to the job because I was still absorbing the experience of living in a city, and a pretty good one too (San Francisco). I tried to help the company as much as I could but I came to the conclusion that my slightly more ideal values were meaningless in a large company, and my desire for something more meaningful, or at least more meaningful than managing websites for terribly bland MMORPGs, made me leave.</p>
 <h3>Software Developer at Segin Systems in Virginia Beach, VA</h3>
 <p>from February to October 2010<br>My first &quot;professional&quot; job. I developed code for their flagship web based real estate software. Most of the time was spent implementing interfaces to scrape data from ancient third party title software databases to be sent via web services. The rest of the time was spent extending the superbly coded web site, written by the lead developer who made fine use of the then current .NET framework. An amazing, even ideal, first programming job, as there were only two other developers, and most of the time was spent programming. I knew I was going to leave my hometown, but I thought it was best to have a little &quot;experience&quot; before doing so.</p>
 <h3>Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at Old Dominion University in Norfolk, VA</h3>
 <p>from 2005 to 2009<br>I didn&#39;t perform well. I think I just needed to get out of my parent&#39;s house, or a break after high school to allow myself to take self-directed action. I did, however, value the time I watched neorealism films (thanks to Netflix technology), listened to indie music (thanks to Napster technology) and spent with my friends, often playing games competitively.</p>
 <h3>Assistant of the Manager at LaQuinta Inn &amp; Suites in Norfolk, VA</h3>
 <p>summer of 2008<br>This is my dad&#39;s second hospitality business. Franchises have so many rules; It makes having fun impossible.</p>

 - Grizzly Bear and Animal Collective took 4 listens before i felt the entire CD was amazing. in animal collective, the sounds and structure were new, you have to get used to the prevalent noise to really listen, just like you do for japandriods. at this time, i'm not sure why grizzly bear took soo many listens, i don't recall it having really foreign sounds, the tracks just didn't stand out, other than the single track "two weeks". i listened to that track many times before moving on, and i did the same thing with animal collective's single "my girls". after that, other tracks started to appear, along with new sounds and melodies that weren't apparent at first, my mind wasn't listening to these tunes before. this happens with each listen, until i appreciate the entire album. after the 4th listen, i'm enveloped in it so much, that it makes my hair stand. to me, this is my WATCHMEN of music, it's that good.
 - which leads me to beleive that music is indeed a preference. sure it takes intelligence, or i'd argue experience. experience, because the more experience you have, the more original music you've heard, assuming you always strive to listen to new music. with experiece, you can easily criticize pop music and anything simple. i imagine those who can criticize classical music, are people who know the details of written music very well. one who, upon listening, are going through all of the sounds in written form [in structure] in their head, annotating how original/clever a syncopation in one of the sounds [one melodic voice of a polyphony] are. i'm not sure how you can criticize jazz, as it's so improvisational...or again i may not have "got it"...
 - but this would imply that i share a lot of similar tastes with the reviewers at pitchfork. what lead me to pitchfork was how much i agreed with their numbers on metacritic. maybe there are some people who also started with metacritic, but found rolling stone's numbers agreed with their opinion. everyone goes to into their own group (clique). is pitchfork mine? i hope i'm able to progress to classical...
 - still, criticizing music should exist. it's easy to see point out why a band is trash. a publication needs to exist to keep the 7.0s and less in the garbage, away from public view and encouragement.
 
 classical - some can be improvisational, it's not based on it, in fact it has a lot of repitition. sure it has a ton of original melodies, but i think it more about how well the entirety is composed. i enjoy strings and woodwinds, but do not like brass nearly as much. i don't like marching band music. i really enjoy darker (minor) music. Vivaldi's Winter or Bach's Toccata and Fugue or any Mozart. seung pointed out that strings are the most sentimental, and he loves them/knows they are the best.
 
 lesser genetic make-up [this thought occured earlier today, and is one of those reoccuring ones] - this is one thing i don't think of. i even have a fear of the "handicapped", i would be frightened at a mental hospital. i just can't beleive how fragile human genes are. there's such a high chance that you'll have some sort of disease. i can't imagine that x% of people have disease y, and so on. so many people are suffering. i wouldn't want to live if i even had one serious one, i'm spoiled. the fear extends with thoughts of my child having chances of disease, and i'm not sure what i would do if i had a child with a serious syndrome. i wish there was a way to tell if the the child is fine within the first trimester, so the female could just abort the fetus. i think i would want a very mentally handicapped baby killed [yep, i'm evil]. sure the baby has emotions and feelings, but so do animals. if the baby is suffering [in pain] from a disease, i would want to kill the baby ASAP.
 
 it seems i've missed my creativity, and instead went for knowledge whoring. i really need to research creativity, to find a method to induce creativity.

 <blockquote>an update on the jazz from seung - he likes jams ("straight up playing, no songs or plan"). hearing people jam or improvise is like hearing an extension of the musician. he also just liked the sound of saxophones, and feels it has teh range of violins.
 maybe what makes jazz good is because only the musician who played their songs can play it again. it's very hard from someone else to read it, and play it. no wait, that's dumb. maybe my personality just doesn't match with jazz.

 <blockquote>indie rock is mostly about sound. if the band has an original sound, and the music is fun to listen to (even after 5 tries), then it's good. if the band does this, avoiding all of the cliches, then it's great!

 maybe i could work in america, but spend vacations at the farm. even college park had ditches filled with tadpoles, old bridges, and dirt trails alongside the modern world of electronics.
 
 the offset could be less learning about the developed world. there wouldn't be nearly as much wikipedia'ing, internet browsing, political terms, or home services. although, this would lead to a more independent lifestyle, with the will to learn.
 
 if i grew up elsewhere, i still think i would still have the same mindset, due to my genes.
 
 living in a rural settings would change the way kids spend free time, from video games to real life activities (tag, sports, nature, helping family/neighborhood, etc.). i played a mixture of both.

 <blockquote>college park was the perfect place to grow up. people (and their personalities), culture, sports, crime, adventure, and infinite fun. you can learn everything you need to know in a neighborhood like that. it forces you to be raised correctly, with much less parenting.

 <blockquote>The dream of living in the country, perhaps influenced by growing up in College Park, and later reinforced by Miyazaki films. I still dream of such a place at times, on the west coast of Taiwan, near the mountains, perhaps not too dissimilar from the hostel in Yilan; raising adopted aboriginals, playing video games, going on adventures. It was my childhood, but it seems so far from the reality of a neighborhood in Taipei. Yet, contrarily, seemingly quite easily possible. Yes. Do it!

 > Culture is simply an idea from the past. People who act by imitation, carry the culture: building boats, fishing, cooking, gift-giving, addictive social drugs, etc. Often, the act is conducted without awareness; it is not something decided upon by the actor. It is an unconscious action.
 
 > Somehow, abiding culture is [...? lost thought] received well? To enter a culture one must accept the culture's habits. If a culture is habituated to eat stinky tofu, it is an culturally acceptable action to make stinky tofu. Even if stinky tofu is bad for you. It (culturally acceptable actions) is not conditional.

Pretty please. Animals: Dear dear animals, skip to ‘AN OFFER…’. Animals of beautiful island: [todo: disclaimer in Chinese] <h2>the gist of the project proposal</h2> I’m a life-long philosophical diarist / conceptual thinker / essayist / human theorist / concept-and-idea-machine. Yep, <em>that</em> animal. Maybe you’ve seen or met that kind of animal before, but perhaps just haven’t peered into their minds. That’s ‘cause you’re not supposed to see their elusive minds! Normally they’d <em>never compromise</em>, but life’s circumstances finally got me compromising now, with <em>d’evils</em> (not you silly; the system!), proposing to exchange my mind for money. :( After many years of passionate living, it’s come to an end. I’ve recently given up fighting the nearby closed minds to get out of the trap and settled into a little shack on a patch of nature for the winter, just beside a terrible conservative Asian city. Upon planning how to get out, I’ve realized that my writings are all that I have left to share, and I can’t even get them. <strong>This project is to fund and enable me to search, fetch, transcribe, and organize years of my physical writings, self-“publish” it to <a href="http://rahilpatel.com">my web-site</a>, and update the site’s design and tech. [Yep, I’ll be doing <em>all</em> of the work myself.] These are my written expressions during a hyper-active, nomadic, ideal-seeking period of life. These are my past states of mind. This is <em>The Mind of Ra the Wolf (2011–18)</em></strong>…and I’m the wolf!: Ra. In the process of doing so, I’ll use the money to climb out of the trap and place myself in a good state of organization again: basically, get my shit together, and remember to think about money this time, so that this shit never happens again! Not to me or anyone else I encounter; And, perhaps even prove to y’all that wolves like myself, Patrick Joseph Falterman II, Chris McCandless are/were good animals with pure minds, if only the world could keep it as real as weeee doooo/diiiiid. <h2>AN OFFER FROM RA (part 2/2)</h2> <em>Ahem.</em> Dear good animals on the ‘puter-web. My good friend Ra the Wolf of the beaches of Va is in trouble, and needs your help: <em>He lost his mind(!!!)</em>, and has no way of getting it back together. Please halp him piece it back together. And in return, he promises to share it all with you, by putting it all in-to his web-home. For proof, he gave me recent marks and pictures for you all to see. I put them below. That is all for now, natural ones. After you are done looking at the proof, you can try reading a story about his mind that I’m currently working on. I put it even further below. <h2>excerpts and photos / PROOF BY RA</h2> Yo. I just looked through some recent thoughts files, quickly picked a few out, and put it on my web-home. I hope it’s enough! &lt;3, Ra Rarararawr! <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/excerpts-for-the-mind-of-ra-the-wolf">Excerpts: American-cultured: keepin’ it real / bein’ real / what is real? (with black media culture), what is a fighting game?, some more thoughts on<em>Wolf Children</em> philosophy-cultured: expressive vs instrumental modes of life, some thoughts on crowd-funding utopian-cultured: sun-day, communal and living spaces, outlines for building care </a> [1] My writings that I currently have on me, including [2] notebooks #3 and #4. All previous notebooks were written neatly in pencil like notebook #3, but way more concisely, and even more passionately. [3] A mess. My oh my. My, oh!, me. My current dwelling. [picture with me facing side-ways] [picture with me facing the camera] [picture without me] <h2>the detailed project proposal</h2> I currently have a mess of things I’ve written on with me, including two of my main notebooks (photoed above). I have few more notebooks, but retrieving them all will require copious amounts of…luck (more on this later). In the case that some writings really are lost, I promise to make up for the lost work amount by organizing a similar amount of my digital writings. Both, the physical and digital writings date back to when I first left my home-town in 2011. I will transcribe them first by photo; Second, by typing,, adding missing context, redacting personal info, quickly adding a few notes on obscure entries: basically just cleaning it up in the process; Third, by organizing it all (plus the content from the current site) into a new web-site, adding categorization info and web interactivity. There was only one period in my past that I actually attempted to transcribe my writings: It was during another period of isolation and poverty in 2014, but after a post-travel high. It resulted in a sort of child-like philosophy foundation (in a good sense!). That was the beginning of the project. Over the years I added various writings to the web-site when convenient during less nomadic periods. (Visiting the site is clearly the best way to understand what this project is, and perhaps even help me figure out what kind of wolf my mind may belong to!). Though there appears to be a lot of content on the site, it’s only a fraction. Since then, 3+ years, I never looked back at any of my physical or digital writings, and even during that single time, I think I just selected a few from my digital writings. Furthermore, it’s missing all of the content written on an e-book app, and books at home. Still further, that single transcribing period was somewhat derailed by its previous period, which was full of academic bull-shit because I was using books by professional academic bull-shitters as an aid to try to find ways to express my then wild mind into words. Don’t worry, won’t happen again. I haven’t read anything since! I’m on my Black American <em>real</em> shit again, as I was when I was grew up in VA. In the end, I hope all of the physical stuff is on the web-site, and that the new site design is at least decent, like my current site, but with a way way better work-flow. At least that’s my humble proposed goal for design anyway; I really wished more could be done. Although simply throwing the content into a web-site is the highest priority, I just want to point out that the web medium is always a conscious choice. This is not merely a book. This is my mind. The web medium was chosen intentionally so that people can actively traverse my mind, not merely listen (when I made the site in early high school, I wanted to make a Wiki, but for some reason chose blog software). The web medium keeps the possibilities open; It allows me to create tools to make a better interactive experience: Concepts dictionary? Should it have titles and categories? How could related concepts interact with each other? Related discourses? Tool-kits to aid thinking? Drawings between words? Photos to concepts? Should it interact with the people? <em>Mind games?!</em> And so the mind further organizes itself naturally over time. Besides, isn’t that what the web medium was made for?: linking places to content; Just as the mind links concepts to content. The strange thing is that I have so much content, but never look back at it… Anyway, my passions and creativity are currently at a life-time low, so, perhaps this is a good time for <em>mere</em> organizing philosophies… The money will enable me to live better days and go back to doing some <em>real</em> organizing: commune-making, starting by transforming my current home into a communal space, then creating more. :) And now, the ultimate test: <em>…Can a purely public crowd really fund purely passionate people?</em> <h2>THE STORY OF RA THE WOLF AND HIS MIND (part 1/2)</h2> [note: I didn’t add any links on this KickStarter page. I’ll maintain a formatted version in the full proposal on my web-site.] Ra is a wolf from the back-yards of a hood in Va. As far as Ra can rarember, he had a text file where he would put all of his markings, mostly for keeps-sake: notes.txt. Later, in middle-school, he created a new txt: thoughts.txt. Now when he wanted to make a mark, he separated what he felt was practical into notes.txt and impractical into thoughts.txt. A little later, he made his own home on the computer-webs. It was mostly a place to share bits of stuff with friends, and his notes.txt with other computer-web walkers. He felt he didn’t know anything that the web didn’t know, so he didn’t share much. Just a little after that, in high-school, he watched movies, then “films”, then realy “films”. He loved “films”! He loved Netflix too. It made him think. At the end of a good a “film” he would sit and think, playing it again a high speed to review, then, go to his room still thinking, and some-times even mark. His thoughts.txt grew and got bites. Nobody wrote anything good on the internet about “films”. So, he shared his thoughts about what he loved and didn’t love about “films” on the internets. It was the earliest impractical markings that he shared. He didn’t care much because he knew it was nearly-impossible for animals to find the location of his web-dwelling, unless he told them, which he didn’t, unless they asked. He learned everything from “films”, Wikipedia, and back-yards. When the time came for Ra to leave his hood in search of a better one, he took all of his computer bits and pieces with him. But he soon discovered he didn’t need them: The world is the realest “film”!…And suddenly, thoughts.txt grew quickly, with the help of a handy pouch-computer. For years, thoughts.txt grew and grew (it grew so large that it could hurt txt changers!). From yard to yard to hood to hood in Va, to hood after hood in giant colonies, to habitat after habitat. “Why watch ‘films’?” Ra would respond, as he watched and lived in the world. Then, one day, at a book-place in a busy city on a beautiful island, he stumbled upon the “Philosophy” of Cold Places section. He never read books unless a human bullied him to—only a few “art books” like The Watchmans and The Invisible Dwellings. He loved “films”, fighting games, mothers, exploring, but not books. But when he picked up Francis the cooked pig’s “essays”, something happened; Though similar to Invisible Dwellings, it was about real dwellings, and the real animals that dwelled in them!! Then he tried Michel ‘de lone wolf’s ”essais”. It was also about real dwellings and their animals, but much warmer, even friendly (somebody must have placed it in the wrong section). Then Bertrand the sharp owl’s story of “philosophy”. He was the coldest, yet the funniest too. Most of them came from cold cold places. Then the books the story…and so Ra continued for a few months. Do you know what happens when thoughts.txt gets some friends and goes into a folder? The thoughts become categorized, the mind aches, the soul yearns to throw it all in the recycling bin. Before then, he thought thoughts.txt was useless, just a stupid diary-journal-thing with a mess of thoughts and day-dreams. But that day, he saw other peoples’ thought.txts under strange strange names: “essays”, “philosophy”, “discourses”, “dialogs”, “treatises”; And a few days later, he even found some “essays” and “philosophys” in other sections too (probably placed by the same messy animal). Though he was able to ponder a about the world in his mind with “essays”, just as he did as before with “films” and “art books”, and just as did later as he wandered the world, he felt that most of the “philosophys”, especially the ones from cold places, are stupid because they distract from animal cruelty and the making of good habitats; That was his “philosophy”. That winter, he went back home to his back-yard in Va. Ra’s a sub-tropical wolf, so his mind became numb in the cold again, as it often was when he was a cub in Va, much like the “philosomals” of cold places (except the “marksists”). He decided to make use of the dumb time by beginning to shove some of his own past warmer sub-tropical thoughts in to his internet home. He felt it became warmer, and to his delight, even he felt a bit warmer, surviving that winter. In the end he called it: “philosophy”! Later, “Final Filosophy”!! And as soon as it appeared, the warmth appeared, and Ra disappeared, back to the warmer, beautiful island. Another year passes as he seeks ‘n dwells in various comfy shared dwellings with other animals, always thinking about animal cruelty and dreaming of more comf… … … … uh … uh-huh… hold on. <em>Footsteps go into the distance.</em> … <em>Voices continue at a distance.</em> … … … … … YOU WHAT!?!? HAVE YOU LOST YOUR MIND?! <h2>let the FAQs TOC, and a magic trick</h2> That’s it: That’s really the gist of it. I initially wrote a lot lot more, but then decided to move it to my web-site for easier reading and editing. it can be freely skimmed and skipped as you wish. Hopefully it answers any questions that you may have: <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/proposal-for-the-mind-of-ra-the-wolf">Where was your mind while you wrote all of this? What are some of the writings about? Where does all of my / our money go? Where would extra money go? Why aren’t there any rewards, what do I / we get out of this, and why should I / we care? Can I ask you something else? {todo: missing, can people ask through KS?} What are the risks involved, if any?</a> The trick: The more you read, the more we share, and hopefully, the more you will want to fund me. :) My current habitat. [picture of sun-set] [time lapsed picture of the sun-set] [pan to sky] <h2 id="thisisadefaultksheader">risks and challenges</h2> <em><em>The hard part is over</em></em>: living passionately during most of my 20s. Transcribing it all is just a chore, like cleaning one’s own room. The problem that remains is childish: <strong>I hate cleaning my room</strong> and other chore-like work (in addition to not owning a room, lol). Normally I’m wayyy too active to do this sort of detached, non-social, non-creative work, but, luckily for this project, I’ve been alone for some time now, and the dryer winter nights have just arrived. <em>Praise the weather gods too!</em> <strong>Poverty!</strong> Haha. I now have the essential human needs, but no electricity. I charge at a nearby out-door socket. Hence, the solar panel idea. If necessary, there’s a pleasant library, but, please, let us hope that I remain in the sun’s light. The library even has computers [with Windows OS] for public use. Hence, the old iPhones being way way more valuable than a laptop. Otherwise, I’m just bundling up for some wintry writing, and hopefully make a comfy space for anyone to join. :) <h2>bio (and contents of mind) during the writings</h2> I believe the last two notebooks (#3-pink and #4-tan) mostly cover a period of isolation and poverty (mostly losing hope against conservative / closed minds), with the exceptions of one short hitch-hiking trip in Japan, and two short communal stays in Hong Kong and Taiwan. I believe between notebooks #2 and #3 I mostly wrote digitally, covering a long period at a commune (mostly utopian thoughts :) :) ). My second main notebook, which is most likely lost forever, physically and digitally, I believe, covers my deepest philosophy period (the deconstruction of the world and mind: human treatises). Those three were mostly written in Taiwan. My first main notebook, I believe, covers my travel observations in more various areas in Asia (the development of the world: “human geography”†), when I had some money and incredible health to travel with relative ease. I believe my writings before that, in “great” American cities, were written even more disorderly, approaching entropy. But let’s not go so far back yet; Instead, for now, let’s shove that mess back into the digital clouds, <em>praise the Dropbox gods(!)</em>, and move on. <em>€ The bureaucratic academies isolate to better mis-educate pure minds and drain pure souls by stuffing them into impure departments with impure titles (think: Harry Potter ministries), such as this one.</em> <h2>contents of the writings</h2> I’m guessing the content is what the backers care about, that or good will, which is where my wandering personality may not be good at all, since the content wanders with me. After just skimming a few entries, I believe it’s mostly just like the samples I provided in the proposal. I never look back at them, so I’m not certain if they’re all like this, but, I know it’s sorta been like that since high school. It’s actually kinda creepy reading them… Is this normal? Should I seek a local shamen? Also, I currently have no idea what I will do about the more diary-like entries. For the sake of continuing though, let’s just talk about the rest of the contents. The content of <em>just the last notebook</em>, off-the-top, includes: the poverty trap, what is tradition?, what is a conservative / narrow / closed mind?, institutionalized cultures (White, Chinese Taiwanese, Korean, Japanese) vs real cultures (Black American, Native Taiwanese, hippies, punks), American media culture, political correctness in cultures (west coast vs east coast in US and Taiwan), American sub-cultures (competitive gaming!), community and personality theory, community and cultural theory; and the normal stuff: reflections on my past experiences, personal desires, development / environmental state of mind, lots of utopian thoughts and day-dreams (practical and theory), anarchy, community, commune-making, place-making, capitalism, human values (and intentions), what is natural life?, comparison of behaviors and ethics, etc. etc.:<strong>basically, what you would expect from a child-at-heart encountering various strangely behaving adults: zombie, android, and human adults.</strong> <em>Note: This is the poverty notebook…so the contents aren’t as bright as the earlier video game art days.</em> Though the topics seem dense, the writings are rather short, straight-forward concept-oriented thoughts; They are not fully-developed ideas / essays, though, later entries may be lengthy. There is no “social research” in the academic sense, whatever that means. <strong>There is only me thinking of my own past personal experiences, me thinking and feeling at certain moments, me dreaming, all the while trying to keep it real.</strong> The best I can hope is that my writings have a plain, direct, real style (like personal essayists; probably Graeber), but with the far more important, practical, emotionally-motivated content of any real rebel (like anarchists), as one would expect from a kid that hangs out and plays on the streets all day. So, no grand narratives like <em>Debt</em> or <em>Sapiens</em>, but more about <strong>what’s on my mind as I’m just try‘na to live right, do naturally, and get by: building utopias and constantly clashing with non-cooperative, non-altruistic, capitalism-determined, party-pooping people throughout my life.</strong> All I have to offer are <strong>my own sheer direct personal expressions: observations and experiences, feelings, wanderings, imagination; and, my later rationalizations of it all</strong>. So that this time, there is no one to cite or blame but myself. And if it still sucks, I’m cool with that, <em>‘cause I’m cool like that.</em> <h2>recovering lost writings</h2> If I get a laptop, I can try to repair my external hard-drive, which might have a photo-copy of notebook #1 and hopefully even some of #2 (along with lots of valuable photos and other files :( :( ). If it’s possible to fix my e-book reading app installation, I might be able to fetch additional thoughts and writings that I wrote directly into the app as annotations. My e-book library <em>was</em> my main library, containing highlights and annotations of 50+/- books [pictured] from the only period that I ever read books (also in 2014). The last bit of writings are at home, safe, in America: notebook #1 (<em>I think…I hope…</em>), older notebooks (let’s say #0) and a bunch of scribblings on the margins of books of my physical library. I believe I lost my best notebook, #2, at an airport, the phone with the photo-copy of it at a library parking lot a period of time before that, and the laptop with everything at a city a period of time after that. I should have known #2 was always destined to have the most shit and receive the most shit. <h2>where the money goes</h2> <ul> <li>75–92% ~3 month’s worth of labor, and gear</li> <li>5% KS fees</li> <li>3–5% payment fees (pro tip: $10 or less and the banks win)</li> <li>0–15% taxes?† € <em>The theory is that as long it counts as “expenses” for the project, and that the “tax year” is the same (it will be), it should be 0%?

Y’all know KS amounts don’t make sense anyway as the labor wages and living costs depends on each individual!… I decided to triple it, setting it to about 3 months <em>minimum</em> wage ($3000 + $150 KS fees + $150 max payment fees + $0 min taxes). ~3 months of lower quartile to median wage ($6k to $9k) is my ideal goal (and I’d be riiiiich biiiiich), but, alas(!), that’s not how KS works. Anything beyond that goes to the commune stash: maintaining a communal space, and, in turn, nurturing and providing for outcasts, artists, and other pure-hearted-lifestyle peoples. [todo: I’m not sure if I’m allowed to use the post-funding-goal-money elsewhere; check rules if it ever gets funded] If I get enough money for an old laptop (RIP beloved late 2013 MacBook Pro 13”), or gifted one by a contributor, I will be able to take more time to create a better digital writing workflow and even spend some time on site design (RIP Wordpress and RIP my beloved site design, since 2003). At the moment, all I have left is an iPad Mini 2 and a bluetooth keyboard, which, as this proposal proves, is surprisingly good enough to begin! Just to be clear, this project will be self-“published”, publicly available digitally, on the internet, free, just like my past “published” writings. There are no intentional profits beyond the amount KickStarted. There are no intentions to use a publisher, neither paper or digitally, not even to “anarchist publishers”. What’s a publisher anyway? {<em>begin GZA track</em>} <em>A penguin with random teks cashin’ in on random texts, uni-checks, O/R hex? Real birds jinx(ed): This is only built 4 computer links! :P</em> Besides, this way we save nature from humans, humans from labor, and labor from property. Honestly, this is just a way I thought of to get out of poverty while still doing “work”. By funding this project, I’ll be able to get the gear not only to do this project, but also <em>enable</em> me to do more digital projects, giving me access to the digital market…of projects. After the winter season, I’ll gladly go back to the art-life of balancing hippie market labors and labors of love—but first, I just want to fly out of the trap and make sure this shit doesn’t happen again. <h2 id="ksrequired">project dead-lines and project scope</h2> Normally I’d do this whole thing at my own natural pace, but KS un-naturally enforces a dead-line; I guess that means this is “work”. My sole dead-line is in 4 months after the money comes through, and the first month is just a safety net for initial money transfers, ordering gear, making home comfier, and getting social again, before I get to work. The work period is 3 months. This is a public on-going web project that you will see growing as I do more work. There’s nothing to hide. There’s no need for other dead-line; That’s the beauty of digital works. So, at least I get to work at my own natural daily accord. If for some reason you are raging to see it, I can provide a link to photo-copies (as long as you’re not a creeper out for personal info). The order of work: search &amp; fetch writings asap, get money, get comfy, order gear, do the initial web stuff, then transcribe and tinker with the web-site during the night. <h2>a disclaimer for post-funding-goal contributors (<em>if it ever reaches that goal…</em>)</h2> I just want to emphasize that <em>the main scope of the transcribing portion of the project is just that: a transcription of my physical writings.</em> It’s that simple. Actually thinking about and figuring out what I meant [at that moment], drawing out long essays, philosophizing (thinking about whether it is true or not) are all not part of the scope. Though, at times, it will surely naturally happen during the process. Knowing myself, especially at this age, I probably won’t get too entangled in it this time, at least not the philosophy part of it. How deep I get into the work, <em>time will tell</em>. Having said that, I feel the more money this project would get, the better I would be able to at least re-express myself (re-word), organize everything (by entries, then fitting multiple entries together by topic), design the web-site (layout and interactivity), and get closer to more accurately capturing and expressing my past thoughts and mind states. (Again, wander my web-site to get the gist of what the heck I’m talking about and how I did all of this the first time.) An enormous amount of writings were written digitally, along-side the physical notebooks. Though larger in quantity, I feel they are less consistent in quality of content and surely even more disorganized than my physical writings. After organizing ‘make-up work’, if any, then, any more money might just nudge me to re-attempt the crazy project of the organization of everything I’ve written. That seemed near possible 6 years ago, when I wrote very little. Now, I’m not so sure. Although 3 winter months of labor is the ideal project cycle duration for me, thus far, this has been a on-going life-long project (which is good, because for tax purposes, I think I’m supposed to try to spend it all on the project). The hope is that after piecing together a good set of tools and doing this much needed bit of initial organization, I’m set for life, able to think, write (express), and publish near simultaneously without technical disturbances and without ending up having to lug around and lose yet another mess of things I’ve written on…Well, that’s yet another theory anyway. <h2>a disclaimer about the rewards</h2> Beyond the first enforced reward, there really aren’t any rewards. I care about nature, material workers, and postal workers. I doubt shallow rewards could satisfy a contributor of mine (save delicious foodstuffs). :) By contributing though, you can join the conversation (and dialectics?), hopefully about making a better world, and I’ll take the time to listen, think, imagine, and share with you. I’ll digest whatever advice or info you’ve got, whatever desires you have into consideration, with a wayward fight. Everyone will be able to contact me (e-mail, maybe a messenger) and more importantly, each other (we can talk through KS initially, then perhaps move on to a Slack sort of medium?)! If there’s anything else, I’m sure we can figure it out. Though, fair warning: at times my reply speed can be slower than postal pack-mules slowly treading through mountains. The contributor community has only now come to my attention. Just having <strong>a community of utopian contributors come together and hang-out digitally</strong> is an awesome idea in itself. Even better than this entire project!… Hrmmm… The organization of contributors really might just be the best reward… I’m sure more opportunities for more natural gifts will come up… Oh! I know…!: Another benefit that comes from the project will be my optimal digital workflow. I’m quite notorious about wanting to express my mind as quick and as portable as possible, no matter the medium. As a result, I often search for and customize a neat minimalist tool-set to halp me do just that [todo: link to work-flow post] (technically: think: mobile writing app using text files with markdown-like syntax on Dropbox to auto-generate web-posts). So, for those that regularly express themselves digitally, perhaps via mobile devices, I could serve as a friendly digi-artist kindred spirit. Was there ever an e-zine movement? Hrmm… This [rewards system] is a tough situation: <em>What’s in it for you?</em> Well, I think it was Oscar Wild that had a tough answer: ~’It wouldn’t be art if it depended on the public’s opinions and desires.’ It’s not about what you want. It’s about what we want—the artists in all of us. Then, <em>why should I / we care about your art in particular?</em> You shouldn’t have to care; Only if you want to. Even my poverty notebooks are no better than a prisoner’s notebooks, or a parent’s home. But, if we share some values or even just interests…who knows, maybe that’s how care develops? Altruism is but a dream. :( If you fund me and have no intentions to participate in the communications or art-making, then, all I really got is love for ya. For, funding me and expecting nothing in return is the purest contribution (and, maybe even a way out of capitalism!). <strong>&lt;3</strong> <h2>a coincidental benefit: the kick-start of the future</h2> This project would coincidentally also serve as the beginning point to all other KickStartable projects [for me], as the writings also contain most of my project ideas, desires, and intentions. And so too would the the beautiful cycle of making could begin, thanks to beautiful tools, like KickStarter, and to beautiful people, like you. <em>Can’t we all just go back to doing what we each feel is natural and right? Living? Together?</em> [picture of the road to the sea] 8099 2018-12-18 13:28:48 2018-12-18 18:28:48 open closed proposal-for-the-mind-of-ra-the-wolf private 0 0 post 0 Uncategorized inline_featured_image 0 medium_post O:11:"Medium_Post":11:{s:16:"author_image_url";N;s:10:"author_url";N;s:11:"byline_name";N;s:12:"byline_email";N;s:10:"cross_link";s:2:"no";s:2:"id";N;s:21:"follower_notification";s:3:"yes";s:7:"license";s:19:"all-rights-reserved";s:14:"publication_id";s:12:"7a04709b0155";s:6:"status";s:6:"public";s:3:"url";N;} _wpcom_is_markdown 1 _edit_last 1 _yoast_wpseo_content_score 30 Excerpts for The Mind of Ra the Wolf http://rahilpatel.com/blog/excerpts-for-the-mind-of-ra-the-wolf Tue, 18 Dec 2018 19:17:19 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=8118 <h1>utopian culture</h1> <h2>sun-day</h2> Sunday, sun-day, sunny day is the day we live. Wake up naturally, to the sun; late, warm. Perhaps there’s still a giant to-do list on one’s mind; The sun slowly beats it out of you. Don’t fight it. Don’t take caffeine. Don’t take a shower. Bath in the sun. The world comes into view; The bees n’ butterflies. The weeds ‘n trees. The yards ‘n parks. Those past things to-do seem silly now. Now one just desires to take care of one’s abode: wash clothes, repair belongings, eat left-overs, wash one’s body (thoroughly!). If sun-day lasted any longer, one would begin to walk around one’s home, see the people nearby, take care of the surrounding areas, [naturally] creating new local projects. If it lasted even longer, those local projects would lead into more local interactions. And if it lasted long enough, those natural, frequent interactions would develop into care. Too bad everything currently goes against that [idea]: the system, traditions, education, artificial environments: the culture derived [from all of them]. <h2>Communal and Individual Living Spaces</h2> It seems the idea of coming from home, a home without rent especially, with a kitchen and warm shower, internet, a computer: everything necessary for homeostasis; then, going to a city, while maintaining that home seems to be a trend in my thoughts. It’s maintaining a sense of home, instead of just paying money to crash and eat wherever and whatever. It’s not communal. It’s independent. But, it provides security, enables one to follow one’s own natural timings, and, live quite productively, without the hassles and forces (often the desired organizations) of others. It enables one to live in one’s own natural accord, while being able to live anywhere, interacting with anyone, without relying on anyone else. Therefore, it follows the golden rule. Capitalism forces people to break the golden rule, relying on others, for food, drink, shelter, everything. A mobile home reduces most of the forces. One might not be able to grow food or catch water on their mobile home, but, with a filter and toaster or rice-cooker, it’s not bad. This sort of life isn’t as close to people as hostels, CouchSurfing, shared apartment, communes, or other shared living situations. It’s quite lonely really. Not communal. The forces of society are much lessened, and, therefore, for me, it’s extremely difficult to do. I nearly have to be forced by circumstance to take the route. Certain other personalities, often the hippie kinds are far better suited. I think it’s best to merely use the mobile home as a crash pad, as opposed to a communal space. The communal space is then seperated from the living space—well, at least the place where one sleeps and does their morning routine. I personally enjoy being in the communal space the entire time, even sleeping anywhere in it (I like having the sounds of people nearby), without need for personal space. I am able to get into a personal state of mind simply by focusing inwardly. My diet and living standards are neat and extremely simple. But, it seems, the living together in a commune is more difficult than imagined. Rent. Different life-styles: eating habits, cleaning habits, etc. It all gets in the way. So, we must seperate the two. Yet, families and shared apartments do it…so… it’s not impossible. Yeah, we really should be able to live together… <h2>outlines for building care</h2> some repeated thoughts: <h3>caring people are the most attractive</h3> Was it, the entire time (of my life? of at least Taiwan), that the main attractiveness of people and culture derived from a care for the environment [including people, animal, plants]? Was that what really led me from sub-urban VA to the rural and un-developed areas of Taiwan? Perhaps eventually to solitude? Is that what happened to Alex of Into The Wild? That as he became more educated, the amount of moral rules increased, caring more for everything, that, eventually, he trekked into solitude too? The anarchic communities I’ve lived in all have had a care to a certain degree, trying to care as much as it can for the time each individual has. But the cities only allow so much time. <h3>building care in others by being a model</h3> [Communes] and [those fiercely ideal people that organize them] are role models for society. They create events which involve living together: festivals. People camp for a few days, cook together, eat together, sleep together, clean together. By watching the elders cook and clean, the younger ones follow. But does it work? Some of the younger ones are influenced. The tourists who are there for a day, a certain performance, probably aren’t. Only the volunteers get the full experience and influence, and are probably already good, hence they volunteer. Thus, it doesn’t really work. It only affects volunteers, who are already smart. The others go un-influenced. What’s the point then? What’s the point of trying to educate others if others are too stupid, habituated, un-willing to learn, blind? Hope and optimism must exist to keep trying to educate. Pessimism results in completely detached hippies. What’s the point of living without that kind of hope? What does one do with their time? Consume drugs and media? That’s America. Anarchic communities are hopeful of social progress. Hippie communities are not, detached from society. Cities too, are hopeful. Sub-urbs are not. Hope is the driving motivation behind most living in cities and progressive communities. Without hope, the other areas continue with their same culture, ignorantly, un-conciously. Anarchic communities are cities, in the sense that they are the most progressive (diverse in mind) areas (in the world). More complex than cities and their institutions because they (Anarchic communities) are smaller in population, with more diverse individuals (and minds). Thus, anarchic communities are the greatest institutions, and therefore the best place to be in. But when they are separated from the city, the rural, everyone else, there is a severe lack of human connection, solidarity. The anarchic community is supposed to be a role community for the place it resides in, i.e. the city, town, country it is in. Thus, the anarchic community must have ties to other people: independent people, farmers, vegetarian restaurants, recycling aunties, and other good people. The network builds. The community grows. Until it takes over the area it resides in. That’s the revolution. A slow one. But what if the community that takes over has holes? Then, I guess, a more progressive anarchic community is created within it, and the process repeats. [todo: continue with caring labors, caring wage labors…] <h1>American culture</h1> <h2>What I usually mean by <em>fighting game</em> (a manifesto?)</h2> [this is part of another dreamy ideal KickStarter project proposal…about creating good fighting games!] For the core of the project, I usually mean a <em>video game</em> (Of course that would be a travesty to all of the other games: playground games, and real-time table-top games, other games that use electronic devices…) Ah yes, <em>real-time games</em>, not <em>turn-based games</em>. The action must keep going. Even speed chess might not cut it, as it’s still turn-based, just time-limited. When the player switches between offense and defense it can be seen as turn-based, but, the players on both sides are still continuously able to take actions, not just merely wait for their turn. Having defensive options makes a game much more compelling than merely two block options. Rolling, perfect-block / parry, spot-dodge, air-dodge, knock-down options were all key defense mechanics. But most key was DI: real-time defensive input. To limit the technical scope of the project, I usually mean <em>party game</em>: one screen, and one camera, usually restricted to one angle (because changing angle requires changing movement input), and at least two players. It’s also much more feasible to spectate one screen. Starcraft battles were masterful, but it really required an additional spectator screen to watch. A <em>sports game</em>, in that there is a way to win. It’s goal-oriented. This make it different from <em>contest games</em>, which require a human judge, such as a game-making contest, a combo contest, battle rap (a game of trash-talking?), or the community’s favorite: being the most stylish player. The goals shoudln’t stray away from fighting though, like moving a sports-ball into an area. [This important difference detailed later…] A <em>competitive game</em>, in that the better fighter,, will almost always win in a long match. Little to no randomness, especially for the main fighting calculations. (Example case of failure: Company of Heroes, potentially the one of the best RTS games.) [- What is a better fighter?: the person with better decision-making, experience, technical proficiency, ability to adapt, creativity, strategy…] A <em>fighting game</em>, in that it’s primarily consists of battle situations between players, continuous direct interaction. It’s distinctive from a <em>sports game</em> in that the objective is tightly-knit with the opponent; Think: The difference between Mario Kart versus mode and battle mode. Or, the difference between playing a game as intended, let’s say, cooperative games, and trying to destroy your friends without being destroyed—which is the un-written first principle rule of most fighting games: <strong><em>to hit your opponent without getting hit</em></strong>. It’s similarly distinctive from <em>battle game</em> too, in that the interaction with the opponent is more frequent. Tetris Battle and other ‘puzzle fighters’ aren’t [interactive] enough. Bomberman Battle, however, iirc, is. Thus, party battle games may be the best pop terms to describe the games I am going for, yet, the word fighting, seems edge out, as it tends to focus on the interaction, which often is fighting, regardless of whether it’s with arms or colorful turtle shells. Culturally, the word is pigeonholed to by extremely isolated past arcade communities to be a game that’s extremely similar to <em>Street Fighter 2</em>. So much so that the best and more technical fighting game<em>Melee</em>, was disregarded by them. No matter that the game actually consists entirely of punching and kicking opponents. But hopefully, instead of creating a new word, I’m keeping the word fighting games so that it can be rejuvenated and take on a much broader meaning, to include battle games, so that Mario Kart battle mode may be played alongside other fighters in the fighting game tournament scene. Those extremely narrow communities will have to adopt a new word: like, clone fighters, primitive fighters, or RPS games. [todo: read Wiki articles on games, fighting games, sports (sport games), competitive games, party games, etc.] <h3>Fighting Games and Sports Games</h3> It’s distinctive from a <em>sports game</em> in that the objective is tightly-knit with the opponent, not some sort of side-goal to score points. To understand this, think of the difference between Mario Kart in versus mode and in battle mode. Versus mode is mostly about racing, with little interaction with other racers; Battle mode is entirely about the interaction with other players, so much so, that <strong>every move that you make affects your chances to win.</strong> | Another example is the difference between non-video sports (football [soccer], basketball, hockey, rugby, etc.) and the mini-game of trying to take or keep a ball from your opponent. The rest of sports is about placing the ball in an area, requiring much team-work, planning, and practice. But, each time a sports player has the ball and makes it past a player, he wins a battle. That’s where all of the fighting occurs. It’s about the cross-over, juking, left or right, ball-handling, and, getting the steal. … <em>Battle sports games</em> seems vague, but usually, are just sports games, in that the objective is doing something else, other than beating your opponent. You <em>can</em> beat your opponent up as you try to do that something else, which is required to win, but, it’s just extra. In Team Fortress games, for example, the objective may be to capture a flag, push a cart, capture territories, or something, and, you can kill the opponents, you can make it your personal objective to have the most kills during that game, but, you or your team won’t be rewarded by the game for doing that. Turn Team Fortress into a death-match however, then, it becomes a fighting game. An aside: I vaguely remember a FPS battle tank game that my brother played for a short period of time when I was really young. That, I believe actually was a good example of a fighting FPS game. It had movement, aiming, other things, but in a really slow and strategic way. It’s probably why my brother really enjoyed GoldenEye and Halo with his friends much later on… In fact, now that I think of it, my brother solely played fighting games with his friends! The point is that the better <em>fighter</em> wins, not the better racer, or strategist (RTSs, a little vague…), team strategy (team games, including team sports games), map strategy (also little vague…). Maps and environments effect games, but, in the end, it the better fighter should still win, not some cheap map strategy, whether that’s a strategy to get a rocket launcher faster, or, counter-picking stages in more traditional fighters. <strong>Maps and environments often distract from fighting,</strong> hence why competitive players gravitate toward narrowing stage selection to basic environments: to help narrow the gameplay to the core of the game: fighting. RTSs also can distract from fighting. Fighting happens in battles. There’s strategies to battling, but, there’s also strategies for the whole resource-handling since of the game. Take that out, as it was for Company of Heroes, then, you get closer to a fighting game. So, to turn StarCraft into a fighting game, all you had to do was provide each player an army, then, see who was left standing. [todo: make this happen, or, re-visit an old map that does this well.] And, that’s actually what was nearly done, naturally, by the people. <strong>People made up rules</strong> where you weren’t allowed to rush (fight) for a certain initial amount of time. People went further and even made maps where you start with a bunch of resources, created buildings and armies instantaneously, then, after players were ready, fight. It wasn’t very professional, but, it got to the point quick: fighting. One army vs the other. 200 units of army. Or, even constant building and fighting. It was childish fighting at its best. It’s a clear demonstration of <strong>people naturally modifying a game to become a fighting game</strong>. It’s a phenomenon that happens all of the time. You and your friend are playing a cooperative game. Turn friendly fire on. It’ll quickly turn into a fighting game. You and your friends are playing ‘ball, suddenly, there’s bout, it’s settled in a 1v1, first to 21 points, or, whatever. It’s just natural, instinctive, competitive. Actually punching your friend’s face in, is something different, certainly not part of <em>the game</em>. <h2>more thoughts on <em>Wolf Children</em></h2> I slept early, woke up in the middle of the night, and turned on Wolf Children, starting it about half-way in, about when the mother is talking to her neighbors about sending their kids to pre-school and commuting to work. I ended up watching until the end. Animated films can pack so many ideas, ideals, and symbols, resulting in infinite meanings and interpretations. That is the power of animated films, or, perhaps, fiction, above non-fiction. A documentary can show reality, and one can try to interpret the reasons behind the actions of people, but fiction can show an entire life in five minutes, causing the mind make sense of it all. Again, just as watching Lost Voices of Children [title?], the home, including the kitchen, is entirely natural: wooden utensils, clay [?] dishes and bowls, the iconic giant metal tea-pot (like the one from Place of Arts), a metal pot with a wooden handle (like the one my mom uses to make chai in). The kitchen’s table-top has broken tiles, and it’s beautiful. In another scene, where the mother is storing all of the vegetables she obtained by trading her potatoes with other farmers in her fridge, there’s a rattan basket (identical to the one I bought at Place of Arts) with what looks like Chinese spring onion (蔥), on the floor are huge radishes, cabbages, several cartons of eggs, and two bags of rice with the Chinese character 米 on it. In a later scene, there is a hanging cabinet with glass jars full of colorful shapes, two wooden basket steamers, two clay urns, several metal pots including the ufo shaped one that was in the sink in that other scene, a wooden compartmentalized basket steamer, larger glass jars above, a spice cabinet, the iconic metal teapot on the burner, a metal steamer with a wooden lid on an electric water steaming device, pots, ladles, and an electric heater connected to the sink faucets. It is an ideal kitchen. There is much thought put into every bit of it, much like the film. — Like the east coast of Taiwan, the west (Sea of Japan) coast of Japan is desolate, with sparingly few farmers because typhoons hit often. She lives deepest in the mountain, compared to her neighbors, perhaps lessening the damage, as her home (and land) is surrounded by trees and mountains. Her farm (or what I’m guessing was) now has plants with trellises and sticks for support and a green-house like cylinder covering two rows. — Ame’s education is also an ideal. Home-schooled until first-grade and supervised by his mother afterwards. The mother notices his interest in a nature conservationist part-time job ad on a bulletin board, so she takes him there, allowing him to follow his interests as early as first grade, and, by third grade, he stops attending school, appearing really uninterested from the beginning to end. Ame “goes in an out” of the home on his own accord. It’s quite a natural pace to watch, but eerie, as he is so detached from his immediate surroundings. In one scene, while the mother prepares the house for the typhoon, Ame is, as usual, detached from the activity, thinking about all of the animals that need care during the typhoon. The mother’s world is the house and nearby land, but Ame’s world is the mountainous area, and even Yuki’s world are her schools. Their goals are to take care of their worlds, and that is what occupies their minds, most of the time. We create social relations, and if they are strong, we desire to take care of them. At different times in my life, I’ve wanted to take care of the world, less fortunate people of cities in America, less fortunate people in Asia, my neighborhood in Taipei, Taiwan, and perhaps soon, the east coast of Taiwan. It’s a natural desire: care. But the scope of that desire depends on the individual. Some people care for themselves, their family, their neighborhood, their city, their country, or some other form of community: migrant communities, anarchic communities, art communities, educational institutions, environmental communities. Depending on the strength of my social connections at the time, my care for each fluctuated. As my interests changed, so did the communities I spent time with, from art-consuming to art-making to travel to philosophy to environment. I cared for, and desired to care for each community I’ve lived in. [todo: continue, very important] Is it wrong to leave a community, to break social connections, to lose care? Shouldn’t one ideally stay in the same community, pursuing one’s interests independently, within it? It is difficult to be so independent, working in solitude. Though ideal to stay and help one’s original community, the community can be so far from one’s ideal that it may be impossible to alter it [enough]. An art community in a contemporary American city is very different from an art community in the nature of Taiwan’s east coast. There are differences in the physical environment and the culture of the people that reside in it. The differences in culture are so great, that it may indeed be impossible to alter the culture of one’s original community [to the extent of one’s desires]. In such a case, it may be justifiable to leave it. It even seems that any developed society’s culture has gone so far in the wrong directions that there is no way to reduce their cultural problems, and the only solution is to leave it. I care for people, humans. I care for Americans, but, I feel better caring for a culture that I care about. Simpler cultures, such that of developing countries: farmers, family-run restaurants and food vendors, people who take care of nature, people who do things to allow humans to survive; are people I care about most. Thus, that is the community I’ve slowly gravitated toward, and, therefore, the world that I desire to take care of. [todo: ? caring for a small community (tiny art community, family, single building, house) vs a large community (farm towns)] <h2>keepin’ it real / bein’ real / what is real? (in black media culture)</h2> More day-dreams. I mean, what else is there to do when your body is en-slaved? [The day-dream was removed] Rap can be used as a tool to not only teach the next generations how to hustle or stay alive, but, to criticize anyone and anything that isn’t real. <strong>It’s the perfect platform for real people.</strong> That is, anarchists. Brag about how stupid others are and how much smarter you are? Criticize others rappers. Make it competitive. The goal, however, should be to add anarchy knowledge into the songs, along with somehow making good songs. It should feel good singing it, bringing about an anarchic, antagonistic feeling. It’s political rap. It’s critical rap. It’s negative. Yet, I do need to consider the viewpoint of an institutionalized zombie. Comedy, a la Chapelle, can also be used as a tool to educate and criticize. As exemplified by the Chapelle Show, it brought all of the social problems of America to the front. It’s another <strong>way to sneak in good material into media, real material, without dealing with the institutionalized wealthy</strong> owners of television. Comedy, just as Jon Stewat proved too, between South Park and the Chapelle Show, was a way to disseminate real knowledge and information through the medium of comedy, <strong>in a subversive way</strong>, without being in the attention or at fault for criticism, using satire as the ‘scape goat. So, just like rap, I can use comedy to diffuse my own ideas. Both are particularly good for my personality too, just working out ideas and concepts, then talking them out, through rap songs and comedy routines. They are dense forms of media. Like essays, rap songs and comedy routines may include many ideas and the development of those ideas, just, condensed into certain art forms. The word-smithing of rap lyrics. The spoken word-eque speech and gestures of comedy bits. <strong>The arts make the ideas stick. Stick in a way the public will remember, replay, and re-remember.</strong> That is the crucial pro of these <strong>oral art forms</strong>. Books are much harder to remember for humans. The experience isn’t catchy. It’s not fit to a beat, or a song. <strong>Real knowledge need to fit to daily-consumable ways.</strong> Lectures are a step up from books, yet, even that may not be enough. <strong>Songs and comedy bits, just a few sentences, just a few words, can really stick, can really affect change, alter decisions.</strong> Memorable tunes and lines such as “Life’s a bitch, and then ya’ die.” and “Cash rules everything around me.” become life’s anthems, used as vernacular, meme, and labor-song. Memorable bits such as police sprinkling crack on dead victims of those police, claiming non-black people into black culture, and impersonations of institutionalized white people bring clarity to the differences of cultures: real and institutionalized, institutionalized police and black cultures, hippie pot-smoking white cultures and black culture, etc. <strong>All of them containing very real knowledge… Knowledge that comes so easily that we take it for granted. Yet, it’s the art of creating the rap songs and comedy bits that enable the dissemination of the knowledge.</strong> Black culture, particularly <strong>black entertainment culture, or, black media culture, consits of a canon of these works.</strong> Examples: Chapelle Show, stand-up comedian routines, singers, rappers, television shows such as Martin and The Fresh Prince…, rap videos, and so on. Somehow, from this media, a culture within a culture is created. It’s not black culture, though, all of them contain it. It’s just a series of works by people of black culture, experienced by those who live in cultures that consume black media. Which is, much of America, especially, suburban and perhaps rural Americans, where the media is most powerfully disseminated [and consumed]. This common set of works consumed by everyone for a certain period of time allows for people to use them as references and metaphors for concepts for casual conversation, every-day conversation even. It builds up, with more references and more concepts. It’s the way we talk in suburban America. Perhaps some time in the past people consumed books and used them for references—literary culture. Instead of pointing to the bureaucratic skit by Chapelle, people would point to Kafka. After books, there were comic books [still are for Japan and East Asia]. Original concepts and past concepts from literature were embossed into comic books: comic book culture. Again, for film culture. Again, for game culture. Now, all of them combined. Somehow, people not only communicate using these media cultures, but create a world-view with them. <strong>The mind consumes it all and puts together a imagined world.</strong> <strong>Black culture though, unlike much of the creations of the institutionalized West</strong>,—such as Hollywood, music companies, television networks, and other owners of popularly-disseminated media—for the most part, <strong>kept it real.</strong> <strong>’White people’ working in those places produced anything for money. It didn’t matter how fake or useless it was.</strong> Black people working in those places, found ways to keep it real; Two path-ways I previously mentioned: rap music and comedy. Others may include ‘hood’ movies such as Friday, where people actually act very similarly as they would in reality, not too dramatic or far-fetched; spoken word; hip-hop (other than rap); ‘sit-coms’ and so on [todo: hmm, what else?]. <strong>Seemingly distractions, black media has been passing down gems like oral folk songs.</strong> The people catch the right ideas from the mess, and laugh at the rest, joyously. <strong>It’s a contemporary tradition.</strong> A tradition <strong>not only limited to black Americans but to most of Americans, and, even people around the world.</strong> I’ve experienced people in other countries, especially the minority communities, latch on to black media: aboriginals in Taiwan being dark themselves and treated very un-equally by the country’s institutions; More hip, real, people from Korea and Japan, usually in a more counter-cultural way; The relaxed, real people of the Netherlands; The cooler people of other European countries; Those into other real communities such as anarchists, fighting game cultures, sports cultures, and so on. All of them find something in black media culture that they get, just get. <strong>What they get from black media</strong> can vary: It can be the sensual pleasures (drinks, clubs, sex, fashion, etc.), being cool (just chill, smoking, etc.), fighting (males bragging and flexing), sitting at home and consuming media and loathing work…but, I believe the main component <strong>is being real.</strong> <strong>But what is <em>‘being real’</em>?</strong> Well, it’s not institutionalized (white) people most easily recognized by Chapelle’s impersonations. It’s not office work. It’s more of a neighborhood feel. Being at home. Cooking. Neighborhood life. Cook-outs. House-parties. If there’s any work shown, it’s work on the house, or caring for the community, or even for the garden. It’s not corporate work. It’s real work. The work that the people can see from their neighborhood: post office workers, delivery workers, truckers, Wal-marts, convenient stores. It’s not: financial institutions, educational institutions (except local school systems), corporate institutions, government institutions (unless in order to help real people problems), medical institutions (unless it’s helping people real people problems). <strong>Basically, it’s being rational, rational in a way that’s in tune with reality, in tune with the rhythms of life, in tune with what people are thinking and feeling, in solidarity with the culture; Pragmatic; Following common sense. Institutions often are some form of irrationality, based on traditions that make no sense, isolated from the reality of communities of people, progenated away from reality and implemented at a distance instrumentally.</strong> As the world alters its own original cultures to shape-shift into something similar to America, fake media is endlessly emulated and reproduced in different languages and fit to different cultures, like Bollywood, but, in every country. Within these places, not a single ounce of realness exists. All heartless money-hoarders following equally heartless money-hoarders, like Chinese versions. Black culture is America’s most prominent real <strong>ethnic culture</strong>, among many others, such as Spanish and Filipino cultures. For the rest of the world, there too are many communities of people that maintain raalness: the aboriginals of Taiwan, the migrant workers of nearly any country (in the case of Taiwan: Indonesians and Vietnamese), minority groups[,] especially those that tend to stray away from institutionalized societies (‘Zomia’), artist communities, outcast (hippies, anarchists, etc.) communities, etc. <strong>As the institutions degenerate and reproduce degenerate human societies, the real peoples of the world try to maintain realness by ‘keeping it real’ and remembering to do so with canonized <em>real arts</em> such rap hooks and comedy sketches.</strong> <em><em>The results of doing so: Real dialiects are preserved</em><em>: dialects of the American South, or even dialects of aboriginal peoples in other countries, staving off the fake TV news reporter dialects of the institutionalized mass education systems [a popular dispute within public schools in black cultured areas]. </em><em>Real behaviors are preserved</em></em>: instead of walking around up-right as if one had a butt-plug inserted, people walk around quite casually, perhaps even with some swag or a natural stride, riding a BMX bike or long-board for commutes; Instead of faking being nice, faking smiles, faking ‘yes’s’, being flaky, <strong>people are more direct and truthful</strong>. [todo: really worth thinking of more positive results] Most importantly though, <strong>real people are preserved.</strong> <strong>It’s through the consumption or experience of interacting with <em>real people</em> that we maintain a genuine identity of ourselves.</strong> If it weren’t for real people and the real arts (and media) that they created, the world may have become filled with fake people, robots, as East Asia (Japan, Korea, China) is now: Places where institutionalization consumes the entire day from the near 12-hour mass “education” (brain-wash) which begins at a very young age, to the near 10-hour mass “employment” (excess wage labour”)…[todo: can write some more here…] Though I believe that some personalities are more resistant to institutionalization (or just brain-wash in general), especially the dreamers (INFP) and myself (INTP), <strong>we are a minority fighting against a majority of more easily malleable slates.</strong> So, we need all of the tools we can use to make up for that, and, <em>real media</em> is one such tool. Making real media to maintain real cultures, whether it’s Black American culture, anarchist culture, punk culture, Taiwanese aboriginal culture, certain lower-class suburban neighborhoods, or the ghettos of the world, it doesn’t matter. What matters is that the trait of realness is within in the culture, that somewhere in the ethics of life people are acting genuinely, <em>normal</em>, <em>naturally</em>. <strong>Making <em>real arts</em> about the ethics of <em>real people</em>.</strong> That’s one way to combat the institutions. Documenting real people (art communities, ethnic enclaves and cultures, outcast communities, that film about scavengers). ‘Hood-like films, such as <em>La Haine</em>. Comedy routines using local dialects. Locally-flavored video games like that one created for <em>Das Racist</em>? Zines written in a casual tone. Stories told and documented through rap verses. Locally-flavored anything: comic-books, photo essays, open-mics performances. <strong><em>Local arts.</em></strong> <em>La Haine</em> was one of my early favorite films. It being a cool, gritty, educational, anti-gangster gangster film perked the normative interests of my male-side, yet, it has many deep realities to it: going from suburban ‘projects’ to city urban planning; <em><em>everything from the point-of-view of real people</em></em>: institutionalized arts, police, malls, the ‘hood, and so on. It begins in a real place (the projects: banleaui[spelling?]) [with real people] and ends in a fake place (the city: Paris) [with fake people]. <strong>From this point of view it’s all so clear.</strong> From any other point of view though, it may not be so obvious, as Hollywood has proved: Sure, it’s clear to real people that any Hollywood movie, or any <strong><em>non-real art</em>, is just senseless, institutional ideas thrown together</strong> [as pointed out and then obscured by Zizek], but, for many, I believe, that is not the case. So, <strong>keeping a <em>real point-of-view</em> is pivotal</strong>, I mean, without that, what is there really? Just <strong>non-sensical ideas and traditions through history thrown together, much like reality.</strong> How do you capture the real? <strong>What is the real?</strong> Is it natural? Un-tampered natural behaviors? <strong>How do you capture the real?</strong> Video? Audio recording? <strong>What the difference between those [documentary] mediums and arts such as poetry (rap and spoken word) prose (comedy)?</strong> Condensation. Rap and spoken word break realities down to concepts and conceptual metaphors. It’s condensed and dense. Instead of a huge biography of a person who dies, a person may just be given one line. Isn’t the reality, then, lost? Yes. Yes, it is. That’s why documentaries are much closer to reality, even can be used as reference. <strong>Video documentaries are a mirror of life. Most other arts are full of artifacts.</strong> <strong>Then, doesn’t it just make sense to document reality?</strong> Me in an extremely real state-of-mind would agree with this rationality. <strong>It’s only through documentarians [and reality] that knowledge, especially of humans, can be derived.</strong> Look at the world as Chris Marker’s camera strolls through it. Let Chris’s narration guide the mind, but, <strong>it’s up to one’s own mind to really learn anything from it</strong>. The other arts, especially language, are so far from reality. Hmmm… But doesn’t Kendrick count? There’s so many ideas and <em>feelings</em> behind it. <em><em>The feelings and passion behind spoken word and music is…</em></em>something. “These Walls” has many ideas, and GKMC has many stories, but, there’s so much feeling on most of the tracks from TPAB. It’s <strong>raw passion, coming solely from the voice</strong>. That expression is quite different from video. Acting can show that kind of passion. As can dancing. But just documentary style video…is different. <strong>In documentary style videos the real expressions of people are shown by the every-day actions of people. In many other arts, let’s say <em>expressive arts</em>, the expressions are expressed toward the medium in a more direct manner.</strong> [It’s not real…as in, no one normally bursts out rapping “DNA”, but, the feelings and sentiments are true.] <strong>The artist’s feelings are directly conveyed. It’s a very dense expression of that conveyance.</strong> It’s about the artist’s feelings. <strong>Documentary video is less egotistic, requiring far more attention and focus to really learn about reality [and how it works]. It can be an emotional experience, but not so directly from the artist, rather, from the realities of the world.</strong> Watching chickens get crushed in Food Inc. is an emotional experience, but, it’s not directly expressed by the directory doing it: reality does it. …So then, how does Kendrick fit my whole idea of keeping it real? How does Kendrick, by making rap, help keep and even make society behave more real? Well, he threw out political correctness immediately. ‘PC’ is the opposite of real [todo: another essay]. <strong>He just makes the right judgements.</strong> <strong>He says what black is by expressing what black feels like by expressing how he felt [in several instances] in his past.</strong> <strong>And in doing so, by admitting his feelings, ‘putting it into wax’, he keeps it real.</strong> The feelings he felt are felt by many others. It resonates. <strong>Instead of conforming to institutions, he preserves black culture, for himself, and in doing so, for everyone.</strong> <strong>Simply admitting feelings, antagonisms, what one feels is wrong, what one feels passionate or emotional about, are ways of keeping it real.</strong> [todo: make arts using this as the premise!!!] Just tell the truth. Be truthful about one’s own feelings. Put it into art. That’s enough. [todo: make a TPAB-like passionate album about the antagonisms of institutions] <h1>philosophy culture</h1> <h2>expressive and rational modes of life</h2> Ahhhh…Having a home…a comfortable home…is great.—But, is it really just the air condititions?, humidity and temperature, that make it comfortable? Is that it? When I’m cold, I must keep drinking hot water or a hot caffeinated drink to have energy, which leads to, often, writing, because it’s the quickest way, and, with the caffeine, I’m able. When I’m hot, I must keep moving, wandering, drinking ice-cold tea, staying alive, talking, expressing myself, libido high, need sex, need someone to actively have sex with me, need to keep interacting, with people and the world. But when I’m comfortable…I’m dead. Hollow. Is this really the beginning of instrumental rationality, as opposed to constant thinking / living in the moment / conscious and attentive of what’s around? <em>Instrumentally rational cultures</em> — Jews and Jew-likes — vs <em>expressive cultures</em> — Black Americans and Gypsy-likes? During the <em>expressive mode of life</em>, one has to wade through capitalism, ‘huckin’ and jivin’, trying to ‘stay alive’ while living through performance. Black entertainment. Gypsy music and dance. Busking. Art-ing. Art-life. <strong>We have to constantly express ourselves, yet, find a ways to live whilst doing it.</strong> It’s a difficult life. Capitalism doesn’t match. Neither do heart-less people. Performance spaces and good public spaces are needed to keep such people healthy. The culture has nourish them… During the <em>instrumentally rational mode of life</em>, one’s end-goal is capital, and thus world-views are shifted by the lens of capital. Ignorant of the damaging means. Often, under capitalism and freedom, one goes in and out of both modes, or, even tries mixing them. ‘Commercial art’. Or even just genuine art that is objectively capitalistic (trying to gain more capital) without much conscious of it. <strong>We live, we express, but often, those things can get mixed up with capital.</strong> <em>It happens. It just happens.</em> <strong>To live genuinely is to constantly express one’s true intentions, through communication or action.</strong> Always doing what’s on one’s mind (unless, that mind is corrupted…). <strong>This state of mind is true life.</strong> <strong>Capitalism disables us</strong> acting in such a way, and, in some places, even communicating in such a way. One can’t do what one wants due to laws, institutions, and, mostly, lack of money. Thankfully, the mind keeps going, free. Until they get that 1984 tech to read minds. Although capitalism disables us from, perhaps, certain forms of hedonism that requires capital, it can’t stop us from expressing ourselves in the most basic human ways: language, song, dance, performance. <strong>We write, we sing, we dance, we live, by expressing ourselves; All of that, without capital.</strong> <strong>Human expression requires so little: time, good health. The rest is up to us.</strong> <h2>thoughts on crowd-funding with Yuval</h2> [The Sugar Daddies of Science] Science, as a giant system, needs a lot of money, but individuals doing research experiments that don’t require much money don’t. And, with a little DIY could accomplish a lot. All of that, self-funded, just as any other artist is, by doing whatever work for money. Yeah, science groups, like the academy of sciences or whatever, are / were linked to politics, but surely a ton of independent thinkers existed. Science, to Yuval, is limited to the institutionalized-complex: academia, research centers, military research, etc. Or, during the time of the explorers, expeditions funded by European governments. The independent explorers are skipped over by historians, as are billions of artists. <strong>Now, with crowd-funding, does it matter so much? Crowd-funding shifts the financial aqueducts, from the old route of government to people, to the new route of people to people. Basically, crowds are the new financial foundation.</strong> Furthermore, <strong>crowds, unlike states, are way more likely to fund projects that have no political or economic value, such as, arts.</strong> His example of two scientists with cow-related projects is great. Quite a bit of time of my life was wasted because I simply thought there would be someone, whether a foundation created by a person that seemed sane, NGOs, and even at two points in my life, academia, that might be sane enough to fund my dreams. Most of that time was wasted. What I got out of it was the writings of my dreams, in a form guided by grant guidelines. The only one that agreed was one who just wanted more of my money!—the top art school. <strong>There is no hope in any of those foundations. They are all ancient.</strong> <strong>All of the hope, I believe, relies on crowd-funded, friend-group-funded (which is precisely where crowd-funding get its initial kick of funding), and personally-funded endevours.</strong> Most works are personally-funded. The old foundations should rightfully die and make way for the far more accurate, quantifiable crowd-funding. The old foundation-grantee system was rather random: Rich people created a foundation. Someone in it somehow chooses the projects. That’s where the money goes. <strong>It all depended on the ideology of the people who have a say in where the money goes.</strong> <strong>Now, as long as there are people out there with similar values willing to donate money to a project, it’s possible the project will be funded.</strong> <strong>Which means, just about any sort of project has the possibly to get funded.</strong> This is the current digital foundation. Just as digital market-places disrupted traditional, physical markets, so too do digital foundations. Why check the physical markets when you can check the world on eBay, or the world-store on Amazon? Well, there are physical reasons, but, otherwise, just order online! Similarly, why check old foundations when you can try crowd-funding? “Angel investing” in Silicon Valley was quite a disruption too, even before crowd-funding really took off. Here, a bunch of rich technocrats directly invested in more technology. And so the feedback loop becomes: invest in technology, get money, invest… Even more simple than the science loop! As long as it gets money, the investors are happy. <strong>There are no morals in Silicon Valley.</strong> Hence, dreadful “games”, dreadful apps, and other dreadful technologies, such as those of the most dreadful Elon Musk. <strong>Moral-less people just chasing money, destroying nature, taking advantage of the frail human psyche in every way possible to get more money, quantifying everything evermore.</strong> At least with science there was a check. In addition to getting money (economy), it often had a political interest. Funding war machines, sure, but also the rest of government functions, including health and security. With direct investors, there’s no check. It doesn’t have to do anything, except, make money! <strong>Crowd-funding is almost the opposite of direct investment. The crowd doesn’t get anything in return (save “rewards”). It’s not a investment, as in a stake of the project. It’s just money flowing into whatever people value. And that’s beautiful! That’s the ideal! Put your money exactly into the projects that you value, <em>directly</em>!</strong> It may be one of the best inventions ever! Or worst. Like Silicon Valley, the values of the funders still suck. Silicon Valley investors value money. If they value anything else, it comes <em>after</em> money. <strong>The crowd’s, that is, the public’s values, though much better, really depends on their interests [at that moment]. And their interests depends on their culture. And that culture is American culture [at that moment]</strong>, since America has the most people and most money using crowd-funding. American culture is simultaneously beautiful and scary. It could potentially fund and over-fund anything, but most of the time, it’s quite predictable. Things that Americans love, such as an entertainment media—an old favorite film, game, toy, sci-fi book, etc.—will ensure that the makers’ new project will be funded. So, one has to play the popular game. Fund a new Goonies movie? Or anything from Nickelodeon? Sure, a million [dollars]. Fund a fine artist or social theorist? Far less people, if any. A lot of it has to do with what’s on the mind of Americans at the moment (celebrities, Black American movement…) and marketing tactics. Nostalgia is easy bait. 90s anything. Thats prime traditional media turned internet generation—the generation that likely most used crowd-funding. Otherwise, <strong>it’s usually just sheer consumerism interests.</strong> Moral projects are quite rare and receive far less than entertainment projects. <strong>Moral projects are also extremely unevenly distributed [(I mean, it has to be. Not everyone is making crowd-funding projects for every project that they do)].</strong> So, is it really better than the old foundations? Hmmmm. Now, I’m not so sure. Foundations are just old-thinking, but at least there were some quality assurance, good intentions, and guidelines in mind for each foundation, at times making decent choices. Crowd-funding is pop-thinking, and the American crowd is much more consumerist than moralist. The result is probably wild, with both the good and the bad, no filter. <strong>It’s capitalism, no filter.</strong> Hmm. It really depends on Americans’ culture, education, and attention span. That’s so scary. <strong>It seems Plato’s problem still exists here: there has never been a philosopher in control. In this case, of where the money goes.</strong> <strong>And so, we’ve gone through 2000 or so years just to reach the same societal problem: the idiots are in control of society.</strong> Ugh. 8118 2018-12-18 14:17:19 2018-12-18 19:17:19 open closed excerpts-for-the-mind-of-ra-the-wolf private 0 0 post 0 Uncategorized inline_featured_image 0 medium_post O:11:"Medium_Post":11:{s:16:"author_image_url";N;s:10:"author_url";N;s:11:"byline_name";N;s:12:"byline_email";N;s:10:"cross_link";s:2:"no";s:2:"id";N;s:21:"follower_notification";s:3:"yes";s:7:"license";s:19:"all-rights-reserved";s:14:"publication_id";s:12:"7a04709b0155";s:6:"status";s:6:"public";s:3:"url";N;} _wpcom_is_markdown 1 _edit_last 1 _yoast_wpseo_content_score 30 Save your Netflix ratings http://rahilpatel.com/blog/save-your-netflix-ratings Sat, 11 Dec 2010 22:22:51 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=1 I have a data whoring personality.

 Previously, to download my Netflix Ratings I used to use a <a title="script" href="http://tenhanna.com/greasemonkey/" target="_self">script</a> in Greasemonkey, but that didn't work this time. After some Googling, I found <a title="LikeMinds" href="http://www.likeminds.com/" target="_self">LikeMinds</a> (SaveMyRatings).

 There were some errors. Some foreign movie titles contained weird characters. I even found a movie I can't find on Netflix--"Wild, Wild West: The Steel Assassin" from 1999! Regardless, my storage greedy personality was satisifed.
 
 I went even further adding friends similar to me, which resulted with a list of "movies new to you that your 19 LikeMinds rated highly".

I normally fall asleep on documentaries. To keep me awake, the documentary has to be more than a typical documentary that provides knowledge about a subject. It has to have some movie elements to keep it compelling throughout, like the thrill of “Man on Wire” or the cinematography of “Food Inc.”. Gladly it was more.
 
 I’m interested in all types of art and media: films, comics, fashion, whatever. As long as it seems like the creator tried to create something original, I’m happy to observe. Street Art is no different. I’ve only glimpsed at some popular street art on the internet. I can’t recall exactly how, but a likely example would be: a friend instant messages me <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuGaqLT-gO4">a stop motion animated film by blu</a>, then I Wikipedia him, which leads to more Wikipedia articles, and eventually I find Banksy and Shepard Fairy, among others.
 
 It did well on metacritic, Ebert liked it (my ratings are similar to his), and the Netflix summary on the DVD case cover was very appealing to me.
 
 “<em>Filmmaker Thierry Guetta had been casually documenting the underground world of street art for years, but when he encounters Banksy, an elusive British stencil artist, his project takes a fascinating twist. Unimpressed with Guetta's footage, Banksy takes over filmmaking duties and Guetta reinvents himself as a street artist named Mr. Brainwash -- and, much to Banksy's surprise, immediately becomes a darling of the Los Angeles art scene.</em><em>”</em>
 
 On to the movie…
 
 The movie itself is very good. The main character felt real, background knowledge about modern street art is given, questions are asked.
 
 The main character, Thierry Guetta, is a French guy who has, since childhood, filmed—err video recording—everything in life. When he starts taping his street artist cousin, Invader, he really gets into it. He goes out at night on rooftops to record Invader, and soon more famous people, notably, Banksy.
 
 Banksy is a modern famous street artist, possibly helped by the anonymity of himself, but still a legit artist. When it comes time for Thierry to create a film out of the hundreds of unlabeled tapes in storage, he fails. The film stinks, because Thierry is not a filmmaker, nor an artist. Banksy takes over, creating the film being watched, while Thierry goes on to make his own art.
 
 Thierry goes on to create a showcase similar to the one he recorded for Banksy. He hires a ton of people, morally good, hard-working people. Emulating the styles of the artists he recorded, his showcase becomes a media sensation, making him a celebrity. He goes on to sell his work, auctioning pieces off at lucrative prices.
 
 It’s paining to any artist, or anyone who even appreciates art, that a person could use hype and copy popularized styles to make millions of dollars. It’s especially paining to Banksy, as it seems it is the main motive he made the film. I’ve personally seen this happen in every medium. Listen to the radio, watch a mainstream movie, I feel the pain too.
 
 The main thing here is that Thierry is a genuinely flawed person. He’s not smart (I believe one person called him retarded). He’s not artistic. He’s just ambitious. With sheer ambition he is able to become famous, using accomplices better than himself.
 
 He is shown to have ADD, not being able to focus, not even capable of creating a single art piece. Throughout the movie it is his hired assistants that do the work for him. In one of the extras, where he was to create one piece for a multi-artist exhibition, he asked for help, getting frustrated after trying for less than 30 seconds.
 
 There are many lines spoken by Guetta, through his clumsy English, that strengthen the character. Simultaneously there are many lines said by Banksy, which question what art is. Sure, Guetta deliberately copied the people whom he videotaped, becoming an overnight celebrity with a piece as simple as a pop culture image with a mustache…but this shows how small the difference can be between art and a joke.
 
 After watching the movie, I watched what I guessed are the two shorter extras [I’ll watch the other two tomorrow]. Then, I read the Wikipedia articles on the movie, Banksy, and Thierry Guetta. Before this, I didn’t know it was actually directed by Banksy! I then read that people and critics speculate the authenticity of the film. That the entire film was a hoax. Banksy created the character.
 
 I recalled the movie in my head, questioning how plausible the main character was. I watch all serious films alone, taking it all in at once. I don’t think about plot holes, or question character’s motives, I just absorb it all feebly...but as I recalled the main character and the plausibility of the plot, it was quite ridiculous. A dimwitted nobody becomes an overnight celebrity?  Yet, the film was so good, that Thierry felt real.
 
 The entire movie does fit into a hoax though. Banksy could’ve created this inferior artist, and the art behind it, and even display it in the public. The character’s name IS Mr. Brainwash… Still, I feel the character is too good to create. Maybe this guy, Thierry, is real. Then Banksy met him, took some of his old tapings of family events, and created the rest.
 
 The film itself is great, and the thought that the entire thing may be a hoax makes it even greater. Banksy remains unidentified. The credited director is simply, “Banksy”. His elusiveness intrigues me, as does his art. 30 2011-01-02 01:33:46 2011-01-02 06:33:46 open open exit-through-the-gift-shop publish 0 0 post 0 art artist Banksy documentary Fairey Film Reviews Films grafitti Guetta Invader MBW Mr. Brainwash Shepard street Thierry _edit_last 1 _wp_old_slug Why have a personal blog? http://rahilpatel.com/blog/why-have-a-personal-blog Sun, 02 Jan 2011 11:33:22 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=38 I just needed to write. Anyone can write a book. Maybe there’s some skills involved, like fitting wordplay and rhymes into a song's harmony…I just had to make sure I can write.
 
 I don’t know what my next career is, or what I’m going to do when I get to San Francisco, but it probably involves writing. I could be writing scripts, making critiques, or documenting source code. It’s a skill that needs improving, and lasts forever.
 
 A friend once started blogging. He said the reason he started was so he could write. He blogged for the sake of writing. It doesn’t matter who read it. He wrote his thoughts, observations, and published it on the internet.
 
 Maybe my INTJ personality is good at writing. I can’t draw but I sure can place my thoughts onto paper, placing forth my judgement and personal observations.
 
 Ugh, but non-fiction is boring. I hope I can write something cool, like an Alan Moore script! 38 2011-01-02 06:33:22 2011-01-02 11:33:22 open open why-have-a-personal-blog publish 0 0 post 0 Art Literature Personal _edit_last 1 _wp_old_slug A Thought about Creative Careers and the Influence of Money http://rahilpatel.com/blog/a-thought-about-creative-careers-and-the-influence-of-money Thu, 26 May 2011 04:52:53 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=123 Figured I should post something as I will be job hunting soon and my website is listed in my resume!
 
 Like any techie, this domain is reserved for my personal use. Of course I wanted to design a cool website for myself but it just isn't a priority. Which leads to what's currently on my mind.
 
 I had a thought about me trying to explain why there is such a small amount of creative companies that I'd want to work for. It started with an example and went from there.
 
 Dreamworks is making Shrek X because upper management know it will make money no matter what the quality of the end result is. The original Shrek was a huge success, so marketing capitalized on it and turned it into a franchise. This limits the creativity of the team, probably forcing the auteur to quit because of it. Upper management probably makes rough deadlines--one Shrek movie per year. The company is now crap. Just like that.
 
 Well okay, Kung Fu Panda 2 seemed to fare well with the critics. I haven't seen it.
 
 Anyhow, this deterioration occurs to companies in every creative/entertainment industry. The music used in Shrek X are from popular artists because the public can recognize it, resulting in a more accessible product that is easier to market. Shrek X the video game is handed off to some game studio, restricting creativity, limiting quality due to a short deadline, resulting in more crap.
 
 Only a handful of quality companies become large and successful companies--Pixar, Apple, Blizzard. So that leaves a few large companies and striving independent studios that favor quality over money.
 
 I want to find a job within one of these companies, make a steady paycheck in a stress free work environment where I can cherish my work, 'cause working hard for something I'm not proud of is dissatisfying. After securing a job, I could then use my free time to work on other aspirations--music and film--to make something of my own. Possibly create my own company, or with friends. Personally invest in myself, or pray for an angel investor. Is this the only path in such a money-whoring world? Maybe I should just forget money completely. Become a traveling artist, a bum in most's eyes. Oh right, then I can't support a family. Hmm... Yup, that's the only path I can currently think of. The only path without selling my soul. 123 2011-05-26 00:52:53 2011-05-26 04:52:53 open open a-thought-about-creative-careers-and-the-influence-of-money publish 0 0 post 0 artist bum entertainment independent indie industry job mainstream Personal _edit_last 1 Overcoming the Internal Conflicts of an Artist http://rahilpatel.com/blog/overcoming-the-internal-conflicts-of-an-artist Fri, 03 Jun 2011 21:21:40 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=142 These are the same universal conflicts conveyed in mainstream film cliches, advertisements, and other media.
 
 The way people, or at least an artist, should think is simple: just do it. Nike's slogan reigns true.
 
 But for me, I've had troubles. I've partially developed bad habits in an suburban environment in which I over research and get districted trying to figure out how, when even I know all I have to do is just begin. Begin a project.
 
 Jonathan Blow approached these conflicts in a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqFutnYEANU">keynote speech</a>.
 
 Jonathan Blow is the developer of the video game Braid. A game that I consider the Watchmen of video games, as it exposes the potential of a medium, as it expresses art at such high quality no other game can compare. Thanks to recent software developments, now, a team of two people can create an entire game, allowing independent developers to express themselves. Now, there also are multiple platforms (Xbox Live, Steam, Facebook) for these games to reach a wide audience to. Now is the time for games to exceed, to become a medium that can compare to film or literature.
 
 He began with a presentation about "How and Why". He felt the reason people come to conferences is that people want to figure out how. "How do I become an indie developer", or "How do I get a publishing deal". This disregards the other half of the question: Why. "Why am I doing what I am doing?. What is my core motivation to do these things?"
 
 His answer was simple and mirrors my recent thoughts. The answer is that you already are an independent game developer, you just have to start making things. The How part will solve itself as you are making things.
 
 Although he is talking about independent games, these morals apply to any art medium. His answer reminded me of the ending of a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znIXyFh6dsI">poem</a> by Anis Mojghani in which he says, "Already am, already was, and I still have time to be".
 
 Thinking back now on films, I can't think of many where this conflict is fought. I can only think of films where only the external conflicts are displayed. Hrmm, so maybe it isn't a film cliche.
 
 So where does this leave me?
 
 After watching a great film, I'm able to think about life on a higher level, putting everything into perspective. I then feel that the things I've been doing recently are insignificant, I need to clean up all my shit and just do it. The problem is I never get to doing it.
 
 An associated major problem is the concern of money. My day job is programming. Most working environments for programming jobs aren't relaxing, or brooding creativity. They're marketing heavy, deadline driven, burn you out environments with a bad work/life balance. So, often, more time than I like is wasted in my day job.
 
 Again, I come to question what choices do I have? Find my way into an amazing profitable independent video game company? Most are just a few friends that got together and made up a cool company name. The other choice is slowly becoming inevitable: One day I will have to give up my day job and put all of my time, effort, and money into my personal work.
 
 I haven't gotten to that point yet. I haven't found a project that I feel great enough to. But I will do this: I will purge all of my insignificant crap that distracts me, so that I can focus on what's most important to me--my work. 142 2011-06-03 17:21:40 2011-06-03 21:21:40 open open overcoming-the-internal-conflicts-of-an-artist publish 0 0 post 0 art Braid do it internal conflict Jonathan Blow just do it money Personal Watchmen _edit_last 1 The Jack of all Trades http://rahilpatel.com/blog/the-jack-of-all-trades Thu, 29 Sep 2011 06:36:00 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=173 <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/the_jack_of_all_trades.html">Play the game</a>.
 
 This game is my submission for the Experimental Gameplay Project. The theme is <a href = http://experimentalgameplay.com/blog/2011/09/story-game-in-september-2011/>story game.</a>
 
 It is the first game I've ever created. It took most of the 7 unemployed days to complete. I did not use a game engine, hence the prevalence of bugs. I learned and used ActionScript. Special thanks to the developers of <a href = http://www.flashdevelop.org/wikidocs/index.php?title=Main_Page>FlashDevelop</a>. Without it, I would have given up.
 
 The game involves thoughts and experiences I've gone through recently. Mostly about finding yourself in a capitalist world. Although looking at the end product, the story seems like an overdone trope, something that belongs to the cheap clones theme. Still, I hope it resonates something within the player.
 
 Hint: Look for your heart, not the golden trophy. (although I shouldn't have to give a hint, I feel my level design is bad)

 Review/mind dump time!
 
 Today I saw Film Socialsime by Jean-Luc Godard at the lovely Pratt Institute (via Pratt Film Society). I have not seen Godard film before, and all I knew beforehand was that the film was broken into three parts and is likely unconventional.
 
 It turned out to be completely unconventional. No narrative and no helping the audience consume any of the content being displayed.
 
 I think it's better to just explain my personal experience.
 
 During the first movement, I constantly tried to find the meaning of each scene and of the entire film, like any good film viewer. I was able to see artistically why some shots and scenes were taken. Yes, a cruise is for the bourgeoisie, which contrasts the histories of the ports of call. Maybe further insulting the upper class by showing how easily they are amused by kittens. Why spend money on a cruise if kittens would suffice? The grainy cell phone shot at the discotheque was pretty cool. Maybe there was even a statement against the high modern popular filmmaking production value, as it seems there was little care for that.
 
 It felt as if an artsy amateur filmmaker went on a cruise, filmed as much as he/she could, picked out which scenes had some sort of artistic meaning, then combined them. Oh, and throw in a broken narrative that mentions large political problems (wars, AIDS) and condense it further into decrepit subtitles. I can imagine this playing at video_dumbo at the DUMBO arts festival (an event that showcases extremely experimental film) at midnight. And no one would care.
 
 But this is Godard! And that is the only difference between this film and the other hundreds playing at arts festivals.
 
 I stopped paying attention near the beginning of the second movement. I consider myself patient and appreciative, but this hit my limit. It's a film that cannot be consumed regularly. It's more of something to discuss, maybe interpret other's experience or reactions. Which is cool, but I still feel does not work. If I were a critic, I'd give it a 0. Maybe he should have written an essay instead of making a film.
 
 While I was not paying attention to the film, I wondered about why the film failed (I still would not like to credit this film for making me think!). I think he was trying to push the medium into different ways, but it didn't work. Why didn't it work? Well, a film has to be somewhat cohesive to form...well something! You can't just throw nothing together and let the audience interpret what happened. Well, I think I have seen that in some other art form. Anyhow, I personally feel a film should have some cohesiveness (oh no! I'm stating what a film SHOULD have, that's limiting creativity man!). Or how about, a film should have a point. I guess this film's point was to be unconventional. Whatever.
 
 I wonder if Jean-Luc Godard has a personality that seeks for something new every time. So he began with the now categorized "new-wave" films, which is a little unconventional, but still consumable by 5% of the population. Then, as he got older, he became less and less satisfied with current films, which urged him to be even more unconventional, more experimental. So unconventional that his latest film, Film Socialisme, was completely incoherent! Hah, seems like a sound theory to me!
 
 Welp, I think that's enough. I hope this post was as incoherent as the film was!
 
 Edit:
 
 I had another thought about Film Socialisme and Blow's approach to game design on the way back from Pratt.
 
 Although Film Socialisme makes a bad film, obviously not meant for entertainment, it's not bad as a standalone art. Instead of offering an experience through narrative, the experience is based on the audience's reaction.
 
 Similarly, Blow's approach to game design and Rod Humble's The Marriage, doesn't tell the player what to do, it's up to the player to learn, think, and make their own experience. 222 2011-10-19 02:41:48 2011-10-19 06:41:48 open open film-socialisme publish 0 0 post 0 experimental experimental film Film Reviews Film Socialisme Films Jean Luc-Godard _edit_last 1 _yoast_wpseo_content_score 60 _yoast_wpseo_primary_category medium_post O:11:"Medium_Post":11:{s:16:"author_image_url";s:74:"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/200/200/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png";s:10:"author_url";s:28:"https://medium.com/@rahil627";s:11:"byline_name";N;s:12:"byline_email";N;s:10:"cross_link";s:2:"no";s:2:"id";s:12:"9c745c7141e0";s:21:"follower_notification";s:3:"yes";s:7:"license";s:19:"all-rights-reserved";s:14:"publication_id";s:12:"7a04709b0155";s:6:"status";s:6:"public";s:3:"url";s:72:"https://medium.com/@rahil627/film-socialisme-film-socialism-9c745c7141e0";} The Real Ninja http://rahilpatel.com/blog/the-real-ninja Thu, 20 Oct 2011 06:56:28 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=226 <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/the_real_ninja.html">Play the game</a>.
 
 This game is my submission for this month's Experimental Gameplay Project competition. The theme is <a href = http://experimentalgameplay.com/blog/2011/10/october-2011-is-slicing/>slicing.</a>
 
 I stuck with ActionScript, but this time I used an engine, <a href="http://flashpunk.net/" title="FlashPunk">FlashPunk</a>! I must give credit to the amazing <a href = http://www.flashdevelop.org/wikidocs/index.php?title=Main_Page>FlashDevelop</a> again.
 
 I've got to warn you that this is very unexperimental and goes against the values of the experimental gameplay project. I knew this going in when I chose the idea. I had a conflict. How does a new game developer develop expiremental game mechanics without having the experience of creating any games? I had more complex ideas, but I was afraid that I wouldn't be able to create it, afraid of losing motivation to overcome the hurdles during development. Instead I decided to choose a simple idea, so that I could create an entire game, polished, with my own art and sounds. To know what it takes to create a game. It's a stepping stone for my game development career. Polishing is essential to developing games too. What good is an expiremental game if you never create a final product out of it? It's just a prototype, an idea. My game doesn't belong on Experimental Gameplay Project, but EGP did inspire and motivate me to create a game. So I feel that it's a failure to EGP, but a personal success.
 
 Welp, that's my excuse. Now that I feel more confident to take on more challenging prototypes, I swear my next project will be more experimental.
 
 It's 11mb in size. Yep, it's a cheesy runner/fruit ninja hybrid.
 
 EDIT: ...And the <a href="http://experimentalgameplay.com/blog/2011/10/slicing-roundup/">results</a> are in!
 
 Postmortem:
 I started out thinking about slicing idea and writing some out in my composition book. I had a few oh-so-cliche-for-indie puzzle platformers. One about folding, with three different mechanic ideas. I googled around to see if they were done already. <a href="http://www.nitrome.com/games/faultline/">Faultline</a> used one and in my opinion turned out to be a fantastic game. <a href="http://www.gamesetwatch.com/2010/01/foldable_platformer_paper_cake.php">Paper Cakes</a> used one, and was a student showcase at IGF 2010. The third one was about folding platforms. I also had two more mechanics that dealt with cutting an entire platform game into a rooms, then moving those around. I didn't find any game that has done either of them yet.
 
 As I said, I'm a new developer and was afraid of being unable to output anything useful in the limited time, so I chose a runner fruit ninja style slicing game. I even had some neat ideas for that game: like using Box2d to actually cut through the enemies or cutting the stage to leave voids (which is required to solve some problem) or using gestures to cut in various ways.
 
 None of this happened. I was only able to implement the fruit ninja slicing mechanic with normal collision. The rest of the time went into polishing, level design, art, sounds, voiceovers, etc. I learned that the core of a game (the main idea and core mechanics) is made within the first few days, the other 90% is polish. That's rough. Are all other arts this brutal? The core mechanics of Braid was made in two weeks and it took an additional three years to reach the final version. I think so.

 Well, not the whole story. I've divided the story into two parts as I was involved with two games, one with a team and one personal. The first story is about the development of my personal game. The second story is about my experience at the game jam and the development of the team game. I'll start at the time the theme was given.
 
 <h2>The Personal Story</h2>
 
 Jammers (I'm making this term up) were able to choose any posts by the <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/Horse_ebooks">Horse ebooks twitter account</a>. No one knows the origin or reason for the account. It appears to be run by a program which grabs phrases from the internet and posts it every few hours. The results are interesting, as some phrases seem poetic.
 
 Initially I was felt bummed out for having such a broad theme, but then some of the more thoughtful posts stuck out to me. "Will there be cars without drivers?". I thought about some futuristic place where suddenly the protagonist realized there are cars without drivers. Where are they all going? What is their purpose? The second one that stuck out was "Can you imagine yourself as a verbal assassin?". So I imagined. How can you be a verbal assassin? What dose that even mean? How do you kill with words? Is the theme implying that a verbal assassin is lesser than a normal assassin? Then somehow I got the idea that the assassin talks out loud, "move up, move up, move up, stab". That's going to 'cause problems with an assassination. People will hear the assassin. Then the vision of a Metal Gear type game came up, in which sound waves are displayed every time the character talks, and you must be careful so that the enemies cannot hear you. Most of these thoughts occurred within the first hour. It was the most exciting part. There was so much creativity brooding.
 
 I didn't spend very long on the game. Maybe 5 hours one day and 4 hours the next day. I got the core mechanics down the first day and threw in a story and level design the next day. Because I didn't spend much time on it, I wanted it to just show the mechanic, the idea, in the comedic way. No polish. I could have added Metal Gear sounds, or even a parody of it. I'm sure if I polished it it would have been more fun for the jammers to play. But I guess after making my last game, I don't care for polish. I only care for experimenting and art.
 
 The game didn't fly so well with the players. I should have reduced "move up" to "up", as players got frustrated typing, or were just unable to touch type (that was painful to watch). "Move up" was in there because I had I planned to add other mechanics such as "say move up"/"whisper move up"/"yell something"/"stab up"/etc. I actually had a more difficult second level, but I correctly guessed that it would have frustrated the player so bad that they would never get to the ending. Ah well. Again, my game wasn't meant to be popular or polished, it was meant to be experimental.
 
 It was fun to see different personalities play. Some without patience. Some expecting more polish. Very few able to figure out they could move in any direction. I guess a simple fun platformer like MeatBoy is what they desired. Too bad this was not the game.
 
 I guess that's my personal gripe against game jams. It seems the most polished game (fully equipped with assets) would win. Even in Ludum Dare, this happens. I would personally strive for the most innovative badge, not the best game overall. Who cares for a non-creative polished 5 minute game?
 
 Of course I didn't win anything. Actually, I was surprised that the game I voted for won first from the judges. That game actually was unique, fit a craaazy theme, and was polished. Congrats to that guy. The other winners were simple polished games.
 
 I still love the idea of my game and may go further with it. Using a microphone, the player could say "up" and the sound wave and character movement would depend on the player's volume. A teammate mentioned maybe the sound waves could bounce off of the certain walls. That'd be awesome too. I'm reminded of <a href="http://www.devilstuningfork.com/">Devil's Tuning Fork</a>. I think waves itself can be explored a lot more.
 
 <h2>The Team Story</h2>
 
 Rewind back to the beginning, when the theme was given. All of the jammers started looking at the feeds on their Macbooks and Iphones, throwing out ideas. Teams were not chosen by an administrator. Jammers were just told to form teams within the first few hours, naturally. Veteran jammers, and anyone who came with a friend were already had a team. The stragglers just awkwardly gravitated toward another and it eventually worked out. There were a bunch of programmers, some musicians/sound folks, some illustrators, and everyone was essentially a game designer.
 
 The team I got along with was awesome. Really great people with good taste and values, which was discussed at some random bar that served meatballs and potatoes, and later at Barcade. The discussion of art in games was really interesting. It's nice to know that everyone agrees that Braid is a powerful statement, that Machinarium is cool, and that Gears of War is a teenage kid's fantasy.
 
 Moving along, the team consisted of me, an iOS programmer, a Processing programmer/sound engineer, and a game designer/artist/musician/asset master. Three programmers whom all used different languages. Perfect.
 
 One of the ideas that the game designer pitched was about the horse tweet "Advantage". The player needs an advantage over other players to win. A multiplayer game in which everyone is against a common enemy, yet compete against each other. It's simultaneously cooperative and competitive. That was the main idea/mechanic. It could be applied to any kind of game. The first game that came to both of our minds was space invaders. It works, it's fun, it's easy to implement. So, he later pitches the idea to the other two, then we go to the drawing board, and bam, a game.
 
 To win, one player must have x points more than the player with the second most points. Everyone loses when the enemies destroy the base.
 
 We wanted the game to be four players, so the iOS developer was silently chosen as the main programmer. The other programmer planned to learn Objective-C/cocoas2d/box2d and help. The game designer/asset master created design documentation, raster graphic art, AND music (It was amazing how he just made Egyptian melodies. It even had basslines!). I sorta left the group, as I didn't feel I'd be helpful programming in a framework I'm unfamiliar with within 48 hours.
 
 From what I gathered, the iOS developer (who's just started programming recently) had troubles using Box2d and wished he hadn't used it at all as it was the cause of most of the problems. Without it, I'm sure he could have made the game. So in the end, the game was incomplete. I believe it would have won if it was complete. I think the team is going to finish it anyway. I'll even look at it myself, to try iOS developemnt.
 
 So the moral of the story is: If you plan to create a full game, use the framework you are most familiar with. Learning a new one (or one you are inexperienced with) within 48 hours is tough. Oh, and if you plan to win, make it simple, polished, and minutely creative. 635 2011-10-24 20:28:44 2011-10-25 00:28:44 open open my-first-game-jam publish 0 0 post 0 Game Development Games horse ebooks Personal _edit_last 1 _yoast_wpseo_primary_category medium_post O:11:"Medium_Post":11:{s:16:"author_image_url";s:74:"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/200/200/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png";s:10:"author_url";s:28:"https://medium.com/@rahil627";s:11:"byline_name";N;s:12:"byline_email";N;s:10:"cross_link";s:2:"no";s:2:"id";s:11:"c882fe96fe6";s:21:"follower_notification";s:3:"yes";s:7:"license";s:19:"all-rights-reserved";s:14:"publication_id";s:2:"-1";s:6:"status";s:6:"public";s:3:"url";s:58:"https://medium.com/@rahil627/my-first-game-jam-c882fe96fe6";} Early Film Criticism http://rahilpatel.com/blog/early-film-criticism Sat, 01 May 2010 13:20:52 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=6515 <blockquote>[old thought] what seperates a good movie from a bad one is realism. remove the hollywood plot and music. everything must be real - the character's personalities, the outcome, the randomness, everything. add good cinematography, and BAM! you have a good movie.

Mostly because I am unemployed and not working on anything. I've slowly been coming to term with my own personality, who I am. <strong>I'm a lone adventurer, who embarks on his own path, experiencing everything personally, with an open heart. Nobody's opinion has influenced me in another direction. Every choice I make is composed purely of my own judgement and feeling.</strong> Living in a house near family and friends restricts my personal adventures. I never turn down favors, and I'm quite technical, so I'm often helping others. A job in a company feels the same. I'm just helping someone else. "It's nothing personal, just business". None of it is satisfying as a personal adventure.
 
 Now that I've come closer to knowing myself, I think I know what I can be. Using my personal experiences and expressing it through a medium, I think I could be a great artist. I feel that I have the taste and vision of one.

 Mass media play a significant role in shaping public perceptions on a variety of important issues, both through the information that is dispensed through them, and through the interpretations they place upon this information. They also play a large role in shaping modern culture, by selecting and portraying a particular set of beliefs, values, and traditions (an entire way of life), as reality. That is, by portraying a certain interpretation of reality, they shape reality to be more in line with that interpretation.

Melee (Early Game Criticism) http://rahilpatel.com/blog/super-smash-bros-melee-early-game-criticism Wed, 15 Jun 2011 13:30:36 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=6537 <blockquote>explaining Super Smash Bros. to a non-player:
 
 SSBM is a strategy game with a physical requirement. That is, to get to a professional level of play, you do need to reach a certain physical requirement which requires practice. After that point it becomes strategy, and the smartest always win.
 
 American sports are physical games, meaning a physical better player can beat a tactically smarter player. This is why soccer and hockey are regarded higher than American sports. In soccer or hockey, a physically normal person can have great achievements. Wayne Gretzky being the perfect example. He's physically normal, but he know how to play the game, know when to play safe, know when to take opportunities, use knowledge to exploit the game.
 
 Due to that physical requirement, SSBM is by no means a perfect tactical game such as chess, but it holds its own. I'd argue it is far more complex. In chess you are given strict rules of what you can/cannot do--a king can only move one space in all directions. Similarly in Smash, you have a character with a given move set. But Smash has a lot more other factors--stages, approximation of hitboxes, game anomalies, etc. I imagine if you and your opponent chose the same character, you would essentially be playing a pure tactical game, such as chess (assuming both players are nearly physically equal).
 
 So, SSBM is more comparable to Starcraft and Street Fighter 3, which they too has a physical requirement of hand-eye coordination to reach a pro level but becomes tactical after that, many factors (maps, unit hatboxes, build order/resources). Both games are overly complex to the point that no human can play a perfect game. They are so complex that new exploits are being found 10 years after the game was made.
 At the same time are the most entertaining, possibly because of how complex it is.
 
 It's possible that Super Street Fighter 4 (a little less so with SSBB) maybe a better competitive video game, as it has a low physical requirement, but still remains a strategic game, in which the smartest players still win.
 
 Yet, these are not as entertaining. Hmm.
 
 I guess any fighting game can be considered successful by my definition, as the smarter player will always win. Eh.
 
 Hmm, I can't verbalize what makes this previous games so entertaining above SSF4 or chess. Maybe I haven't gotten into chess. But I think it has to do with playing tactically. No, creatively! YES. Creativity. In a strict ruleset such as SSF4, one might feel more restricted. I'm sure there are new tactics evolving in SSF4, but in the previous games, creativity is abundant, due to the large amount of factors/rules that make up the game.
 
 This allows for more creativity, an ever-evolving game. Sure, more radical than the former games, but creativity is exciting! The game of chess is done: generations have played it, there are books that explain tactics--what to do to counter your opponent in a given situation, there maybe be an ounce of creativity that only a prodigy chess player could find, but for the most part, its over. Video games are new. There's a new set of rules with many tactics waiting to be found out! This, I believe, is what creates so much excitement in those previous games.
 
 Creativity. How fitting.

I follow what my body signals me. During the day, I'm more creative; At night, I can get hard work done. I eat when my body tells me to, not becuase it's time to eat. I excercise when my body tells me to, often at night or especially after working in an office for 8 hours. I take breaks, strech, to step back and think about problems at a higher level. I eat protien for lunch to avoid a high blood sugar spike. I eat fruit and nuts at night because I feel like having something juicy, not grains or protien. I move around throughout the day, rarely sitting in the same position for a prolonged period of time. I use a yoga ball as a chair. I try to have a comfortable ninety degree angle for my legs and use a keyboard tray. I move my neck around a lot because after looking at a computer, it just doesn't feel right.

 I feel that this lifestyle is more healthy than one who bases their actions on time. A person who lives based on time may do some of the following. Eat at the same times, even though they woke up late. Excercise at set times, even though their body doesn't benefit from it. Work at a set time, such as working in the morning even if they're a late afternoon person. These people also aren't active throughout the day. If their activity were a graph, it would be a roller coaster. Eating a large lunch (high blood sugar), napping right after (low), working at a sedentary office job (low), heavy excercise / weightlifting (high), overeating again (low), etc. I'd associate this to the blood sugar / glucogen problem. Furthermore, when people have high blood sugar, they crash, being unable to focus. End up wasting hours on Facebook, or making their job feel even longer. This also makes them more suspectible to falling into a stupor and watching mass media. Or, they temporarily fix this by taking a drug: caffiene, 5 hour energy, ridilin, etc. Hm.

I want to disprove this.
 
 Was all that time I played video games as a kid meaningless entertainment? I don't think it was. I want to pinpoint the art of video games, and without the heavy use of auxiliary arts (graphics, sounds, music), prove this theory with a prototype.
 
 The main thing that comes to mind is the feeling of exploration. Exploration of an unknown environment with unknown rules.
 
 In Earthbound, the player comes across saturns whom speak in a ridiculous language ($#@!). Does that mean saturns are good or bad? The player interacts with them to figure out they are good. 
 
 Similarly, in Shadow of the Colossus, the player must interact with the colossi and the surrounding area to discover new elements which are required to solve the puzzles. 
 
 It's this player interaction. It's the discovery of game rules. This is unique to video games.
 
 exploration -> player interaction -> discovery/learning -> fulfillment (the good kind)
 
 Hmm..well that's all I've got so far. I was going to draw a prototype, but I felt that the games that exist are enough to demonstrate this. <a href="http://windosill.com/">Windosill</a> is a the perfect example. This is enough to make me feel less bad for playing so many games when I was young. I just felt that it wasn't a complete waste of time, that there was something there, some new experience that interested me.
 
 Maybe there's more than exploration and player interaction to it. I mean is that really enough to be art? Shouldn't there be some auteur's vision here? I dunno. I'll come back to this if I ponder more about it.
 
 EDIT:
 I just realized the past video games I refer to in this post refer to a small portion of all of the games I've played. Other reasons to play include competition and social entertainment (with friends). I'm ignoring those games in this post. 306 2011-11-02 18:46:49 2011-11-02 22:46:49 open open my-justification-of-art-in-video-games publish 0 0 post 0 art game exploration Games player interaction shadow of the colossus windosill _edit_last 1 _wp_old_slug my-theory-of-art-existance-in-past-video-games Poorly Designed Upgrades http://rahilpatel.com/blog/poorly-designed-upgrades Tue, 15 Nov 2011 10:21:55 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=322 <h2><a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/poorly_designed_upgrades.html">Play the game</a></h2>

 This game is my submission for this month's Experimental Gameplay Project competition. The theme is <a href="http://experimentalgameplay.com/blog/2011/11/upgrade-in-november-2011/">upgrade</a>.
 
 I used ActionScript, <a href="http://www.flashdevelop.org/wikidocs/index.php?title=Main_Page">FlashDevelop</a>, and <a title="FlashPunk" href="http://flashpunk.net/">FlashPunk</a> again.
 
 Last time I promised EGP and myself the game would be experimental. It's certainly more experimental than my previous games, but not quite enough. The ideas are there but I cheated myself and conveyed them on a shoot 'em up genre game. Never again!
 
 <h2>Instructions</h2>
 
 <h3>Goal</h3>
 Experiment with different upgrade setups to prevent enemies from reaching the bottom of the screen in various challenges.
 
 <h3>Controls</h3>
 wasd or arrow keys to move
 space bar to fire
 f to autofire (on by default)
 
 while in sandbox screen:
 - and + to decrease or increase enemy HP (can hold the key down)
 [ and ] to decrease or increase enemy spawn rate (can hold the key down)
 u to enter the upgrade screen
 1, 2, 3 to start a challenge
 
 while in upgrade screen:
 left click on the canvas to draw the current upgrade. This works similar to the pencil tool in a graphics editing program
 *you can only draw on the ship or a neighboring pixel of the current upgrade
 *you cannot overlap other upgrades
 *protip, each <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_neighborhood">4-connected neighborhood</a> is treated as a separate gun

Nice to see a smasher making games! =O 1 339 1 춤추는 동물원 (Dancing Zoo) http://rahilpatel.com/blog/dancing-zoo Wed, 23 Nov 2011 17:45:42 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=349 I caught the North American premiere of Dancing Zoo which was screened for free by the <a href="http://www.koreanculture.org/?document_srl=21035">Korean Cultural Service of New York</a>.
 
 The film is almost too similar <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Once_(film)">Once</a>. Much of the narrative is sung or told through soft spoken conversation. It's immediately known that the level of realism, maturity, and quality is not at on par with Once, but it still has all the charm.
 
 In Dancing Zoo, two very young musicians fall in love, discover the impossibility of working (and assumed living) with each other, but are thankful for the experience.
 
 The film does appear to be cheesy at times, but I felt some of it was natural as the leads were two young Koreans. I'd guess around college age but I could be wrong as Koreans do appear young. Their age and their actions caused a little conflict in my believability. Two college age Asians wondering about, playing music, living in their own apartments, living the artist way of life. Hmm, maybe they were older than I thought.
 
 I also felt the film was somewhat natural because it depicted some characteristics that Koreans have. In the perspective of an American, the film can appear as an inauthentic, cutesy, dreamy, romantic story. Although that's somewhat true, I felt that a real Korean relationship may certainly be just as cutesy, dreamy, and romantic. The characters' gestures of greetings and farewells are sweet and shy. The notion of having sex after a date does not exist; Perhaps that's an American notion emblazoned by Hollywood. The characters' use little dialogue in communication. Well, that's not specifically an Asian trait, that's universal, but it felt right.
 
 So although the film is flawed, having bad screenplay at times, disjointed at other times, and unbelievably cutesy (everyone laughed at the early romantic montage), it still retains some authenticity in the way a real, young Korean relationship could be, as I don't know for certain and can't compare. It even retains an atmosphere of realism throughout the film's narrative. The characters make emotional and rational decisions, falling victim to love, learning from experience, and maturing from it.
 
 Somehow all of this is conveyed in a film which is in song seventy percent of the time. The music never hindered my viewing. It consisted of the expected simple acoustic songwriting music and sometimes indie electronic music. I actually remember disliking Once at many parts because the same old guitar chords repeated for every song. This didn't happen here. The music never became annoying. It fit, complementing the slow paced dreamy film.
 
 For me the pros outweighed the cons during my viewing and I was able to dream along with the characters in the movie, forgetting it's flaws. I wondered if Koreans are characteristically quiet and well-natured. I wondered if romance is worth the time. Slow paced films allow me to wonder. I'm glad to have experienced such a unique, independent film coming from Korea. The only Korean films I've seen were by already acclaimed directors Park Chan-wook and Bong Joon-ho. I can only hope for a new wave of this kind from all parts of Asia. Or perhaps great little films exist worldwide and I just lucked out by catching the premiere of this one at a tiny theater in Chinatown. 349 2011-11-23 12:45:42 2011-11-23 17:45:42 open open dancing-zoo publish 0 0 post 0 Asian characteristics Film Reviews Films Korean Cinema Korean Film Korean Wave Once _edit_last 1 _yoast_wpseo_content_score 30 _yoast_wpseo_primary_category medium_post O:11:"Medium_Post":11:{s:16:"author_image_url";s:74:"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/200/200/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png";s:10:"author_url";s:28:"https://medium.com/@rahil627";s:11:"byline_name";N;s:12:"byline_email";N;s:10:"cross_link";s:2:"no";s:2:"id";s:12:"d70d0227dbde";s:21:"follower_notification";s:3:"yes";s:7:"license";s:19:"all-rights-reserved";s:14:"publication_id";s:12:"7a04709b0155";s:6:"status";s:6:"public";s:3:"url";s:109:"https://medium.com/@rahil627/%EC%B6%A4%EC%B6%94%EB%8A%94-%EB%8F%99%EB%AC%BC%EC%9B%90-dancing-zoo-d70d0227dbde";} The Choice between Career and Exploration http://rahilpatel.com/blog/the-choice-between-career-and-exploration Fri, 25 Nov 2011 10:38:18 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=396 [Old thought, just posting without proofreading.]

 A recurring thought. Media is distracting. So much time is wasted experiencing media. Facebook, TV shows, the Internet. It's much wiser to allocate that time into creating things.
 
 Life is a balancing game. You have to balance work (for profit), art, family, friends, and free time.
 
 More narrowly, you also have to balance daily life. I feel I am closer to my body than others are. I follow what my body signals me. During the day, I'm more creative; At night, I can get hard work done. I eat when my body tells me to, not becuase it's time to eat. I excercise when my body tells me to, often at night or especially after working in an office for 8 hours. I take breaks, strech, to step back and think about problems at a higher level. I eat protien for lunch to avoid a high blood sugar spike. I eat fruit and nuts at night because I feel like having something juicy, not grains or protien. I move around throughout the day, rarely sitting in the same position for a prolonged period of time. I use a yoga ball as a chair. I try to have a comfortable ninety degree angle for my legs and use a keyboard tray. I move my neck around a lot because after looking at a computer, it just doesn't feel right. That's the word: feeling. I go by feeling. My gut reaction.
 
 I feel that this lifestyle is more healthy than one who bases their actions on time. A person who lives based on time may do some of the following. Eat at the same times, even though they woke up late. Excercise at set times, even though their body doesn't benefit from it. Work at a set time, such as working in the morning even if they're a late afternoon person. These people also aren't active throughout the day. If their activity were a graph, it would be a roller coaster. Eating a large lunch (high blood sugar), napping right after (low), working at a sedentary office job (low), heavy excercise / weightlifting (high), overeating again (low), etc. I'd associate this to the blood sugar / glucogen problem. Furthermore, when people have high blood sugar, they crash, being unable to focus. End up wasting hours on Facebook, or making their job feel even longer. This also makes them more suspectible to falling into a stupor and watching mass media. Or, they temporarily fix this by taking a drug: caffiene, 5 hour energy, ridilin, etc.
 
 Hm. So maybe carbs are to blame? Carbs, excercise, and motivation.
 
 BLOG THE ABOVE!
 
 11/23
 After Ivar left for Thanksgiving break, my mind has went on a thinking tangent. Having someone nearby keeps me focused on work. Now that he's gone, I've just been thinking. On life, my future, family, friends.
 
 I've said before, at my core I'm a vagabond. I like to explore, live, create. This can be seen as greedy as it takes away from family time. I just have to make sure I commnicate with my family and friends while I'm gone. Start using skype weekly. Go to India with my parents next time.
 
 I would be okay with living in poverty as long as I'm doing the things I like. I'll only comprimise to a desk job if I need the money or social interaction.
 
 It's no different then when I was young. Before, I used to explore neighborhoods on my bike. I still explore neighborhoods on my bike! But now I can go further, around the world. I also now have the confidence to make things. I have a much clearer mind. I'm healthy.
 
 I really need to work on an art, with integrity, using everything I've got. No small projects, only ambitous ones.
 
 How do I balance, exploration, art, and family? I want to live all over of the world, yet make a great artpeice which requires a lot of time, and somehow be at home periodically. What to choose?
 
 I said before, at this age, I need to create. But is exploring also limited to this age? Is 30s+ all family time?
 
 Go for it. Explore and try to create simultaneously. Go for that crazy exploration trip around the world.
 
 Explore -&gt; Discover -&gt; Experience -&gt; Inspire -&gt; Create, repeat, and communicate with family throughout
 
 Only the final product matters, not how you get there.
 
 Hm. Should I contruct a side business that's somewhat profitable? Only if I am truly interested in it! That would still be considered being influenced by money. But still, that may be better than relying on contracts/part time jobs, 'cause that's working for somebody else.
 
 You can't have both due to the immigration limitations [link] that restrict you from staying over 90 days.
 
 I could easily move to another english speaking country (New Zealand, Austrailia). I could even teach English in an Asian country (Jet Programme wiki), but I don't want to work for a job I'm not interested in. I've already concluded that's a waste of time. [link to nofilmschool]. I need to work on my interests. Film, video games, this blog, etc. So it seems moving to another country without an indendent career or a job I'm interested lined up is a waste.
 
 I've almost decided to go back to San Francisco. Continue being myself, doing as I wish.
 
 The next time my parents go to India, I can go with them and time an East Asia trip before that. When I do go to India, I'd also like to learn my native language (Gujarati), spoken and written. Travel around India for a while. 396 2011-11-25 05:38:18 2011-11-25 10:38:18 open open the-choice-between-career-and-exploration publish 0 0 post 0 Personal Self-assessment _edit_last 1 Inspired by Films (and everything else) http://rahilpatel.com/blog/inspired-by-films-and-everything-else Mon, 28 Nov 2011 11:10:30 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=426 After watching a great film I am inspired. It just happened again with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/35_Shots_of_Rum">35 Shots of Rum</a>.
 
 After experiencing a great film I reflect upon my life, my past present and future.
 
 It reminds me of what's important in life, placing everything into perspective. I immediately begin to remove anything invaluable nearby (close browser tabs, clean my desk, clear my schedule) so that I can focus on what's most important. It keeps me on track.
 
 Sometimes it pulls me away from my lucky American life, and makes me think about how wastefully I've spent my time and money. It holds me close to the ideal <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_living">simple life</a>. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_Push_Cart">Man Push Cart</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtles_can_fly">Turtles Can Fly</a>].
 
 Sometimes it reminds me that I am not the only one and that I am normal. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apu_trilogy">The Apu Trilogy</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tree_of_Life_(film)">Tree of Life</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish_Tank_(film)">Fish Tank</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Still_Walking_(2008_film)">Still Walking</a>].
 
 Other times I just ponder. It's sadly one of the few times in my life I am not busy, away from the distractions of the modern world. An ample portion of my thoughts text file was written after watching a film. I owe films for providing me these crucial moments. I've made many life altering decisions during them.
 
 Of course it's not limited to films. It could be a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znIXyFh6dsI">a Youtube video</a>, a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchmen">comic book</a>, a crucial life event, anything. But it's so convenient to watch a film in two hours on my laptop knowing that there's a great chance of it affecting me. It's a tough decision to risk my time on anything else when I know I can be satisfied with a film. 426 2011-11-28 06:10:30 2011-11-28 11:10:30 open open inspired-by-films-and-everything-else publish 0 0 post 0 art film film inspiration motivation Personal _edit_last 1 _wp_old_slug inspired-by-films-and-other-arts Replacing a Hard Disk Drive with Mac OS X and Boot Camp http://rahilpatel.com/blog/replacing-a-hard-disk-drive-with-mac-os-x-and-boot-camp Tue, 13 Mar 2012 21:17:04 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=504 I wanted to install Unity to create a 3D game I thought of for EGP but I can't because I don't have enough space on my Boot Camp partition! The feeling of being blocked from the things you want to do is awful.
 
 I have MacBook Pro (13" early 2011, Model Number: A1278) with 196GB allocated to the Mac OS X 10.7 (Lion) partition and 42GB allocated to the Windows 7 partition. Bad idea, as I've found I use Windows 95% of the time now. After a searching a little on Google it seems there is no recommended (reliable and popular) way to re-size the partition, instead I must re-install the Boot Camp partition.
 
 While researching I thought this would be a good time to finally upgrade to a solid-state drive and do everything at once.
 
 After little research I've decided to choose the Samsung 830 over the Crucial m4 and Intel 510 (all 256GB versions) based on the few MacRumors threads I read. I calculated my Windows install (applications, but no media) takes the full 37.9GB with 4GB virtual memory, and my Mac OS X install takes around 80GB (or was it 60?*). I don't want to run into this problem of low space again, so I decided on the larger 256GB drives. From what I gather the Samsung 830 controller is newer/better, compatible with Mac OS X, and can update the firmware from within Boot Camp. Normally I'd choose Intel so I don't have to worry about reliability, but I did not see any price or performance competitive options from Intel. Besides, I loves me some Samsung.
 
 Upon reading the current <a href="http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/ssd-review-benchmark,3115.html">Best SSDs For The Money article by Tom's Hardware</a> I stumbled upon a <a href="http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/ssd-laptop-upgrade-optical-bay,3102.html">neat solution</a> which allows you to install a second hard disk drive in the optical bay. MacRumor users found a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Drive-Unibody-MacBook-SuperDrive-Replacement/dp/B0058AH2US">cheap alternative form Amazon</a>. I'm thinking about ordering one and placing my hard disk drive in there.
 
 Just thinking ahead of a good video editing system, I could store the original footage on the hard disk (HFS+) and edit on the SSD. My current external hard drive uses NTFS and I use a NTFS driver (NTFS-3G or Paragon, I don't remember) to read it from Mac OS X. I remembered reading something about the exFAT file system. That sounded like the perfect file system for external drives, but after a little research it wasn't. I'll have to do some more reading.
 
 I'll update this post early next month with my results. It might even be separated into two posts, resizing and buying a SSD.
 
 UPDATE:
 Success. I was able to clone my Mac and Windows installations. For the most part I followed <a href="http://johnbeales.com/20110330/transferring-osx-bootcamp-to-new-hard-drive/">this well-written guide</a>. It was an overall smooth process.
 
 Here's a tiny list of hurdles I went through:
 
 Before I began I uninstalled NTFS for Mac driver. I'm not sure if this was necessary.
 
 <blockquote>2. Follow the wizard to create a BootCamp partition. This partition does not need to be the same size as your old Boot Camp partition. When Boot Camp Assistant asks you to insert a Windows install disk quit Boot Camp Assistant. Your partition is created.</blockquote>
 During this step, when I clicked install in WinClone, it would ask for a Windows disk without creating a partition. I had to insert my Windows 7 disk for it to partition. After that, my PC restarted and booted from the Windows CD. From here I selected the Boot Camp partition and selected format (after clicking advanced options). I don't think this did anything though. I then quit the setup, restarted the PC, held options to boot into Mac, and continued to recover the image from WinClone.
 <blockquote>8. Turn on your Mac holding down the Option key on the keyboard. You should see your Boot Camp partition as a boot option, (it’s probably labeled “Windows”). Select it to boot into Windows.</blockquote>
 
 The first time I tried to boot into Windows the PC displayed a blank black screen with a Windows mouse cursor. I had to hard power off. The next boot worked perfectly.
 
 After I was done I was able to use Samsung Magician software to update the solid-state drive's firmware within Boot Camp. I used the Windows update option, as opposed to creating a bootable CD or USB.
 
 I also checked to see if disk defragmenter was turned off in Windows as it is not needed for solid-state drives.
 
 Finally, Mac OS X feels as nimble as Window 7. As I had guessed, the hard drive was the bottleneck. The good old Core 2 Duo lives another day. Also, it's nice not to have to move files around to compensate for the lack of space. So worth the time.

 There's far too many choices. Do I get a consumer camcorder, a prosumer camcorder, a DSLR with video capabilities, or a real professional film camera? Well, the consumer camcorders have the consumer look, prosumer camcorders produce the same quality but have more buttons, DSLRs are missing features to consider it as a video camera, and a real film camera costs $7000.
 
 A "pro" would say. Buy a real film camera. If you don't have the money but know that film is what you want to do in life, save up for a real film camera.
 
 A smart person will tell you to film with whatever you have. If the camera is limiting your abilities, buy whatever is within your budget.
 
 If I could turn back time I'd buy a $600 TM-900 and start shooting; Then buy things as I need them.
 
 That didn't happen. I over-researched, spending more time reading when I could have been shooting. I ended up with a $1150 Panasonic DMC-GH2 with the 14-140mm lens. Although I don't regret my purchase I do regret the time wasted.
 
 Hm, now I'm unsure if I should provide the research I did as it may enable a reader to continue researching.
 
 Might be updated soon!

 Even though that Panasonic was the gem of DSLR / mirror-less film-making, it sucked as a film camera. The stabilization made it impossible for any sort of recording while walking. The camera itself was large. The camera would eat up battery and memory cards.
 
 I sold it and bought a Panasonic v750. USB-powered and steadicam-like stabilization. If only I had bought the camcorder two years ago. 513 2012-02-18 22:08:07 2012-02-19 03:08:07 open open buying-a-professional-video-camera publish 0 0 post 0 DMC-GH2 Filmmaking GH2 Specific Guides _edit_last 1 Fixing Err-3 on a 1998 Acura Integra Car Stereo http://rahilpatel.com/blog/fixing-err-3-on-a-1998-acura-integra-car-stereo Mon, 12 Mar 2012 09:19:11 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=532 It's wonderful what you can do with Google.
 
 My sister told me her car stereo wasn't working. I checked it and found that it displayed Err-3. After a little Googling I discovered this is part of the anti-theft system and must have triggered after the battery had recently died.
 
 Here are the steps to reset the anti-theft system:
 <ol>
 <li>Check if your car has a sticker with a code written on it. Here's a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgfRmBo7Pu0">video</a> that shows possible locations. If you find the code, skip to step 5.</li>
 <li><a href="http://www.team-integra.net/forum/blogs/morningz/43-g3-radio-removal.html">Pull out the stereo</a> to obtain the device serial number and keep it pulled out.</li>
 <li>Write down the serial number so that you don't have to remove the stereo again</li>
 <li>Get the code by supplying the serial number, VIN, and other information. Try this <a href="https://radio-navicode.acura.com/">website</a>. If that doesn't work, call a dealership, ask for parts and services, and tell them you need the code. If they don't give the code or try to charge you, try another dealership.</li>
 <li>If you came from step 1, disconnect the car battery, wait 30 seconds, and reconnect. If not, disconnect the power cable from the car stereo, wait 30 seconds, and reconnect.</li>
 <li>Enter the code</li>
 <li>Celebrate</li>
 </ol>

The theme is Economy. It's an analog game! I'll make a digital game soon...
 
 Rules:
 <ol>
 <li>Each player (vendor) is given a set of n blank cards. N being the number of players or 5 at a minimum.</li>
 <li>Each player draws a single item and duplicates it on all of their cards. Example items: A spaceship, Obama, a Macbook Pro, Excalibur, an empty tin can.</li>
 <li>Each player writes the value of their item on the card. Example values: 1, 1 million, 1/3, 1283, $1.99, pie.</li>
 <li>Each player keeps 5 cards in hand and discards the rest. (This is done so that players can evenly distribute their cards when they get eliminated)</li>
 <li>The player with the highest valued item begins the first turn (barter).</li>
 <li>Turn: The current player must barter with another player. The number of cards exchanged must be equal on both sides. Example barter: "I'll trade 1 spaceship, 2 Obamas, and a Macbook Pro for 3 empty tin cans!". The players exchange cards. The other player must now respond with the new total value of his goods within a time limit [5 seconds]. If the other player succeeds, the game continues. If the other player fails, the player is eliminated and must evenly distribute their cards among the remaining players.</li>
 <li>If a round completes, the time limit decreases by [1 second]. The time limit resets to the default value once a player is eliminated.</li>
 <li>The game continues until 2 players are left. In order for the final player to win, one player must fail a barter and the other player must succeed during the next barter.</li>
 </ol>
 
 Optional Rules:
 Players must role-play as a vendor. Example vendors: the merchant from Resident Evil 4, Crazy Dave from Plants vs Zombies, an ambiguous Middle Eastern vendor.

 How this came about:
 I actually wanted to make a game in Unity but my windows partition had insufficient space, so I started thinking about analog games and new media. The main idea was written during public transport. I worked it out a little more on a composition book. That's it. 591 2012-03-14 02:28:35 2012-03-14 06:28:35 open open ridiculous-vending publish 0 0 post 0 analog game big game Game Development Games math game physical game _wp_old_slug ridiculous-vendin _edit_last 1 What Makes a Game Meaningful and Why Innovative Mechanics Aren't Enough http://rahilpatel.com/blog/what-makes-a-game-meaningful-and-why-innovative-mechanics-arent-enough Sun, 25 Mar 2012 09:10:03 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=661 During the production of my first few game prototypes [September-November 2011], I was inspired to create games with new game mechanics. But now as I am creating this month's EGP game, novel game mechanics are not enough for me. It's not enough to motivate me to continue creating.
 
 I am now gearing towards Jenova Chen's philosophy. Making a game that causes the player to feel a certain way.
 
 Thinking about film for a second, as <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/inspired-by-films-and-everything-else">films have greatly influenced me</a>, I cannot think of an experimental film that greatly affected me. The films that the were meaningful to me, that influenced me, were ones that made me feel differently. [Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind did come to mind]
 
 I can't name many games that directly express a feeling. Most current great games have a novel game mechanic and fit the secondary art (story, graphics, music) around it [in good taste] to express the feeling: Ico (care), Shadow of the Collosus (epicness), Braid (enigmatic). Few games have a more direct approach: Dys4ia (frustration) [IMO, amazing], ...But That Was [Yesterday] (sadness) and Between (lots!). Okay it seems now I'm just naming some of my favorite games. But perhaps that's the reason they are my favorite. They were meaningful because they made me feel a certain way. They moved me.
 
 Isn't that the core of art, an expression of feeling?
 
 What place do purely mechanical games such as (glancing at IGF) Spelunky, Antichamber, Beat Sneak Bandit, The Floor is Jelly, even the mechanically genius Storyteller have? In order for it to be meaningful to me, will these games have be fully developed, realized, harness an emotion for it to have a pronounced affect on me? [Botanicula did make me smile]
 
 I think so. I don't even care about most of those game as of now.
 
 If Braid did not have the story, graphics, level design, and music that it did, would it have been great? I don't think so. It would have just been another puzzle game with cool new mechanics. A forgotten IGF winner for best design. A squander.
 
 The importance of "finishing your game" is reiterated. And by finish, it is implied to develop the game until every aspect is fully thought out, until you've spent years of your life creating something, something that somehow your life now depends on, in hope that it will be equally appreciated by others as it is to you. 661 2012-03-25 05:10:03 2012-03-25 09:10:03 open open what-makes-a-game-meaningful-and-why-innovative-mechanics-arent-enough publish 0 0 post 0 art game emotional games Game Development Games Personal _edit_last 1 _wp_old_slug what-makes-a-game-meaningful _wp_old_slug what-makes-a-game-meaningful-and-how-innovative-mechanics-arent-enough La Planète Sauvage (Fantastic Planet) http://rahilpatel.com/blog/la-planete-sauvage Mon, 26 Mar 2012 09:41:42 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=677 [Old draft, just posting without proofreading.]
 
 Fantastic Planet thoughts while watching:
 First, thought about how great it is as a animal rights movie. Placing humans has pets.
 
 Then I thought about how Jonathan Blow mentioned that he liked to read Calvino because it expands his mind. I agree. The book is fantastic for thinking, creating new ideas, as is this film.
 
 Then I started thinking about how primitive ideas are the core of real world problems. Tribes translate to countries. Who cares about airport security or offices. None of that matters.
 
 Then I thought more about how humans can be compared to insects. They multiply, live in undesirable places
 
 Making something universal as this helps it become timeless.
 
 The film reaks of creativity. Other sci-fi films often have only a few alterations compared to real life. This one never stops. If you were to watch a random clip of the film before seeing the entire film, you wouldn't be able to comprehend what is going on. You would think the film is strictly for hippies. Once put together, it's completely coherent. [Trying to think of others, only Miyazaki comes to mind]
 
 interview with the director:
 Favors ideas over polish.
 He was interested in shadow puppets, and created a film of it with mentally ill patients. That lead to finding an artistic partner, worked on it for 4 years in another country while war was going on, outsourcing work. 677 2012-03-26 05:41:42 2012-03-26 09:41:42 open open la-planete-sauvage publish 0 0 post 0 Film Reviews Films _edit_last 1 _wp_old_slug la-planete-sauvage-fantastic-planet _yoast_wpseo_primary_category medium_post O:11:"Medium_Post":11:{s:16:"author_image_url";s:74:"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/200/200/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png";s:10:"author_url";s:28:"https://medium.com/@rahil627";s:11:"byline_name";N;s:12:"byline_email";N;s:10:"cross_link";s:2:"no";s:2:"id";s:12:"97f06914eb1b";s:21:"follower_notification";s:3:"yes";s:7:"license";s:19:"all-rights-reserved";s:14:"publication_id";s:12:"7a04709b0155";s:6:"status";s:6:"public";s:3:"url";s:82:"https://medium.com/@rahil627/la-plan%C3%A8te-sauvage-fantastic-planet-97f06914eb1b";} _yoast_wpseo_content_score 90 RGBRGBRGB http://rahilpatel.com/blog/rgbrgbrgb Sat, 31 Mar 2012 21:34:38 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=702 <a href="http://rahilpatel.com/rgbrgbrgb.html">Play the game</a>.
 
 This is my entry <a href="http://experimentalgameplay.com/blog/2012/03/economy-in-march-2012/">Experimental Gameplay March 2012</a>. The theme is economy. It is the result of developing a game without thinking about the core game mechanic first. It is a complete failure.

 Player 1/Player 2 - description
 
 A/' - Red
 S/; - Green
 D/L - Blue
 F/K - hold and press RGB to direct military to retreat, halt, and attack
 G/J - hold and press RGB to tell workers to get a specific resource (by default it auto-gathers)
 
 Finger mapping:

 How to play:
 It's just a simple real-time strategy game, except you play with a keyboard. Blue units gather resources, green do nothing as of now [supposed to research/upgrade], red can attack.
 
 Other Notes:
 As of now battles are sad due to lack of solid objects and pathfinding. Also, there is no win condition.
 
 Post thoughts:
 
 What was envisioned:
 1000s of units, flocking, simple yet competitive gameplay (think Hokra), precise controls (think QWOP), color-collar workers (and a statement against classism), resource renewal (and a statement against resource consumption), map based off of image, able to upload map (MS paint is now a map editor!), large resolution to zoom in and out.
 
 Why it didn't work:
 Decreasing the amount of player input increases the amount of AI programming. Competitive games require more balancing and tuning than non-competitive games. Multiplayer on the the same screen isn't as fun because it lacks fog of war.
 
 Also, I felt like crap while making this. It was forced. It just didn't feel right.
 
 Future:
 I feel like a game could be created with these initial ideas, but I can't bare to look at it again. 702 2012-03-31 17:34:38 2012-03-31 21:34:38 open open rgbrgbrgb publish 0 0 post 0 flashpunk Game Design Game Development Game Ideas Games real-time strategy rts _edit_last 1 _wp_old_slug rgbr Designing Educational Games: The Indie Way http://rahilpatel.com/blog/designing-educational-games-the-indie-way Mon, 30 Apr 2012 08:12:51 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=773 I attended the VINCI / Sid the Science Kid hackathon. It turned out to be a startup pitch event for developing an educational game using a VINCI tablet.
 
 After I poorly <a href="#pitches">pitched my game</a>, I had a burning thought, the reason I had to write this post: I felt that the design behind technology in education is poor because of the designer's approach and money.
 
 I imagine when a typical educational game designer thinks of a game, they constrain the game to the limits of what they perceive a kid can do. Thus resulting in worthless passive games (think film with buttons).
 
 I believe that if I was a kid and given any educational game from today, I would have played the game for 5 minutes and trashed it. I would have deemed that the game lacked value. Yep, even as a kid I had values.
 
 Educational game designers could take few points from the current independent game scene. Indie game designers strive to let the player learn to play the game by playing the game, without a tutorial. Indie game designers also try to make a game as accessible as possible, so even a person who hasn't been conditioned to a similar game can play.
 
 I think one approach to this is to take a complex system and try to simplify the interface as much as possible, without losing the core functions. My game is essentially a simplified music composition application. What else can be simplified? How about other creative endeavors: writing a book, making a film, choreographing a dance, designing a house, designing a game. How about occupations: forensic scientist, nurse, documentarian, journalist, photographer.
 
 The other problem is sadly money. If money already greatly influences the American education system, then it surely affects technology in education. The existence of a poorly marketed two-day $80,000 prize startup pitch event perfectly demonstrates the influence.
 
 The end result: an indie game developer rants and another terrible educational game is funded.
 
 <h2>The Pitches</h2>
 I pitched two ideas, one with a team and one without.
 
 The team pitch development started with many great ideas but became something monstrous and out of scope. Still, I don't regret teaming up. I feel that having a team enforces the result product to be more accessible. My personal pitch is clearly a product of my personality, and likely only works for my kind.
 
 My personal pitch was for a game in which the player draws to create music. The x-axis is time and y-axis is pitch. The game has pre-defined sounds it can recognize and indicates the player once found. For example, if the player draws a stick figure, the game recognizes and indicates the vertical line used for the body as a clap sound. The clap sound is now marked as discovered under a list of sounds. Perhaps there's a sound below that for applause (with a play button beside it to play it). Now, since the player knows how to create a clapping sound, he may intuitively draw multiple vertical lines to create an applause sound. In the process, the player will learn how the game works and go on to try to mimic the other sounds listed.
 
 The possible features are exactly those of any professional music making program. Colors (different instruments), sound recording, save composition function, etc. I imagine the core sounds would progress: make a crescendo, a decrescendo, a siren sound (wave), jingle bells (without pitch), jingle bells (with pitch).
 
 I doubt my game will be chosen. It requires too much development time; It's not feasible. The judges likely feel it's too complex for a 5 year old. Yet, of all of the pitches, the only game I'd actually want to develop is my own.
 
 UPDATE:
 The team I was on won, but the misrepresentation of the prizes and the misorganization of the development process steered me away. 773 2012-04-30 04:12:51 2012-04-30 08:12:51 open open designing-educational-games-the-indie-way publish 0 0 post 0 educational games Game Development Games independent games pitch San Francisco startup startup pitch startup pitch event _edit_last 1 _yoast_wpseo_primary_category medium_post O:11:"Medium_Post":11:{s:16:"author_image_url";s:74:"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/200/200/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png";s:10:"author_url";s:28:"https://medium.com/@rahil627";s:11:"byline_name";N;s:12:"byline_email";N;s:10:"cross_link";s:2:"no";s:2:"id";s:12:"d1ecbd22e2a9";s:21:"follower_notification";s:3:"yes";s:7:"license";s:19:"all-rights-reserved";s:14:"publication_id";s:2:"-1";s:6:"status";s:6:"public";s:3:"url";s:83:"https://medium.com/@rahil627/designing-educational-games-the-indie-way-d1ecbd22e2a9";} Pinkies Up http://rahilpatel.com/blog/pinkies-up Tue, 15 May 2012 12:12:45 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=1406 <h2>Game Files</h2>

 <h2>Design Statement</h2>
 As Jon often describes the game to others, “it’s basically flip-cup for iPad”.
 <p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_8911.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-1411 aligncenter" src="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_8911-1024x557.jpg" alt="IMG_8911" width="496" height="270" /></a></p>
 Two teams race, each team having a quirky physics based character code-named Harold. Each player is assigned one button. Each active player group must press their buttons in sequence to add force to Harold. A button pressed out of sequence causes Harold to physically collapse, stopping him for a moment. First Harold to the finish line, which is at the end of the screen of the last device, wins.
 
 <h2>Intentions</h2>
 A social extensible-multiplayer iPad game with a simple interface. It’s what Jon and I had been gravitating toward for the previous few months.
 
 We intended to maximize the use of iPad’s features: eleven touches, physics, and networking. Oh the possibilities! A single parallax scrolling background over multiple devices as Harold runs across the screen, UI color palettes and silly sounds for each device.
 Personal Contribution
 The game is Jon’s idea, which constitutes a large portion of the game design. We collaborated to etch out further game design. I programmed everything except the physics of Harold. Jon also handled visual design.
 
 <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
 The greatest problem with development was the lack of consistent playtesting. Consistent playtesting is needed to see progress and priority, but also to maintain motivation. A related problem: we were working remotely. Being physically together is important.
 
 I also underestimated the time it takes to write code for Objective-C, Cocos2d, Box2d, and Game Kit. It was at least five times slower than writing code for my previously used game engine: FlashPunk. I also felt that my networking code was poorly written. It takes time.
 
 The lack of feedback caused motivation to wane, and the work sits on my computer, teasing me. Perhaps I just need to bring it out, playtest it to regain motivation, and finish it. 1406 2012-05-15 08:12:45 2012-05-15 12:12:45 open closed pinkies-up publish 0 0 post 0 Game Design Game Development Game Ideas Games _edit_last 1 _yoast_wpseo_primary_category medium_post O:11:"Medium_Post":11:{s:16:"author_image_url";s:74:"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/200/200/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png";s:10:"author_url";s:28:"https://medium.com/@rahil627";s:11:"byline_name";N;s:12:"byline_email";N;s:10:"cross_link";s:2:"no";s:2:"id";s:12:"d27aae075692";s:21:"follower_notification";s:3:"yes";s:7:"license";s:19:"all-rights-reserved";s:14:"publication_id";s:2:"-1";s:6:"status";s:6:"public";s:3:"url";s:52:"https://medium.com/@rahil627/pinkies-up-d27aae075692";} A Reply to My Sister About Blogs http://rahilpatel.com/blog/a-reply-to-my-sister-about-blogs Sat, 14 Apr 2012 15:43:46 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=2015 <blockquote>Hah, you're way more excited about this then I am.

 My gripe about blogs is that I find 99% of them useless, including my own. I've never followed a blog, I've only stumbled upon specific well-written posts by people that I admire. If "how to hold a hamburger properly" was chosen to be "freshly pressed" then I deem Wordpress's standards for content is low, aiming for popularity instead of quality. I don't seek popularity; I only care for those few people who actually searched specifically for something I wrote.
 
 Again, blogging is my lowest priority. Before I can write anything, I have to create/do something first.

 Overcome body influences
 Overcome time management
 Overcome the system
 Overcome the fear of doing
 Overcome the fear of doing something large
 
 Control body, time

 Do it with integrity
 
 Preface. The following steps are meaningless as any self help book. It is merely a gauge. To learn, you must do it yourself. A large shortcut to a lot of it is to live alone with just two bags.
 
 Hmmm, it may be that the reason I cannot make something large is my lack of leadership. I need to overcome communication. I need to be able to choose my group and lead to success.
 
 It would have just been easier if I had a great mentor to follow.

 Humor from elderly people is almost always universal from my experience. Everyone probably has a humorous uncle that's able to make the whole family laugh.
 
 I personally wouldn't ever want to create something targeted to a specific audience. For example, I wouldn't want to create an movie based on a manga, which is likely targeted at the Japanese and Otaku population. I'd want to create a Miyazaki film. I don't even think of anime when Miyazaki comes to mind. Yet, Miyazaki's films possess many common characteristics of anime. Why? Because his work is universal; It's able to reach to everyone.
 
 This thought reminds me of when Jenova Chen mentioned wanting to create an experience that is as universal as Miyazaki.
 
 Another example of universalism in art is Pokemon. Pokemon do not conform to any culture. They are creatures, quite different from real animals, having somewhat unique names (maybe they mean something in Japanese?). My mom doesn't know anything about the show but when she hears "pikachu" in Ash's pikachu's voice, she associates it with the pokemon in her mind. That's powerful. I believe the reason Pokemon was a success is because it is universal.
 
 The same goes for many Disney films, and other things often revered by the public -- The Godfather, Shawshank Redemption, Michael Jackson, The Beatles, Marvin Gaye, etc.
 
 Universalism is achieved by avoiding references, cliches, and things that would limit the audience.
 
 <strong>A digression:</strong>
 Hmm. Perhaps a method to create something universal is to figure out how to introduce something innovative to the broadest audience. Finding something specific in the world that you think is beautiful, and trying to show it to the world by making it more accessible.
 
 Yeah. That sounds like the virtue of commercial art. Fine art doesn't care for everyone else. It's a little more pretentious.
 
 I guess it's a choice. Should one strive to create something universal (commercial) or not (fine)? I guess that's up to the artist. Sometime's it's nice to have positive feedback from the public, instead of that 1% who actually understand the importance of those things in museums. 812 2012-05-27 11:34:54 2012-05-27 15:34:54 open open universalism-in-art publish 0 0 post 0 Aesthetics Art Film Reviews Personal Philosophy _edit_last 1 _yoast_wpseo_primary_category medium_post O:11:"Medium_Post":11:{s:16:"author_image_url";s:74:"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/200/200/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png";s:10:"author_url";s:28:"https://medium.com/@rahil627";s:11:"byline_name";N;s:12:"byline_email";N;s:10:"cross_link";s:2:"no";s:2:"id";s:12:"4a6723673015";s:21:"follower_notification";s:3:"yes";s:7:"license";s:19:"all-rights-reserved";s:14:"publication_id";s:2:"-1";s:6:"status";s:6:"public";s:3:"url";s:61:"https://medium.com/@rahil627/universalism-in-art-4a6723673015";} Taiwan: First Impressions http://rahilpatel.com/blog/taiwan-first-impressions Mon, 15 Oct 2012 17:46:17 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=874 [Old draft, posting anyway. More like a journal entry, but contains lots of shallow observations of Taiwanese people. It's quite important to know that I lived in America my entire life before coming to Taiwan.]
 
 <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
 This is completely subjective. Stereotypes are made.
 
 <h2>Taiwanese people are happy</h2>
 Taiwanese people are overall happy. Check the happy index on Wikipedia. All classes of society are happy. Not faking happy for the face of the company they work for. Real happiness.
 
 Taiwanese people are very friendly. I thought perhaps it was my brown baby face, but the other hostel travelers agree. We've all had many situations in which a person went out of their way to help. One of the hostel travelers, Floor, watched fireworks for Valentine's day that occurred at a nearby river. When it was over, a family asked if he had dessert, they then proceeded to take him out to a desert shop that sold shaved ice with mango, and even paid for it. Another hostel traveler needed directions once and was given a ride on a scooter to their destination. I've similarly been helped several times. Just on the first day, I had trouble finding my hostel at night. I asked two kids pushing a closed food cart. They didn't know where, but they asked others and eventually found it. Another time, I asked for a certain bus station, a girl took five minutes to walk me to it. Furthermore, the bus driver insisted I didn't pay and made sure I got out at the right stop. Yet another time, I was asked by a mother of a family of three to join them for dinner, then out for a day trip the next day. All of this within my first week in Taipei.
 
 Typhoons come, people make mistakes, they forgive and they forget.
 
 Nearly all of Taiwan is developed, yet ambition and competition is low, which is surprising for a developed country.
 
 <h2>Taiwanese people are more organized, courteous, and protective</h2>
 Taiwanese (and likely other East Asian) people are organized and courteous. On escalators, people who want to stand stay on the right side, people who want to walk, on the left. I've never seen anyone block a pathway. The same organization applies to vehicular traffic. I once saw a scooter get nudged by a mini pickup truck. The scooter curved off direction, stopped, looked back at the offending vehicle, then moved on. He shrugged off the incident as if it were a baby that dropped food.
 
 Taiwanese people (and likely Asians in general) can sometimes be overly neat or organized. People wore raincoats during the water rapids ride. An entire family. They wanted to ride but didn't want the inconvenience of getting wet.
 
 I thought about how my friend described Japanese subways. How extremely organized the people are. The train is packed yet no one makes a noise out of the courtesy of others. Japanese people (and likely other East Asians) care about others. They understand people are tired from work, and perhaps even expect the same from others. I haven't been on a Japanese subway, but I think I would become bored of such routinely commute. I'd wish for a Black American to be there. To make some noise. Add some excitement to it. Living in a homogeneous country, one appreciates diversity.
 
 Two travelers from the hostel, Vidit and Floor told stories of their times in Korea in which there is a beach near Busan where there are buoys and helicopters to make sure Koreans do not pass a certain distance.
 
 When the day market is over, the store owners clean their store front, and even the space around them, together, like a community. The same occurs when the night market is over. The same occurs, when the trash truck comes.
 
 <em>The trash truck</em>
 The trash truck deserves an essay of it's own. Taiwanese homeowners don't leave their trash out to rot. They keep it until the trash truck comes. The truck drives slowly around neighborhoods, and people are expected to bring the trash to it in a timely manner. When it comes, an American may mistake for an ice cream truck. It plays music, similar to the music that is played when school children are to clean up. People come out to throw their trash in the truck. There's a recycling bin and liquid waste bin too. The whole event is surprisingly communal. Neighbors come out, often hilariously chasing down the truck in their nightwear and flip flops. It's a moment of the day I cherish.
 
 Gladly, Taiwanese people are still quite balanced. Taiwanese people remind me of the people of San Francisco, where people are also happy and will take time to help others, but likely have more money and fit the young professional category. In Taiwan, these good characteristics apply to all classes of society.
 
 <h2>Media influence</h2>
 The influence of media is astounding.
 
 Like moths to a light bulb people are attracted to what is marketed to them. They take pictures of movie posters with their iPhones and upload to Facebook for their friends to see, not thinking about the films they could make with it. They play games on their smartphones during transportation, missing an opportunity to talk to a very interesting person in front of them.
 
 Night markets rise every night in every area. People shop. It's often the same items everywhere, yet people still browse and buy things. It's natural; Consuming is a necessity of life.
 
 Yet, I often felt that the consumption of the youth is quite high. Bubble tea, colorful clothes, giant fried chickens. Kids come out and enjoy. Many work at the night market, some with their parents. Or perhaps this is my perception because I was traveling and not living. I've been to a lot of night markets myself and enjoyed eating a stick of five boiled quail eggs and drinking a papaya milk shake. An alternative social scene? I've become tried of night markets, but if I were meeting some friends for a quick bite, it's quite convenient. It's fun.
 
 <h2>Taiwanese people are healthy</h2>
 There are very few fat people in Taiwan, yet they seemingly eat all the time, 5 or more meals a day. It's so hot and humid I never feel like eating. When I do, it's either meat or sugar, usually in the form of fried meat and tea.
 
 Taiwanese people will tell you if you are fat. It’s not rude. It’s a problem that can be fixed. I love it.
 
 <h2>JV's Hostel</h2>
 [move to another more personal post]
 I was a little apprehensive about the hostel. Everyone was so relaxed. I felt like an outsider. But the next day, I found it was just my perspective. And by the end of my second day, it felt like home.
 
 The experiences I had during my stay at this hostel, my first days of travel, were some of the greatest moments in my life. It reminded what living is.
 
 The people here were outstanding, the staff and the travelers.
 
 The staff consisted of the pleasant owner and three girls working part-time during summer vacation. They lived fast pace lives, going to places, doing things, consuming, Facebooking, having a blast. They took the travelers out to places to eat, things to do, making sure everyone was having as much fun as they were. They're all smart too; two went to SFSU and were continuing studies in Taiwan. I was able to get close to one, have conversations about sociology, Taiwan, the Asian mentality, and life in general.
 
 The crowd was diverse. In just three days I've met people from the Netherlands, Shanghai, Seoul, Arizona, The Bay Area, India, and Sweden.
 
 One guy from the Netherlands seems to work for a few months to get money, then go out to travel again. One was there to renew a Korean visa while teaching there. Three girls from Korea were travelling Taipei for a week. One guy from Germany was seemingly wasting away. One girl from Berlin shared interests in contemporary writers, the contemporary art scene in big cities, and making bubble sculptures. One guy from US was able to find an English teaching job, find an apartment, and basically begin a new life. One guy from Guangzhou had the time of his life, thoroughly enjoying every moment away from his apparently boring life in China with restrictive parents. One girl found a job at a pet store and quit once she found out there were more dogs in smaller cages in the back of the store. One Australian guy was able to speak Chinese fluently, doing exchange for his language studies. 
 
 During the time there, I didn't feel right. I was consuming as opposed to creating. I was becoming someone whom I previously despised, a mindless consumer. I was consuming too much. Yet, in hindsight, staying at this hostel is something I miss dearly and will never forget. The people I met here were all amazing. It was quickly apparent that my travels had to be about meeting people.
 
 <h2>Taipei</h2>
 I was surprised at how Taipei is to New York, or any other city. The same personalities, classes, consumerism, markets, etc. I think once you've lived in a city, a rural area, and a suburb, you've lived everywhere.
 
 It's also surprising how easy it is to travel in a place where everything is written in a foreign language, and everyone speaks in a foreign language. The design of the metro system maps are very similar to any other. Color coded, designed well enough to understand. English where it's necessary.
 
 I had a difficult time the first day, but the next day was somehow easier. All I needed to do was figure out how to get from the hostel to the main street on which the metro is. The street signs are difficult to find, so I remember by landmarks. Many times I don't know the landmark, but remember the sight once I see it. A smartphone isn't necessary; It's a little more fun to find the way to the destination asking people nearby to help, but it's also a waste of time when you need to be somewhere.
 
 Downtowns are all the same -- big businesses, big banks, big brand shopping centers, big chain restaurants, but that's not all there is in a city.
 
 Taipei is a microcosm of Taiwan. You can find everything you want from Taiwan here, or very close to it. Really, there's a hot spring a little north, the beach a little further, a mountain to the southeast, shops, neighborhoods. It's not as exciting as going to Guanziling hot spring, or Alishan, and it doesn't quite have the charm and pleasant weather of the east coast, but it's enough.
 
 If you've been to a city, one could feel that there isn't much. It's mostly shopping and eating. I'm not going to complete tourist destinations either. The city is repetitive; Night markets, giant malls of popular designers, random temples. Even other travelers at the hostel agree that there isn't much to see.
 
 Once I digested the new things to me in Taiwan, my narrow interests to contemporary art events: an exhibition at the Museum of Contemporary Art, a performance at the Digital Art Center, an indie music and film festival at an abandoned building near the last subway stop to the east, and a playing of Metropolis at Huashan park with live music from an electronic duo from Europe. The city's contemporary art may not be as ambitious as New York, but it exists. Taiwan National University is the center of it, and venues and artist villages exist in Taipei. A friend mentioned the only other city with art is Kaohsiung, still, it doesn't compare to Taipei.
 
 <h2> West coast; more cities</h2>
 ...
 
 <h2> East coast</h2>
 ...
 
 <h2>Other / temporary</h2>
 Of course, this is my perception. A person who's lived a secluded life and then began living a normal life once I started travelling. Competitive by nature.

 This post is an ongoing list of travel tips, resources, and a pre-travel checklist. It was written because a friend asked for some tips and my response turned out to be very long, so long that I felt the effort belonged to a more permanent, more public place, like this blog.
 
 Obligatory disclaimer: somethings written here are subjective and it's up to you to extract whatever you can from it. Actually, you should just stop researching and just go!
 
 <h3>Checklist</h3>
 I hate packing, but gladly, very little is necessary.
 
 smartphone - It's nearly everything one needs to travel. It's a map, (Google maps), a compass, an internet browser, a camera, a video camera, a hotspot, an alarm clock, an e-book reader, and more.
 check passport expiration date
 check visa
 limit bag weight to 20kg check-in and 7kg carry-on
 call or use internet to inform debit and credit card companies of travels so that they do not block the card upon foreign transactions
 check driver's license expiration date
 check international driver's license expiration date
 download and install everything you need (internet is going to suck)
 composition book
 notes application
 inform embassy of travels through <a href="https://step.state.gov/STEP">Smart Traveller Enrollment Program</a> (STEP)
 - it sends current news through e-mail about the areas you are travelling to
 otc stomach medicine (Pepto-Bismal)
 mosquito spray
 sun screen
 become an EU citizen
 - able to live and work in 28 countries?
 
 <h3>Pro-tips</h3>
 Pros only.
 
 Don't reserve accommodation.
 Don't buy ongoing or return flights. Kinda risky? Can buy a "ghost" ticket.
 Don't bring more than one backpack and daypack.
 
 <h3>Visas</h3>
 Oh if only every country handled this the same. Some countries have weird stipulations: Thailand allows 30 days by air, but only 15 by land. Also, make sure the visa is stamped upon entry and exit. Laos duped me; Luckily, I didn't have any cash to give them and they let me out.
 
 <a href="http://travel.state.gov/">Travel.State.Gov</a> - for U.S. citizens, choose country, check the entry / exit requirements section
 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visa_requirements_for_United_States_citizens">Visa requirements for United States citizens Wikipedia article</a> - easy to view, but may not be updated
 
 Country specific:
 <a href="http://www.forumosa.com/taiwan/viewtopic.php?f=35&t=103343">Taiwan</a> - a post that explains how ARCs, work permits, and visas work
 
 Working holiday visas:
 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_holiday_visa">Wikipedia article</a>
 - US does not participate in this
 - "There are opportunities for US citizens to work in Ireland, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea under similar bilateral programs, however."
 
 <h3>Transportation</h3>
 <h4>Air Travel</h4>
 I used a combination of <a href="http://kayak.com/">Kayak</a> and <a href="http://www.skyscanner.com/">Skyscanner</a>. Skyscanner will find some funky cheap domestic flights that Kayak will miss. If the trip is short you may not need to book in advance to get a good rate. Flights through small airlines can be surprisingly cheap, like $20 flights to the Philippines through Cebu Pacific from nearby countries. I should give <a href="https://www.hipmunk.com/">Hipmunk</a> another try.
 
 <h4>Motorcycle</h4>
 I'd recommend riding a bike anywhere road conditions are somewhat decent. Motorcycles are the best form of transportation. No need to follow bus and train schedules, not limited to the developed towns public transportation goes; Swerve into random villages; Few things feel better than being on a motorcycle. If you can, buy a bike, make an overland trip, and sell it at the end.
 
 Make sure to get an international driver's permit with a motorcycle stamp. It could be helpful to just get one without a motorcycle license. I was able to rent motorcycles throughout SE Asia with just a normal vehicle driver's license, and sometimes just a passport.
 
 <h3>Accommodation</h3>
 I used hostelbookers and hostelworld for more popular places. I never had to reserve a hostel, even during travelling season. Great hostels can make a huge difference. It could mean having helpful and knowledgable staff members, meeting interesting travelers, integrating with local people, having a lower chance of items being stolen. Hostels are an experience of their own. I've had really memorable times in them.
 
 <a href="http://www.hostelbookers.com/">hostelbookers</a> - no fee for reservation, more technical user interface
 <a href="http://www.hostelworld.com/">hostelworld</a> - charges fee for reservation, better user interface
 <a href="http://www.tripadvisor.com/">tripadvisor</a> - more than just hostels
 <a href="http://www.hostels.com/">hostels</a> - just hostels, really
 
 <h3>Couchsurfing</h3>
 Although it can serve as accommodation, it's about meeting people and culture exchange, therefore it deserves it's own category.
 
 I <a href="https://www.couchsurfing.org/">couchsurfed</a> a few times in Taiwan and loved it. I usually don't feel like planning anything and want to wander about. Living through someone else is one the laziest and thus my favorite way to travel. It just requires some time ahead to communicate and set dates. If you have the time to plan, I highly recommend it.
 
 <h3>Work</h3>
 Oh so much to do. Just choose and go!
 
 <h4>Volunteering and Work Exchange</h4>
 I highly recommend this too. Travelling too fast is detrimental to social life, unless you're able to control yourself and Skype with friends and family at home frequently. Living in one place, developing relationships. It's just good.
 
 I also didn't want to tie myself to an ESL gig for 6 months or a year, so instead I found an English teaching position on helpx for two weeks, which turned into two months.
 
 Both sites are about the same. You can see helpx posts without paying. Workaway requires you to pay before seeing.
 
 <a href="http://www.helpx.net/">helpx</a>
 <a href="http://www.workaway.info/">workaway</a>
 
 <a href="http://www.wwoof.org/">WWOOF</a> - limited to organic farming
 
 <h4>English as a Second Language (ESL)</h4>
 Teaching English is a financially safe and logistically easy way to live in another country. A lot of people do this. Although safe and easy, it's a real job that takes time and effort, 30-40+ hours a week. I believe you should try to do what you want. Be bold. Never compromise for financial safety.
 
 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teaching_English_as_a_foreign_language">Wikipedia article</a>
 
 <h3>Communication</h3>
 The cheapest route is to just use an online service. If people need to contact you on demand, get a local or international SIM card, which should have free incoming calls. Of course, a GSM phone is needed.
 
 Google Voice - voice over IP service. I ported my number to it before travelling, but I believe they give out free numbers too. My number is from the US, so I am able to use it to call US to US for free. Costs $20 to port my number. It worked with Verizon. About $0.02/minute to mobile devices in other countries. [todo: can I call my Google Voice number from a foreign phone, and relay a call?]
 Talkatone - an iPhone app to make calls through Google Voice
 Skype - free voice over IP service including video and instant messaging
 Facetime - also free voice over IP service including video?
 Prepaid SIM cards - can be really cheap, has free incoming call
 - <a href="http://www.forumosa.com/taiwan/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=103629">Taiwan</a>
 - Thailand
 - DTAC - $20 per month for unlimited 3G data which I heavily tethered. It was amazing.
 International SIM cards - World SIM, OneSimCard, TravelSim. I haven't tried these, but it seems enticing for an all-in-one solution.
 - India
 - Airtel - I bought the 3GB then unlimited plan, tethered it a few times, and still haven't used it up. It's fast. I don't know how slow it will become once I use up the 3GB.
 
 <h3>Finance</h3>
 I'm broke. You probably shouldn't listen to me here.
 
 <h4>Purchases</h4>
 Use a credit card without foreign transaction fees when possible. If not, use cash. Avoid Dynamic Currency Conversion (DCC) -- When a merchant asks to convert to your currency, say no, charge in the current currency you're purchasing from.
 
 Visa and mastercard exchange rates are much lower than banks, and much much lower than airports and hotels. 0.15% to 1.00% according to Visa's website.
 
 Credit card rewards programs are gibberish. I calculated that a 2% cash-back card trumps most travel cards, and it's more convenient.
 
 <h4>Withdrawals</h4>
 Check the foreign transaction fee on your debit or ATM cards. Call your company, ask them if they can waive it during your trip. If not, try to get one without a fee. It's usually 1%, 2%, 3%, or $5. Smaller banks have better rates.
 
 Currency exchange rates:
 <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=exchange+rate">Google</a>
 <a href="http://corporate.visa.com/pd/consumer_services/consumer_ex_rates.jsp">Visa</a>
 <a href="https://www.mastercard.com/global/currencyconversion/index.html">MasterCard</a>
 
 <h3>Vaccinations</h3>
 Call your physician and use health insurance. Call your local public health department and use health insurance. Travel clinics should be the last choice, as they are the most expensive and often do not use health insurance.

 <h4>Antimalarials</h4>
 For long-term, the intake any antimalarials will likely display side effects. Taking none and avoiding mosquito bites seems like the best option. It's not worth the side effects or money. It's possibly overblown by overly cautious Westerners and drug companies. Besides, it's curable.
 
 For short-term, Atovaquone / Proguanil seems like the best option. Can use Cholorquine in areas where mosquitos are not resistant to it.
 
 I'm not sure if it's okay to change medicine.
 
 Chloroquine:
 Cheap. Low side effects, and family uses it without problems. Resisted in many areas.
 
 Atovaquone/Proguanil (Malarone, Malanil):
 Expensive ($4/daily pill). Low side effects. Difficult to find in non-industrialized countries.
 
 Doxycycline:
 Cheap. Tetracyclines are a general antibiotic which works against several diseases. Might be causing me digestion problems.
 
 Mefloquine:
 Kinda scary to me, as it has psychological and neurological side effects. The local doctor prescribed me this, but I'll likely cancel it.

 My experience:
 I took one before going to North Thailand, and I don't recommend it. I don't think it's worth, in side effects and cost, taking any anti-malarial for long-term travelling.
 
 I started taking Doxycycline once I knew I was going to bike through northwest Thailand. The medicine had few side effects and was noted as a helpful general antibiotic. It was causing indigestion and heartburn by the time I got to India. I think it was also screwing up my taste.
 
 My family take Choloquine, and they say that they never had problems with it. It didn't make sense to take that medicine either as the mosquitos in India are resistant to it.

It turned out to be a really interesting experiment.
 
 <h2>Experiment Results</h2>
 Despite them being a little uncreative, they enjoyed all of the games. The only problem was I had to guide them a bit on learning how to play each game. I would say they enjoyed the games in the following order: Fingle, Shot Shot Shoot, Singing Fingers, SpellTower.
 
 Fingle, by far, was a winner. They quickly learned (with guidance, and the constant enforcement of the using one hand rule) and said, "this would be fun to play with a girl". Still, the two male kids enjoyed playing. They laughed at the sound of moaning after accomplishing a level. I feel the game worked because it doesn't require much creativity from them. There is a clear goal, and they do it.
 
 Shot Shot Shoot was fun. When I played against either one of them, I won 90% of the time because they just didn't have the capacity for building a strategy. When they played each other, they were reckless. They cared about winning, but there was little to no learning going on.
 
 Singing fingers was short lived. After I taught them the mechanics of Singing Fingers by demonstration "helooooo", they mimicked me and said "hellooooo" and then nearly closed it. I then showed them that they could make sounds of different pitches and play them in a tune or simultaneously. Then they got excited. Still, that only extended the gameplay another two minutes for them.
 
 SpellTower went pretty well too, but I think they just lacked English vocabulary. That and puzzle games just aren't fun. Okay, this is a personal bias. I don't play puzzle games. Some people love Tetris, Lumines, and Super Puzzle Fighter; My brain turns off while playing them. I'll consider this game as disqualified.
 
 <h2>What happened?</h2>
 Without a goal, some people will stop playing and move on to something else. Maybe they lack attention, don't care, or just aren't curious enough. In order for a game to be popular, the idea has to click within the first minute, or else they'll move on to something else.
 
 This is a problem. Hugely popular social network games tackled this by adding hand-holding tutorials in the form of dialog boxes. Independent game designers emerged and said tutorial are stupid and that the player should learn by playing. I imagine the direct contrast to those old social network games is Shadow of the Colossus. That game nearly has no directions. It asks the player to figure out what to do, by, well, playing!
 
 None of the games I playtested were learned by the players by themselves. I allowed time for each game, but none of them captured their attention long enough. They simply asked what they should do. Sometimes they touched anything that resembled "Okay" until they came to a screen had enough things moving to resemble a game screen (was this conditioned by social network games?). Once there, they touched a few times, gave up, and closed the game.
 
 Sure, teaching people how to play defeats the purpose of play, but should a line be drawn between the curious, patient, and intelligent people from the rest or should game designers strive to teach everyone?
 
 Even after I taught the kids the basis of each game they struggled to progress in each one. No strategy was created in Shot Shot Shoot and no creativity existed in Singing Fingers. Fingle however was played until they had to leave.
 
 <h2>What does this mean?</h2>
 I think this playtest kinda revived mechanical games for me. Fingle is amazing, simply for its mechanics. Once the basics are learned, the players know how to play the game entirely. New mechanics are not progressively added, so the players are not constantly learning, and so a constant tutorial is not needed. You put the solid white block in the dashed white outline (another sexual metaphor?). Progress is shown through levels rather than mechanics. Sure, there wasn't major thinking or learning going on, but they had fun. Mechanically-heavy digital games, like the board games that precede it have a universal audience. That's kinda powerful. 966 2013-02-26 15:24:35 2013-02-26 20:24:35 open closed an-analysis-of-a-playtest-on-kids publish 0 0 post 0 Game Development Games _wp_old_slug thoughts-afterplaytesting-a-few-games-on-kids-from-less-developed-countries _edit_last 1 _yoast_wpseo_primary_category medium_post O:11:"Medium_Post":11:{s:16:"author_image_url";s:74:"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/200/200/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png";s:10:"author_url";s:28:"https://medium.com/@rahil627";s:11:"byline_name";N;s:12:"byline_email";N;s:10:"cross_link";s:2:"no";s:2:"id";s:12:"5a35b434935b";s:21:"follower_notification";s:3:"yes";s:7:"license";s:19:"all-rights-reserved";s:14:"publication_id";s:2:"-1";s:6:"status";s:6:"public";s:3:"url";s:131:"https://medium.com/@rahil627/an-analysis-of-a-playtest-on-kids-and-thoughts-about-designing-games-for-a-large-audience-5a35b434935b";} Using Scribblenauts as a Teaching Device http://rahilpatel.com/blog/using-scribblenauts-as-a-teaching-device Thu, 18 Apr 2013 22:53:28 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=986 A family friend of mine in India has been using my iPad to use Facebook for the past two days. He's in high school. I think he's got the gist of Facebook, which is better than his Google skills and his concept of the internet. In the past, I let him <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/an-analysis-of-a-playtest-on-kids" title="An analysis of a playtest on kids and thoughts about designing games for a large audience">play a few games on it</a>. Just now, I showed him Scribblenauts Remix. It was an interesting experience.
 
 He doesn't know English well and his spelling is very poor. I didn't know this until he spelled boy "boiii" and ball "bol". I had play with him: to teach him how to play, to translate the goal of each level, to talk about how to solve each level, to help spell out his solutions, and to help deal with the poor game interactions. Although I was guiding him through the game, there was a constant stream of new content: a new English word (axe, ladder), a new object (masquerade mask), a new concept (evolution, extinction events). In parallel, there was a constant stream of learning taking place. The game naturally brought up discussions about the new content, mistranslations, and puzzle solutions. Playing this game turned out to be a really fun teaching experience.
 
 I think this game makes for an awesome teaching device. I totally recommend playing it with any child or foreign teenager, or anyone who wants to learn some English vocabulary! Super Scribblenauts and Scribblenauts Unlimited add adjectives to the game, making it an even better English learning device. 986 2013-04-18 18:53:28 2013-04-18 22:53:28 open closed using-scribblenauts-as-a-teaching-device publish 0 0 post 0 Game Development Games Philosophy of Education _edit_last 1 Creativity Derives from Nothing http://rahilpatel.com/blog/creativity-derives-from-nothing Tue, 30 Apr 2013 17:03:42 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=1021 Also see <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/philosophy-from-media-versus-life-new-york-versus-the-world" title="Philosophy from Media versus Life; New York versus the World">Philosophy from Media versus Life; New York versus the World</a>.
 
 <blockquote>In the past, whenever I watched a great film, I worked harder, my ambitions grew, it cleared my head of all of the silly small things, like a good scooter ride. It kept me in direction, and that direction is creating great films. But isn't that because I'm consuming it? Copying. Creating what I'm consuming. That's wrong, isn't it? Is it right to copy something you love?
 <cite>[by looking at the revisions, it seems that I added this quote a year later, probably while going through my thoughts files and matching quotes to posts]</cite>
 </blockquote>
 
 Creativity. Creating something. How does one create something? Well, it's easy to create something like something else, just copy, but that's not very creative. I think the amount of creativity could be measured by how dissimilar it is to everything else, and is probably how fine art is judged. How does one create something like nothing else? How does on achieve pure creativity?
 
 If one's resulting creations aren't very creative, then perhaps the creative process was affected by one's experience with the medium. Consuming media does not always affect creativity positively. A person who has vast knowledge in fine art does not make one more creative than one who does not. The consumption of art may affect the person negatively, as the person may be more inclined to create something like something they really like, or copy.
 
 A recurring thought I've had: If one lived in humanly sustainable vacuum, a world where there is very little, that person would be extremely creative.
 
 In the past, I stayed up late nights, consumed lots of media, avoided normal life activities, replacing them with films. As a result, I spoiled myself with fine art. For example, I wanted to create films with social realism, in a contemporary foreign setting, with long takes, and other characteristics I liked in art films. I also wanted to avoid things I disliked in pop films. Although I have taste, I like and dislike certains things, I don't think it positively affected my creativity. Perhaps I now know what I want to make and what I don't want to make, but avoiding the consumption of films altogether I wouldn't have to avoid anything, and I wouldn't be copying anyone, and it would have resulted in a better creation.
 
 Now, after consuming very little media while travelling, then glancing at media, I find everything extremely uncreative in every aspect. I wonder why anyone would make such a thing. Of course, I know this because I consumed a lot of media in the past, I know what exists, but still, I feel a huge difference in the amount of creativity of media.
 
 For example, I just listened to "Long. Live. A$AP" after not listening to music for some time. I felt that it's crazy how limited the rap music is. Only Western people can understand the references. The sounds are generated from popular drum machines. I wouldn't ever want to limit myself to a certain culture, or especially a genre. A thought is resurfaces: creativity is affected by your recent surroundings. A temporary solution: live in places where artists don't live.
 
 Consumption is a necessity in life. Travelling is a form of consumption. Instead of consuming art, I think it's better to consume life. Explore places, eat something new, cook something new, play with friends, tend to family, explore people's minds, create relationships, deepen relationships, create something with others, consume something with others, talk to people, observe nature, try a new job, try a new hobby, learn a new language. Live life, then create something from it. Perhaps these are the greatest derivatives of creativity: personal experiences.
 
 In order to achieve pure creativity, one must remind oneself to do the following: starve oneself from art (at least the medium), start from nothing (or something minute), and live life. Then, create something from it. 1021 2013-04-30 13:03:42 2013-04-30 17:03:42 open closed creativity-derives-from-nothing publish 0 0 post 0 Art Personal _edit_last 1 _yoast_wpseo_primary_category Life and Technology http://rahilpatel.com/blog/life-and-technology Tue, 30 Jul 2013 18:10:10 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=1096 Humans have <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_human_needs">fundamental human needs</a>. People in undeveloped countries live the same as the people in developed countries do, the only difference is the environment, including money, and with money comes the prevalence of technology.
 
 Technology reduces and sometimes entirely replaces work in developed countries. Touting is replaced by internet and television advertisements. Launderers are replaced by laundry machines. Convenience stores replaced by vending machines. The person on the bus who takes your money and yells the bus's destination is replaced by a transportation card system and electronic marquee. Furthermore, buses and bus drivers are replaced by a metro station with even more electronic stuff. Perhaps transportation will be replaced by teleporters or apparition.
 
 The reduction of work saves people time and energy. That's great, but technology reduces more than just work, it reduces the quality of communication. Talking face-to-face is replaced by phone calls. Phone calls replaced by e-mails and instant messaging. E-mails and instant messaging combined with other mediums to create Facebook. The method of communication requiring less and less energy. Communication time increases at the cost of quality.
 
 Quality time. The time you help your mother cool a meal. The time you play games with your kids. The time you ask your siblings how they are doing.
 
 Many middle and upper class jobs exist in the confines of an office. They spend 30 hours or more on computers at their job. They use their smartphones on the subway to either play no-brainer games, check e-mails thoughtlessly, or check Facebook. At home, they watch TV or use their computer to check Facebook. Sometimes, people post things found on the internet on Facebook!
 
 In this white collar life, I believe intelligent stimulation does occur, or else the job turnover would be higher. It's even possible to live a very stimulating life. One can consume fine arts, create a complex computer application at their job, share narrow interests with a narrow crowd (SF jab?). It's the social stimulation that is sacrificed. Many of the fundamental human needs are related to communication. Quality time is sacrificed.
 
 Along with quality communication with people, quality time spent alone is sacrificed. Sunlight, nature, space, allowing one to think freely. This is also reduced in the white collar life.
 
 The allocation of time in one's life, the constant valuation, the balancing of life is my greatest problem.
 
 I haven't written a blog for quite some time because I've been living in South Asian countries, communicating to the people around me, without technology. On my first day in Seoul, a highly developed country, I already feel lonely enough to write this blog post (Seoul deserves a post of it's own).
 
 Of course, there are pros in communication. People share specific interests: online communities. People around the world share knowledge: Wikipedia. Friends and family can see your recent photos and major events on Facebook. It requires attention to to solely use technology for functional purposes, but it's possible. One can solve nearly every problem leveraging the internet, but there are few problems that can only be solved without it.
 
 Note and Disclaimer:
 After middle school, I spent a lot of time on the computer. I took two office jobs as a programmer. After that I began creating physically social games. Then I travelled Asia. There's some personal angst in here, especially related to my current travel move to Seoul. 1096 2013-07-30 14:10:10 2013-07-30 18:10:10 open closed life-and-technology publish 0 0 post 0 Life Personal Philosophy of Technology _edit_last 1 Hong Kong http://rahilpatel.com/blog/hong-kong Wed, 31 Jul 2013 14:41:42 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=1108 <h2>written on 7/2013</h2>
 Chinatown has taken over Manhattan and renamed itself Hong Kong.
 
 Manhattan, and maybe some bland neighborhood in west Brooklyn. A financial district (HK island), a shopping district (Kowloon [Tsim Sha Tsui, Mong Kok]), and some small towns (New Territories). That's it. Well, that's all I was able to see in eleven days.
 
 Even the people seem like New Yorkers; They're gritty, hard-working, uncaring. The people are from the southern region of China, Guangzhou, formerly Canton. They are the businessmen of China. The ones who immigrate directly into the heart of Western cities: New York, San Francisco, Kuala Lumpur.
 
 Most housing and businesses are in giant buildings. From the street one cannot see what's going on inside of them. From the street one cannot see the sky as the floors above the first protrude over the sidewalk, saving people from rain, depriving them of sunshine. It contrasts with India in which you are able to see how people live and work on street level: a mother is washing her clothes, a man is selling wares, a boy is cooking Chinese food from a food stand named Ching Chong Chinese Food. In Hong Kong, there is seemingly nothing going on on the streets. People are either walking to or from work, or shopping at a leisurely pace. Only at rush hour can a majority of the people be found. There's no point of wondering in this city. There's no life in sight.
 
 It seems there is nothing to do here but work. Or at least, that's what's visible. The work seems tough by the general mood of the working people. Likely, 8-10 hour days. Little happiness. Paid a little more than they're expenses for rent and food. If one lives too far from the city, the commute and work can take up an entire day. They live closer to the city to fight for minutes of life. All one can do is work and go home to live.
 
 Despite the numerous people that live there, the city is devoid of life. No one has time to share. I see no reason for people without sufficient income to live here. A better life can be had in a less developed country. One life of a person in India compares to 10 lives in Hong Kong.
 
 The food outside is of low quality, severely lacking vegetables, and often overly salty or sugary. "Fast food". It's cooked quickly and eaten quickly. One has to cook at home to eat healthily and cost-effectively. Food is a part of life, and it's quality can be used as a measurement of quality of life.
 
 Perhaps on their holidays they go to the Kowloon or Hong Kong island to shop, or to an island to get away from it all, but they're not going very far. People often don't go far to consume. A new phone accessory is satisfying enough. Some people take trips to other countries close in proximity for a few days. It gives them a little more life to continue work.
 
 After coming from India, I find it difficult to meet local people, create connections. There are too many people in my building. All I know are the people in my room and the hostel receptionist. The city can be a lonely place. Artists create more in cities because there's less life to live. I have to resort using the computer to find people. It's a shame. I enjoy getting along with anyone around me.
 
 A place like this can transform it's inhabitant. Take the life of that person away, transform them into a working person, a selfish person, a cog. A person who's eyes and mind are focused on few things, ignoring everything around them. This makes it an inhospitable place. I had to spend a lot of time searching for hostels, changing hostels, and only found respite in a Sikh temple, where a more communal life could be found, and the airport. I was able to find more heart in the ugliest of cities: Jaipur, Delhi, Kuala Lumpur, Kathmandu. When I was a cog, I hope I wasn't this inhospitable.
 
 The money pressures people. It controls people. A life can be trapped working their entire life.
 
 Even away from Kowloon, Hong Kong is an expensive place to live. Artists struggle to find cheap rent. Artists aren't well-supported by the government or businesses. Creativity is obviously severely lacking. The business here is completely financial. Startup companies need a two year business plan and are not provided seed money. Great people have to go in debt to do anything valuable here.
 
 I wonder if minorities of China, people who aren't able to make much money, work here. I've only heard of Filipino and Indonesian workers doing domestic work. One of the most interesting parts of Western cities are ethnic enclaves. The lack of diversity creates a conformist society.
 
 To make up for life, people consume media: films, music, television. People on the street and on subways are looking down at their smartphone. Their smartphone provides them with life. This reminds me of myself when I was working. I used socially realistic films to stimulate life in me. Films can display so much life in two hours. Two hours is all people have here. I narrow my goal. I want to make films that remind people of life. To live life. To take time to think, to live, in hopes that they spend more quality time with people.
 
 An aside and opinion:
 I actually had a good time. I met and had great conversations with a few people in my hostel and with people from the School of Create Media in City University of Hong Kong and a few art organizations, but even they want to get out, and without them, I have no reason to be there. The reason I moved out of South Asia is because it lacked like-minded people. If there is neither like-minded people or culture, the place has nothing of interest for me. This is no a place for an artist to thrive. Studios are commercial. There are no artist communities. People work selfishly in commercial studios. It takes effort to get out of the city and enjoy some space. Wandering around this city is depressing. It lacks culture. It lacks areas that have a small town feel. Cantonese and written Chinese is limited and requires a lot of time to learn. There are better choices in East Asia.
 
 
 <h2>written on 3/23</h2>
 The following are passages from my diary, in order, without a timestamp:
 
 day 1:
 The money pressures people to work. One has to be careful to take time and choose their work strategically, whilst doing creative work.
 
 There's nothing to do here but work. Well, maybe not, could be the money pressuring me [to observe quickly].
 
 It's a contrast to India, where people <em>live</em>. Perhaps only the young professional class work. The older people learned how to balance life and work. [*this was empirically disproven].
 
 I need to avoid becoming a directionless wanderer and keep my high standards.
 
 day 2:
 I went around Mong Kok, it's a child's place, like mid-town.
 
 I'm still moving slowly, at a depressing pace. I need to be around excited people. I need Babycastles.
 
 I'd rather contract work from India and small towns around the world than work in this city.
 
 It's only been a day in a touristy part though. Perhaps I will be able to find people, see traditional life, CouchSurf.
 
 Perhaps all cities are the same. I lost my care for them, which was already limited to contemporary art.
 
 I want to live, at home, a place where I cook, then go out to explore, to work in open spaces. I want to work with people. Collaborate. I need to get motivated again. I've lost my self-motivation long ago [sometime in India].
 
 If I do work it has to be meaningful. No compromise. Health, education, technology, humanitarianism. I need to create my own path.
 
 Place yourself in an exciting place. Surround yourself with people. Great people.
 
 day 3:
 Hostel was booked for the weekend. Went to a Sikh temple. Able to stay for two days. Wasted 4 hours packing, transporting, and waiting. Need a solid place to stay to get anything done.
 
 I still don't have the lust to work. I've been merely living for too long. Lazily. To get the lust, I ned to see hardship, dramatic films. I transform into what I consume. I'm unable to be myself. Consume nothing. Live.
 
 I've been avoiding the use of computer, but it is needed to maintain the direction I want: film, game, contemporary art.
 
 Perhaps hardships of cities and dramatic films inspired me in the past.
 
 I need to create direction. I'm juggling too much: exploring the city, meeting people, making games. I'm living a balanced life when that doesn't work in a city if you want to make something great. OR does it?
 
 Although I am not overly excited, I'm quite focused. I just need to continue calmly...This is still much better than doing nothing in India. I'm just doing nothing in another country.
 
 Now that I hear people talk, I care less. I should care, but one must manage time like a business man. I can't satisfy everyone. Need to focus on what's important at this moment in time.
 
 Hong Kong is not interesting at all thus far. I guess it's because I've seen it. It's New York with Chinese people. Just [the ugly parts] mid-town, financial center, and that bland neighborhood in West Brooklyn. Compared to Bhaktapur and Baroda, this place is extremely bland. No wonder people look to media to consume something. It's also no wonder artists create things here. They are limited.
 
 day 4:
 This Sikh temple is a respite from Hong Kong. The people are talkative, helpful. The food is delicious.
 
 In the midst of last night, I decided to be a film-maker:
 Film is a medium that displays life in its rawest form: video and audio. Hopefully more senses in the future.
 
 Yes. Become a filmmaker. The time is now. Join or create a studio. That is your goal. It always was.
 
 Games are cool. They impacted my life by providing great social times. They're fun to think about. Yet, it's nowhere near powerful as film.
 
 Just keep making films. Don't stop. Ones about life.
 
 ...
 
 Day 11:
 Alan is a futurist, whereas I've been living in the past.
 
 I become what I consume.
 
 Lazy day. Overslept. Overtalked. Overcomputered. Lazy Sunday. Maybe I needed the sleep. Or, maybe I was done with Hong Kong, read to plan South Korea. Planning is when I feel I am doing nothing. I'm glad this only occurred on the last day, as opposed to a month [referring to time in India].
 
 I feel out of place. Not wanting to consume. 1108 2013-07-31 10:41:42 2013-07-31 14:41:42 open closed hong-kong publish 0 0 post 0 Hong Kong Life Personal Psychology Schizoid Personality Disorder Travel _edit_last 1 _yoast_wpseo_primary_category medium_post O:11:"Medium_Post":11:{s:16:"author_image_url";s:74:"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/200/200/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png";s:10:"author_url";s:28:"https://medium.com/@rahil627";s:11:"byline_name";N;s:12:"byline_email";N;s:10:"cross_link";s:2:"no";s:2:"id";s:12:"4e1cf2db6ab6";s:21:"follower_notification";s:3:"yes";s:7:"license";s:19:"all-rights-reserved";s:14:"publication_id";s:2:"-1";s:6:"status";s:6:"public";s:3:"url";s:51:"https://medium.com/@rahil627/hong-kong-4e1cf2db6ab6";} Seoul http://rahilpatel.com/blog/seoul Wed, 31 Jul 2013 15:51:26 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=1109 Seoul is the result of conservative middle and upper class Asians living together, isolated from the rest of the world. I grew up with these people. I despised these people. It was the reason I started writing down my thoughts. It was the reason I left my hometown.
 
 There are no distinct areas. It's a city-surburb sprawl. Franchises, shopping malls, restaurants, bars, clubs, and more shopping malls are at the center of each city-suburb. Apartment buildings, offices, and even large houses occupy the surrounding area. The city repeats itself. Six lane streets connect them all, filled with luxury cars alongside a great metro system and bus system. Seoul makes the Asian ethnic enclaves in Western cities seem more traditional. At least Hong Kong is efficient. Seoul is just wasteful.
 
 My hostel feels like an and upper class Asian's house: wooden floors, a random marble staircase, IKEA-like furniture, modern computers, rainfall shower head, air conditioner and lights on all day, a refrigerator full of packaged food and drinks. It's neat, organized, uncreative, unnecessary.
 
 The city is completely indoors. Subways lead to giant shopping malls. Large open spaces, indoors. There's more indoor space than parks. Indoor areas have air conditioner, wifi, tea, and water, everything needed for a person to use a computer. People that live in houses traverse the city in luxury cars as if the city were a suburb. Farmer's markets are indoors. Is this the future?
 
 The influx of recent wealth is immediately apparent. Gungnam Style is real. Everyone has a smartphone, trendy clothes, excess cash for Starbucks coffee, excess time to go drinking and clubbing. They form tight cliques, use technology to communicate with their clique, wear branded clothing to signify status. Conformity is at large.
 
 The city feels like it was built by Disney. People are pampered. Helicopters watch for people swimming at sea. Families and friends travel in large tour-guided groups, afraid of, well, everything. Kids never grow up here. Their parents wouldn't kick them out of their house after high school, or when they're thirty. It's overly comfortable.
 
 Exploration is unwanted. Do artists leave this place?
 
 Consumption is a human need, but the consumption here is heavily affected by media. They love brands. The people here are homebodies, so the power of media is amplified.
 
 Branded companies rule here. Internet companies have wifi spots within retail stores. The metro station card works at retail stores. Companies sponsor popular events. The majority work for companies. Samsung is prevalent. Nearly every electronic appliance, smartphone, and computer in this hostel is made by Samsung.
 
 Many people try to become the people they see in media. They dislike their appearance, wear make-up, high heel shoes, spend more time washing their face, lift weights, possibly use plastic surgery.
 
 I don't belong here. I don't want to be here. I got away from these people long ago. Will I be able to enjoy time spent with them again? Will I be able to value my time with them? Well, I hope this is just the ugly side I am seeing. Every race has its cons.
 
 I've lost the feeling of being on edge, alert. It's making me lazy. I perform better when I am struggling, fighting for something.
 
 All I see is waste. Perhaps it's because I was living in South Asia. I enjoyed the minimalism of living in India and Nepal, spending time and interacting with local people in the same physical location. It's conducive to creativity. It's conducive to living a real life.
 
 Korea brings about the lonely side of me. The use of media and computers resurges. I have to use computers to talk to find and talk to certain people. I have to commute through hordes of coffee shops to reach park, library, or friend. I have to use media to remind myself that there is more to the world than this, to surround myself with things I value. I need to create my own space, distancing myself from the people around me.
 
 All is not negative. It's only my third day. I am living in the party area, so it's admittedly a bad gauge. I met a great person at a restaurant nearby. She works with her mother. It felt like being in my cousin's kitchen. The food is one of the most healthiest and tastiest meals I've had during my entire trip.
 
 Korean people are actually really nice, just shy and not outgoing. I look forward to meeting more people here. It's going to require me to be very outgoing, learn some Korean, and possibly hitchhiking. I need to push myself into these people. Break the safety barrier they created around themselves. Somehow become friends with them, without becoming one of them. 1109 2013-07-31 11:51:26 2013-07-31 15:51:26 open closed seoul publish 0 0 post 0 Personal South Korea Travel _edit_last 1 Lost in Pursuit of the Unknown http://rahilpatel.com/blog/lost-in-pursuit-of-the-unknown Thu, 08 Aug 2013 09:27:37 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=1166 The initial, pleasurable moment fades. One is left to choose direction, again. Continue or try something new? Trying something new means quitting. Continuing in this direction lacks excitement. One begins to question their previous choices. Why did one choose to come here. What was one looking for?
 
 One feels lost. Alone.
 
 This is a universal situation that one reaches at some point in several perspectives. Two of which I've encountered: art and travel.
 
 In art, the design portion is satisfying, with immediate feedback. After working on the design alone for some time, I question my direction, perhaps going off-course a bit. The work becomes drudgery. Social life is greatly hindered as most of the time goes to work.
 
 In travel, exploring a new area is satisfying: meeting people, consuming together, absorbing a new culture, new environments. After taking it all in, the excitement begins to fade.
 
 I look down, away from the world. I close myself off, less likely to have social encounters. I stop meeting people. I stop contacting friends. One feel there is no one to relate.
 
 Continue or try something new?
 
 Trying something new is quitting, usually. To continue one has to fix the problem. The problem is simple; One has an unhealthy social life. To fix it, one has to maintain social connections.
 
 Another person can provide verification that your art is going in the right direction. It's nice to share the pursuit. The chance of a team to finish a project increases with the number of people in it.
 
 To stay in one place, one needs long-term relationships. People to work with, talk to, to consume with.
 
 As a nomad who continually travels, meets people, and takes on then interested jobs, this situation has reoccured several times. I've moved several times, severed several social ties, and worked several jobs.
 
 Then, while pondering what went wrong, I think of this. I consume life: talk with someone, watch a movie, travel. I fill my agenda with social events. I create projects. I meet people. I talk to old friends. I become open. I become excited again.
 
 Both feelings are temporary. 1166 2013-08-08 05:27:37 2013-08-08 09:27:37 open closed lost-in-pursuit-of-the-unknown publish 0 0 post 0 Art Life Travel _edit_last 1 _wp_old_slug lost-in-the-pursuit-of-the-unknown Life and Education http://rahilpatel.com/blog/life-and-education Thu, 08 Aug 2013 11:12:31 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=1174 I met a special person at my hostel in Korea. After having a conversation with him, I was surprised by his intelligence, and then curious of its source.
 
 He's the type who often drinks, watches movies, and is caring to everyone. He told me that he only learns by doing, empiricism. He travels. He'd rather be a laborer than an office worker. He doesn't have specialized skills. He's took farm jobs while using his Austrailian working visa. He enjoys talking to people, learning about culture through conversation. He dislikes clubs, people who don't learn new cultures, conservative people, therefore, many Koreans. He has witty black humor. "I enjoys bars because people I can hear people. In clubs people talk with their dicks." We talked about cultures. How Korea and Japan are similar, in that they are safe, close-minded, not willing to travel [without a tour guide]. We dreamt of owning a hostel.
 
 How can a person who doesn't own a computer be so intelligent? Computers give people the access to infinite information. Isn't the consumption of information how people learn? If schools measure intelligence by memorization, he could be deemed stupid.
 
 I then read a note I underlined from a Fluxus exhibition pamphlet at Nam June Paik Art Center:
 <blockquote>Learning through conversation, inquiries, group play, and games serves as the most effective educational model for the future generations who will live in the knowledge and information society.
 </blockquote>
 
 This person, and most travelers use similar methods for learning. Learning by doing, living, and exploring.
 
 Fluxus <strong>seeks to recreate the experience of learning by mimicking life</strong>. They created an exhibition which required visitors to play using all of their senses, resulting in a social and intelligent experiences.
 
 Jon and Ching, a couple who runs a private school in Taiwan of which I volunteered for, teaches, cooks, feeds, plays with, and cares for students in every aspect of their lives. Classes only make up about 25% of the day. The rest is allocated in reinforcement and normal life activities: group games to aid memorization; artificial conversations to aid English classes; exercise via sports or martial arts; interacting with foreigners for real application; real conversations; cooking, cleaning, and time off. Kids questioned foreigner teachers and explored nearby parks and playground on their own [, under supervision]. Foreign teachers were given freedom to teach anything they wished. They successfully created an amazing educational environment.
 
 Babycastles creates arcades for visitors to play. You enter an arcade. Play a new game with strangers. Enjoy. Explore. Talk about it. The experience is real as required senses. The experience is memorable because it was shared with people. As a result, the experience is fun. Something was really learned, and it will be remembered.
 
 Of course, professors, books, and the internet is not bad, but alone they are not enough. Even reinforcement activities are not enough. It's missing somethings that is often required in order for people to really learn rather than memorize: conversation, inquiries, group play, and games. 1174 2013-08-08 07:12:31 2013-08-08 11:12:31 open closed life-and-education publish 0 0 post 0 Games Life Philosophy of Education _edit_last 1 _yoast_wpseo_primary_category Thoughts on Building a Playground for Adults http://rahilpatel.com/blog/thoughts-on-building-a-playground-for-adults Sun, 11 Aug 2013 12:44:35 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=1198 Disclaimer: Like most of the shit I write, it's written in one sitting, unedited.
 
 As a curious person who's recently consumed more than anyone ever should, I've been thinking about an idyllic place where people learn, share, and play. The ideal playground, but for adults and children alike.
 
 Why create a playground? People know the world is a playground, yet, sometimes it doesn't feel that way so people go to places or do things which help remind them of this. A playground a place where you feel free, where you can do whatever you want, with friends, with strangers, without constraints. The result of play could simply clear one's head of the day's work, or it could lead to valuable conversation, ideas, all of it shared with people.
 
 Taking from the Wikipedia page, I concur that "personal development may be gained through the enhancement of skills, such as playing, communicating and cooperating with other children and adults in the playground."
 
 As a child I explored suburbia, often with friends. We'd explore nearby neighborhoods on our single-gear bikes, play playground games such a tag and variants we'd make up, play sports, catch tadpoles. We'd make bike ramps. We'd take sneak my Dad's BB gun and shoot bottles. We were all quite competitive too. We'd see who can reach the furthest distance jumping off a swing without breaking a leg. We'd wrestle. We'd race everywhere. We'd talk. We'd fight. We'd finish homework early to maximize play time. We'd ace tests. The world was ours.
 
 As people get old, take a job, have a family, the feeling gets lost somewhere. The world isn't so playful anywhere. The child becomes an inner child. The inner child goes deep.
 
 I want to help elder people find their inner child, so that they enjoy exploring and creating again in hope that they regain the energy and confidence to do bolder things in life.
 
 There are certain places that feel more playful than others though. Natural places and more playful than cities. People in small towns are more playful than city people. People in hostels, cafes, and bars are more likely to engage in conversation with people that they haven't met.. These are spaces where people spend their free time and are more likely to socialize, and play.
 
 Play isn't always valuable though. It's possible nothing is gained from play. Playing flip cup or a video game repetitively without intelligent conversation or sufficient competition is probably not a good use of time. In addition, excessive play is valueless too. Play has to be limited by time: play time. The space has to contain things that are conducive to creativity and learning.
 
 The ideal playground should attract all kinds of people. People in cities use meetup.com and local events of particular interest, but it narrows the audience, which is kind of the point of it. People in small towns simply go to a local public place: a bar, a plaza, a cafe. There's value in both places. One can meet a like-minded individual at the meetup, but meeting these people too often may lose value. Given that one is quite optimistic, one can extract a lot of value from people in a public place as it's more diverse, and the customers rotate.
 
 One of my favorite forms of current adults playgrounds are science museums. Allow adults to drink and sit at a science museum, change up the exhibited objects during intervals, and bam! A pretty good adult playground. Well, that's a good start at least.
 
 Science may not be interesting to everyone. It should be renamed to something less sciency and more playful, neither targeted toward adults or children, and not limited to edutainment.
 
 It should be free, available to the public, open most of the day and night.
 
 It should be a mix of educational entertainment and non-educational entertainment (competitive?), a bar and cafe, an outdoors area. Hmm, maybe that's too large.
 
 Meh, that's enough for now. Maybe I'm over-evaluating life, again. 1198 2013-08-11 08:44:35 2013-08-11 12:44:35 open closed thoughts-on-building-a-playground-for-adults publish 0 0 post 0 Art Life Philosophy of Education _edit_last 1 Conscription Woes at a Jjimjibang http://rahilpatel.com/blog/conscription-woes-at-a-jjimjibang Tue, 13 Aug 2013 05:49:42 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=1225 I was observing the sloth-like inhabitants of a 찜질방 [jjimjibang] in 춘천 [Chuncheon], 대한민국 [Daehan Minguk/South Korea]. I thought these people only existed in bathhouses in films set in feudal times, yet, here they were. The generation gap between these people and the people at the hostel I stayed at in 서울 [Seoul] was akin to the one in Tokyo Story. I wondered how people could conspicuously consume media to such a degree, how people could conform so much. Just being there, it became clear that Korean and Japanese people are insular, prey to popular media (MMORPGS, television, and manga), unsocial, timely like machines. I wondered if they contained any direction, ambition, or excitement.
 
 There was only one guy who stood out from the crowd: a university aged kid with scruffy shoulder-length hair and hipster glasses. He was reading and writing with vigor and good posture. We were the only two people that didn't have the posture of a snorlax. We made eye contact, but I decided not to approach him as he was with his family.
 
 At a later point, when he moved to a seat away from his family, I approached him. I asked 실러합니다, 연어 헐 수 이ㅆ어요 [excuse me, do you speak English]? He energetically mentioned something about his Android phone charging, thinking that I wanted to charge my iPhone and gestured that I couldn't because the second socket was taped up. I concluded that my Korean pronunciation was terrible.
 
 We then spoke in English. I asked if he was from here [춘천/Chuncheon]. He blurted out that he is going to the army at 2PM tomorrow. Then I noticed he wasn't excited, he was frightened. He then spilled out all of his emotions, or at least as much as he could express at his English level. He told me that when he told his girlfriend that he was going to the army, she broke up. He said he finished his freshman year in college. He's 23. He told me couldn't afford to go to graduate school [to avoid conscription]. He said they're going to shave his head tomorrow. He blurted he plays the guitar.
 
 It was 1AM and the people around us were sleeping so I directed to move the conversation to the locker room. It provided a much needed small penis humor.
 
 We continued to talk. He said he loves to play games -- League of Legends, Minecraft, and Starcraft. "The good old days". He continually pulls his hair up in stress, takes off his glasses, washes his face of the occasional tears. He said he wants to cry, but can't. I asked what he's afraid of. He said will be unable to contact anyone, perhaps one or two days per month, if he's lucky. He's said going to miss his family, girlfriend, and that he just wants to play the guitar and games with his friends. He said that the time [two years] is going to waste [he gestures toward the trash can]. He just wants to live.
 
 He asked about me. I answered. When I mentioned that I'm going to Japan next, he said it's dangerous. He felt that the nuclear radiation form the meltdown at Fukushima affects all of Japan. He later mentioned an island that is disputed between Korea and Japan [독도/獨島/Dokdo], saying that he does not like Japan because of the situation.
 
 He thought I was brave to travel alone, to move and work in different cities. He said he is a coward. When people fight, he becomes frightened.
 
 He asked what I thought about South Korea. I said it's nice, but it has its cons due to the lack of diversity, and especially after hearing his situation, I appreciate America more. He said he wants to go to America.
 
 He mentions that there is going to be a star fall at 3AM. He and his sister are going to try to see it. I decide not to interrupt and let them go.
 
 He said we'll meet again the next morning at 10AM. We exchange contact info [Facebook and e-mail addresses]. He said he will contact me again on his first holiday, which is in 100 days.
 
 I go to sleep. I wake up at night often as 찜질방 [jjimjibangs] are quite uncomfortable due to the white fluorescent lights that are on all night and the high room temperature [or higher than my perception of room temperature]. I saw him sleeping at around 6 and 7 AM. I saw him awake at around 8 or 9 AM. A janitor wakes me up at 9:30AM. He was gone.
 
 The next day I enter a cafe to use wifi. I accept his Facebook friend request. Now I must wait 100 days, as with everyone else he knows.

We debated the differences of people in cities and suburbs.
 
 I said people in the city are more likely to care for everybody, not just their family.
 
 He responded with a story about a time his brother's father-in-law was sick: The father-in-law needed a large amount of blood per day for seven days. A new person for each day was required to give a large amount of blood. The needle they use is large and the machines scared most public volunteers. No one from his family volunteered. My uncle asked some of his friends from the city, and they agreed to help, without knowing his father-in-law.
 
 I pondered if a similar middle to upper class suburbanite suffered a large change in life resulting in her to have little money, would he change? My uncle responded no. The event would be traumatic. A person who went from poor to rich is unable to go backwards, however, if the person was never poor, the person may change.
 
 These people become comfortable, forgetting about other people, become insular, and instead drone on meaningless things. City folk fight for time; Surburbanites find ways to pass it. Values are lost. Their lives are the center. When they are reminded of less fortunate people, do they not spend time thinking about it, responding to it?
 
 They cling to their own kin, unable to melt.
 
 The pro is that they retain culture. Ethnic enclaves in western cities do just that. In New York, Chinatowns, an East Asian area (Flushing), A South Asian area (Jackson Heights), a European area (Greenpoint), a Hassidic Jew (between Williamsburg and Clinton Hill) area all exist in the surburbs. It works out really well. Their kids can choose to melt into the city or stay with their kin.
 
 The con is that they are insular, which becomes clearly apparent when one goes to their origin country in which 99% of all people are of their kind. Common cultural behaviors dominate society affecting daily life. <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/seoul">Seoul is a weird DisneyLand</a>. India is a mess. Conformism becomes stronger. Divergence becomes harder. Creative people desire some place better.
 
 Some people are flexible, some aren't.
 
 <blockquote>
 Flexibility
 
 Populations differ in their phenotypic plasticity, which is the ability of an organism with a given genotype to change its phenotype in response to changes in its habitat, or to move to a different habitat.
 
 To a greater or lesser extent, all living things can adjust to circumstances. The degree of flexibility is inherited, and varies to some extent between individuals. A highly specialized animal or plant lives only in a well-defined habitat, eats a specific type of food, and cannot survive if its needs are not met. Many herbivores are like this; extreme examples are koalas which depend on eucalyptus, and pandas which require bamboo. A generalist, on the other hand, eats a range of food, and can survive in many different conditions. Examples are humans, rats, crabs and many carnivores. The tendency to behave in a specialized or exploratory manner is inherited – it is an adaptation.

 I normally constantly evaluate time, but I wonder, how does one justify it?
 
 Time.
 
 One could spend a lifetime in a single place, thinking about doing something and never doing it. One could spend a lifetime with family. One could spend a lifetime with strangers. One could spend a lifetime learning and never doing. One could spend a lifetime doing and never learning.
 
 One has to balance time. Some time with family, some with friends, some with others, some on work, some on the needy, some thinking, some exploring.
 
 My greatest struggle is balancing time. [blog link to another post]
 
 How does one justify time?
 
 Braid took three and a half years to make. Babycastles can throw an event together in a few days. Which has a larger impact? The impact is the same. Braid effects more people because it is instilled on a distributable medium. Performances only effect the people nearby. If I weren't in New York, I wouldn't know about Babycastles. That would have been a shame.
 
 Values change over time.
 
 When I was in the U.S. I justified time for fine art. When I was traveling, I justified time for travel and meeting people. When I was India, I valued my time with family and neighbors. When I was in Hong Kong and Seoul, I justified time with like-minded people.
 
 How can one evaluate time in their life? What's the most efficient method. What is most balanced?
 
 Life has to be balanced to output great work efficiently. One needs to be social to measure time, yet working to complete a project, and taking care of their family and friends.
 
 While traveling Hong Kong and Seoul, I didn't feel like working on a an old game which requires hours of programming on of several hours from several people. It didn't make sense. I could directly effect someone with a public performance that takes less time to create and has the same impact, or even more simply, by talking to them. Why go through the mess of making a game for a medium when one can use new media and public art to effect people directly. I feel that I made some effect to the people I talked to. No work necessary. Just conversation.
 
 When I think about the less fortunate, I think about what I can do. NGO effect people directly, but again, it's a small audience. Protests and other small statements have little to no effect. Large moves are necessary. What difference can an individual make? Most diplomats enter a system. How did Ghandi and MLK do it? It was just talking. Through letters to powerful individuals or speech. It's always conversation.
 
 Talking to people is valuable.

 Confidence swings from a Ai Wei Wei to a suburbanite in the same day. Lack of personal image in the perspectives of others blocks the gauging of relationships. If I have work, I don't care. It's only when I stop working, when I start to think of it. Then, I pick my shit up and continue.
 
 <blockquote>The theory of mind (ToM) impairment describes a difficulty someone would have with perspective taking. This is also sometimes referred to as mind-blindness. This means that individuals with a ToM impairment would have a hard time seeing things from any other perspective than their own. Individuals who experience a theory of mind deficit have difficulty determining the intentions of others, lack understanding of how their behavior affects others, and have a difficult time with social reciprocity. ToM deficits have been observed in people with autism spectrum disorders, people with schizophrenia, people with attention deficit disorder, persons under the influence of alcohol and narcotics, sleep-deprived persons, and persons who are experiencing severe emotional or physical pain.

It begins with excitement. There are areas to explore, people to meet, things to do. I wake up spontaneously. I think about what to do that day, and I do it. I'm consuming, exploring, constantly creating new direction, thinking every moment. Along with consumption comes creativity. I create new work, new projects, and inspire others to do the same. Time goes slow. I think by the minute. I'm extroverted. Life is balanced -- time with friends, strangers, and very little personal work. I value social time.
 
 At some point, the direction is lost. I lingered for too long. The motivation disappears. I fail to maintain the consumption and creation. Depression replaces the void. Introversion and indifference take over. The world becomes uninteresting. I want to recover as fast as possible, but it's difficult to pinpoint what went wrong and how to fix it. Time flies because I have no social life to gauge it, or, I have a social life, but am conforming to others, and am unable to maintain my own direction with it.
 
 What happened? Why did I stop?
 
 My value in social time with others dissipates. I push people away because I need to go in my own direction, but doing so, I lose the social excitement. I still haven't learned how to maintain the excitement. I haven't learned how to maintain a relationship.
 
 After cutting off my social connections, the rest of the world keeps me alive. Human struggle. The lives of those less fortunate: the bums on the streets, the families in the slums of Kathmandu, and the uneducated kids in India. Struggle depicted in films. Films are more powerful to introverts and especially schizoids because they depict a life without interacting with it. It's enough to keep me working, but creativity is gone.
 
 What's the solution?
 
 I thought a more social job, especially one that interacts with kids and family would cure it. Something meaningful to me. I volunteered at a school, but it was too much. I couldn't think correctly. Although I loved it, I ended up pushing away from it to make time for myself.
 
 Perhaps I just need to take on as many projects as possible. Work is a schizoid's best friend. Learn to manage time and squeeze in personal time between the projects. Perhaps I need a family force myself to care. Perhaps I simply need to reach out.
 
 For now, I just keep moving on. The cycle repeats.
 
 'Tis the life of a nomadic schizoid.
 
 --
 I <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Schizoid/comments/1ru414/travel/">posted on reddit</a> about this.
 
 The post:
 I want to know some schizoid travel experiences.
 
 I have extremely intense feelings, observing everything, loving life, being social, exploring with others, meeting new people, slowing consuming it all, until I inevitably become bored again.
 In the beginning I'm extremely observant. I spend nearly all of my time in the public. My mind is exploding. I want to explore everything around me - culture, people, and nature. Empiricism. I wonder why anyone would spend any time on the computer, or work, or spend time inside of a house. I have fine art ideas on the level of Banksy, but wouldn't want to execute the ideas alone, and there's probably no one that thinks similarly. I don't care for media (film, music, non-social games), only the interaction of people. I'm also extremely social. I don't do anything without people. There are other travelers to meet and explore with. I love the public, as I'm deeply curious about people, in a Humans of New York sort of way. Programming with my headphones at night feels like a chore and waste of life. I make decisions quick.
 
 After some time, the intense feelings of novelty fade, the external stimuli is lowered, the initial motivation that woke me up early morning is gone, and I rely on the social connections I created, tending those relationships, attending social events. Still, I fight to be social.
 After some more time, my narrow interests change from travel to more specific things and I begin to flake out on social events as I value them less. I run into the indecision problem. I'm doomed until I create a new direction, after which the cycle restarts.
 
 It seems it would be more fun to travel to a new place, find another job, work for a few months, then to live in one place. At least, for the moment. Life becomes an adventure.
 
 How about you?
 
 Are there any other nomads? Programming and backpacking? Lived in several cities? 1302 2013-09-06 03:34:31 2013-09-06 07:34:31 open closed the-life-of-a-nomadic-schizoid publish 0 0 post 0 Life Personal Schizoid Personality Disorder Travel _edit_last 1 Social Norms and Asia http://rahilpatel.com/blog/social-norms-and-asia Tue, 10 Sep 2013 18:13:37 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=1330 While travelling in hostels in Asia, a popular topic among travelers are social norms.
 
 How Asians care for the safety, education, and future of their children. How Korean and Japanese people work long hours, feel that they worked hard, and deserve drinking the weeknight away. How Koreans spend time over meals, eating and talking. How it's illegal to talk on a cell phone in a subway in Japan. How Taiwanese people care for everything -- their country's image, friends, family, foreigners -- or, how they take a single incident and use it to create a macro image of something.
 
 Well, maybe that's more stereotyping.
 
 Anyway, in homogeneous countries, social norms are more powerful than in diverse ones. A largeer percent of people hold the same beliefs and conform to existing norms. To be different one has to ignore more of their surroundings and maintain a deviant group.
 
 I've talked to some smart people. Perhaps not the smartest or most confident, but smart enough to deviate from the norms they were raised in and to choose their own path. All of them want to do the same thing: immigrate to a more diverse country, any westernized country -- Australia, New Zealand, Scandinavia, USA. They feel that they are unable to develop in their own country and feel it may be easier in a westernized country.
 
 I've always questioned this. Is it easier to grow up and develop in the US than in Japan? Both are developed countries. Do social norms play such a great role? If one can't be different in their own country, what makes them feel they can do better in another? Is it easier to be different in a westernized country? Is this the con of culture?
 
 I understand there are several reasons for people to immigrate from less developed countries, but is solely the influence of social norms of homogeneous developed countries enough of a reason? My personal view of the nature versus nurture debate, in general, is so: there is a bottom line in which environment matters, the lack of access to money, education, free time, etc., but once an individual has that, especially at an early age, their potential is based on genetics. Japan and Korea have these necessary things. Are the social norms so strong as to stop people from developing further? Why aren't Japanese and Korean people pushing out Nobel Prizes? Well, maybe Korea and Taiwan are still young in terms of development, and even the Meiji restoration was only a hundred years ago.
 
 The said smart people felt so. So much as to say that they don't want their own kids to grow up in their country, which is one of the greatest reasons people immigrate.
 
 I don't know because I haven't grown up in one, unless the suburbs count. Actually, my transition from a suburb to city has similar reasons!
 
 Anyway, it's just a thought revived while talking to a French guy about social norms we observed in Asian countries, which then sparked my recent experiences with Koreans I befriended and whom I had emotional conversations with. 1330 2013-09-10 14:13:37 2013-09-10 18:13:37 open closed social-norms-and-asia publish 0 0 post 0 Life Philosophy of Education Travel _edit_last 1 Creative Programming http://rahilpatel.com/blog/creative-programming Sat, 29 Jun 2013 00:41:54 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=3544 <blockquote>

 <blockquote>
 Populations differ in their phenotypic plasticity, which is the ability of an organism with a given genotype to change its phenotype in response to changes in its habitat, or to move to a different habitat.
 
 To a greater or lesser extent, all living things can adjust to circumstances. The degree of flexibility is inherited, and varies to some extent between individuals. A highly specialized animal or plant lives only in a well-defined habitat, eats a specific type of food, and cannot survive if its needs are not met. Many herbivores are like this; extreme examples are koalas which depend on eucalyptus, and pandas which require bamboo. A generalist, on the other hand, eats a range of food, and can survive in many different conditions. Examples are humans, rats, crabs and many carnivores. The tendency to behave in a specialized or exploratory manner is inherited – it is an adaptation.
 
 Rather different is developmental flexibility: "An animal or plant is developmentally flexible if when it is raised or transferred to new conditions it develops so that it is better fitted to survive in the new circumstances". Once again, there are huge differences between species, and the capacities to be flexible are inherited.

Personal history and social determinism.]
 
 I'm a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation#Flexibility.2C_acclimatization.2C_learning">flexible</a> person. I adapt to the place I live. Recently, I've stayed in several countries and unconsciously adapted to each one, resulting in extreme observation of a different kind.
 
 In the suburbs I was prone to several faults, wasting a lot of time, letting time pass without thought.
 
 In San Francisco, I was amazed by the amount new things going on compared to the suburbs, especially related to diversity in income and race. I worked hard played hard.
 
 In New York, I allocated every hour into work, leaving social time only for people related to my narrow interests or work. There was no place to relax.
 
 In Taiwan, I became more outgoing and familial. I talked to people in the public, spent time with people I previously wouldn't have, and I valued conversations with individuals.
 
 In Thailand, I was alone, thinking like an introvert, only able to consume because of the language barrier.
 
 In Penang, I was quite social, but fought time to focus on work.
 
 In India, I became extremely social. I valued social time more than anything. I'd spend the entire day with people, unable to do any computer work alone. I sat outside everyday, went out with my uncle often, played games with friends, taking every social opportunity. I also became more minimalist, not buying anything, save food. I also didn't have to go far to be social, so there was no commute times.
 
 In Nepal, I maintained my social outgoing self, consumed the culture around me, but was able to do a little more computer work as I was away from deep social connections.
 
 In Seoul, I became more introvert, mostly because I was unable to find like-minded people to work or go out with, but also because of the language barrier, and living near the bourgeoisie.
 
 I try hard to be myself in every place, but I always adapt to some degree. I keep my space. I have to fight to balance life despite having terrible time management skills.
 
 Knowing that I adapt to my surroundings to some extent, it's important to choose the right place. 
 
 Where's the most optimal place to learn, taking the environment into consideration?
 
 A place with smart peers. That's all that matters. Really.
 
 A smart person in a suburb could be wasting potential. Conversely, smart people should return to their homes to invest in their home country.
 
 
 
 This thought occurred when a group of Parisians entered my hostel. About to begin their Master's degree, they know at least four languages -- French, English, some Spanish, and some Korean. They socialize quickly, smoke, and drink as much as Koreans do. They're quick, smart, and get shit done. They remind me of the people from New York, specifically Brooklyn.
 
 Are the top global cities -- New York, London, Paris -- the best place to grow up? I think so.
 
 First, just live. Don't get stuck in indecision.
 
 A smart person learns from any given situation: a two-year conscription in South Korea, laborious rural jobs, whatever. There's something to learn.
 
 Still
 
 The place should be diverse in income, race, and intelligence.
 
 
 also write about how I adapt to all environments: more social in India, more introvert in Seoul, more hard-working in New York, prone to laziness in suburbs.
 
 also write about how some people value people so much so that they stay at home, become and inspiration to the people around them
 
 also write about maintaining social and environmental values, socializing with all classes of people, all ages, all countries, not wasting money, cooking instead of eating out, working in parks and hostels instead of cafes 1265 2013-11-26 05:45:03 2013-11-26 10:45:03 open closed flexibility-and-learning publish 0 0 post 0 Personal Travel _edit_last 1 Learning Languages is Difficult for Narrow-minded People http://rahilpatel.com/blog/learning-languages-is-difficult-for-narrow-minded-people Tue, 10 Sep 2013 18:47:02 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=1324 I'm narrow-minded. I often go in a single direction, ignoring everything else, or anything I don't value. It's terrible. It's probably why I stopped being so narrow and started traveling.
 
 People who conspicuously consume have an advantage over me. They soak in language.
 
 I've met a lot of travelers who can speak several languages. Most of them learned a significant amount by watching TV shows.
 
 I don't watch TV shows because I don't value my time watching them. Of course, now that I want to learn a specific language I'll do it. Still, it sucks.
 
 TV teaches everything one needs about language except physical practice, the act of responding. Asian people take English class for several years, memorize a lot of vocabulary and grammar, but are still unable to hold a conversation in English.
 
 The best way to learn a language is to live in a country where they speak and place yourself in a social place everyday -- a job that forces you to talk. Or, just regularly use a language exchange service to find someone to Skype with over the internet.
 
 Another problem is that I'm indifferent to social norms and conventions, including idle conversation. I don't say "Hello, how are you doing" to everyone. I'm concise, down to business. So even when I am in a new country, unless I'm traveling and being my extroverted happy self, I don't really care to talk so much.
 
 For these reasons, language is not naturally learned for me. I have to artificially learn by forcing myself to watch terrible TV shows and have valueless conversations with people, or, somehow create a meaningful experience that involves me talking to people.
 
 Poopie.

 Life and work. Living and working. It's something I feel I've been striving for my entire life.
 
 I feel that the related term, work-life balance, suggests that they are separate entities.
 
 <blockquote>Work–life balance is a concept including proper prioritizing between "work" (career and ambition) and "lifestyle" (health, pleasure, leisure, family and spiritual development/meditation).
 <cite><em>Wikipedia</em>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work%E2%80%93life_balance">Work-Life Balance</a></cite>
 </blockquote>
 
 But I disagree. They shouldn't be treated as so.
 
 <blockquote>Paul Krassner remarked that anthropologists, use a definition of happiness that is to have as little separation as possible "between your work and your play.</blockquote>
 
 Some people can go to an office, work, then enjoy life after work, never thinking about work. The times are separated in their schedules. This leads to a work hard play hard lifestyle. I never fit it. I'm constantly trying to fit work in life. I have no set hours or routine. I just live. Maybe I work 12 hours a day working a game I'm motivated to create or 10 hours volunteering at a school, or maybe I work 3 hours a day, spending most of the time on, well, life. Life doesn't have a schedule.
 
 After telling a friend that I felt that I've lived for several years while travelling, she responded, "You feel it was long because you experienced so much." It's true. You have to constantly experience new things. You have to keep living, even while working.
 
 If the work doesn't provide enough new experiences, then you're likely going to quit. You have to create new experiences at the workplace. Be social and creative, yet work hard, simultaneously.
 
 I found it quite difficult to have new social experiences in a specific type of work: developing software on a computer. In computer programming, you are facing a computer. You're sight is focused on an operating system. You rely on audio for new experience, especially when inside a building. When I was programming, I spent most of the time in public places: in libraries, outside, in a cafe, on a train, in a hostel, places after meeting someone or attending an event. These tend to be the best workplaces because they have the most amount of life. Still, it wasn't enough. I wasn't experiencing enough life. I filled the void with films, consuming as fast as possible between work. It was much better than an office, but still not enough. There wasn't enough face-to-face social time. I failed to balance work-life.
 
 I imagine it's best to have a backup workplace where there will always be friends or family there. Home with the kids, a co-working studio. Then one can work from anywhere, mixing life and work freely, but having a guaranteed place to come back to, so one doesn't have to hunt for cafes at night or on rainy days, and one doesn't have to be alone.
 
 It's ironic that computers, technology, a thing that made communication easy, lead to a poor social life.
 
 I always juggle my two ambitions: game and film. I like games as an emerging art medium, but I feel the process of making games, programming, makes maintaining a good social life difficult, especially compared to the process of making films.
 
 Or, more likely the case, I suck at balancing life and work. 1341 2013-09-11 12:47:19 2013-09-11 16:47:19 open closed life-and-work publish 0 0 post 0 Life Personal Philosophy of Technology _edit_last 1 _wp_old_slug life-and-work-2 _yoast_wpseo_primary_category Travels End: The Return of Unsocial Life http://rahilpatel.com/blog/travels-end-the-return-of-unsocial-life Mon, 25 Nov 2013 11:54:06 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=1373 [Old draft.

 When I arrived in Taipei I was excited, to travel, to create, to learn Chinese, to socialize. It started with the normal intense feelings of travel where I'd consume everything and think at incredible speeds to continually have new experiences; Life is an adventure. I especially consumed Chinese as it was one of my goals, furthering my social life. I was extremely happy and extremely social. I'd go out with hostelmates, schoolmates, meet artists, and even talk to people on the street (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/TaiwanesePeople">Humans of Taiwan)</a>. I had several ideas I was excited to share and begin.
 
 It worked well, for about two weeks. I felt a slow decline. I forced myself to continue. First, Humans of New York stopped, I was unable to talk to strangers again. Many weeks later, I don't care to talk to strangers. I don't care to talk to anyone really, anymore.
 
 "Do I want to be a normal member of society, or should I be my hermit self, ignoring the world?"
 
 "I ignored everyone in Hampton Roads, why should I spend time with people in Taipei? Unless it's a small town feel."
 
 "Focus on art: film studio, humans, Vincent moon, etc. Stop going out for social situations. Explore instead."
 
 "Be social to keep speed to life."

 Transforming into my former hard-working self. Need to relax, stay outside, be social, work at a cafe or school, freelance art and programming.
 
 No! Don't be so anti-social. Talk to people on a daily basis. It's how you keep track of time.
 
 Get a scooter. Buses are a waste of time.
 
 Teach at a nearby school, work at a nearby cafe, be social, stay outside, be creative as you were while traveling.
 
 Be quick like the guy from Toronto.

 Yesterday and Today, I feel great, relaxed. A direction was chosen. The problem of last week was indecision.
 
 I still feel extremely restless every morning, but learning languages, talking to people, walking outside, eases it.
 
 I can't wait to find an apartment, get a scooter, make things. Still, I have to be careful of time. The other classmates have already found an apartment!
 
 Today I felt on top of the world. No deadline. Nothing needed to be done. No stress. Worry free life. Is that what I need for art? Is that why India did not work? Was it too emotional for me? Consuming without creating?
 
 Fuck. Wasted more time. Need to control myself. 8 hour workdays, including cafe and tutor
 
 I need to control my time. That's my greatest problem. Follow the plan.bless wanderlust.
 
 10/7
 Take time to sleep, think creatively, then make a move. But make decisions quick! Keep living.
 
 Learning a language requires routine. There's no way around it.
 
 I have no idea of what life is. Should I care for the less fortunate? Innovate? Live happily in a third world country? It seems all I can do is live. Spend less time in indecision and do as much as I can, while still taking the time to design and plan.
 
 Nap anywhere anytime. But try to stay up during the day, to do work with people.
 
 Schedule yourself
 
 Don't worry about money. Freelance programming! Focus time on learning, work, and travel.
 
 Plan less, do more? Need more projects! Need more life!
 
 我不喜歡commuting in Taipei, or, I'm being indecisive again, as usual. I need to calm down, stay in my neighborhood, make stuff. Work more, walk less.
 
 I'm missing out on so much life.
 
 Create stickies of humans, Vincent moon, edward yang, babycastles, languages, and calavino at home and at my workplace.
 
 Power generator, food cart, projector.
 
 Keep exploring, keep taking on new projects, keep talking to people, keep enjoying life.

 Consuming the things around me as opposed to something specific. Have to learn when to consume around and specific. Time self.
 
 10/9
 I didn't do much today. My brain was slow. Social life stopped after 6pm. I slept in an air conditioned library and computered a little. I accomplished nothing. Caffeine withdrawal? At least when I have caffiene, I'm fighting for life, doing something. Without it, I have no social energy or interest.
 
 I need to maintain one of he following to stay active: social life and excitement, caffiene, or exercise.
 
 There was so much time in a day. What the fuck happened to it today? I need to consume more of the world around me. I was ignoring too much. If I ignore the world, I can always watch a film, but I failed to do that. I just went through the day, meaningless.
 
 After taking a nap, one should do something social.
 
 Difficult to live and create simultaneously. Study hard at night. All phrases, vocab, writing, listening.
 
 I'm waking up without reason, creativity. I really miss that. I'm unable to balance life and work. It distracts me from my personal direction. My motivation.
 
 Learning a language without a motivation is really difficult. I need reason to talk to people, not just for the sake of practicing.
 
 Dont let anyone take you in the wrong direction. You don't have to spend time learning chinese with classmates if it doesn't motivate you. Learn it in your own way. It's more fun, more serious, much more interesting, in my view. See the beauty in the world.
 
 Being with people, I lose interest in people, and I lose creativity.
 
 Remember, you don't have to do anything. It's up to you. It's okay to sleep, explore, in fact, it's necessary.
 
 I should be social about things I love. That's why babycastles worked. They were people with similar interests. I need to hang with people with similar interests, or, completely foreign people that no one knows.
 
 Use 30 minutes of memrise in the morning and evening for each language. Watch some TV. No, that's unsocial. Spend time with people. Get a professional or social job. Fuck the library.
 
 Never overwork yourself.
 
 ...
 
 school, very social
 
 Half way through the class I made the decision that, although I failed to do what I set out to do -- join or create a new media company -- I would finish the Chinese class. Feeling that my classmates would do better by going to class and studying after school, I started to go back to class, and hang out with my classmates. Besides, they were my closest friends. My Taiwanese friends all have jobs.
 
 I was social. I'd go to class. Hang out with the classmates after school, and often at night. Sometimes after class I'd go to the Language Corner, which is something a few people at school started to help people learn Chinese. I started going there because I realized I didn't feel like talking to strangers, so I started talking to them.
 
 With the class, after-class activity, and hanging out with the people at my hostel, my day was booked. I'd be social until I needed to sleep. I'd drink with hostel mates at the hostel, or a nearby bar. I didn't mind spending time with people. In fact, I want to.
 
 I made sure whatever I did was interactive. I doing things with people. That's all that mattered. I felt that if I weren't doing something with someone, then it was meaningless, as if the moment in time wouldn't exist.
 
 ...
 
 I moved to an apartment. This made me quite lonely.
 
 Near the end of class I basically gave up on Chinese. I started using English, thinking in English, not caring for the class. The intrinsic motivation was completely gone. I wasn't traveling, I didn't want to talk, so why learn Chinese? It didn't make sense. I need the urge to talk to Chinese-only speaking people to learn Chinese. This is why I don't like school. But this is also my failure, as I was unable to retain motivation for three months, barely one.
 
 I wasn't fighting for time. I wasn't maximizing my time in a country that I would never be in again. I didn't have a project I was striving for. I wasn't fighting to make every hour of my life count. I started to become lazy. Forgetting that I am in debt. I needed some kind of reality check, but it never came. I just decided to give up until class ended. After that, I'd have to do something. I'd have to get a job.
 
 ...
 
 after school, alone
 
 Was I social for the sake of learning a language? For the sake of traveling? So I don't forget about other people? The Humans project? A normal social life?
 
 Half way through class I felt I consumed all I could from Taipei. I've seen everything. Nothing excited me. So, I stuck to my classmates. I followed them. Zero creativity. I just followed. It was fun, socially normal. The problem was whenever I was alone, I had trouble be social with other people. I just wasn't interested in the rest of the world anymore. I tried movies, but movies were still too far from life. It was a tough time. I didn't feel like doing anything at times. I'd just "study" Chinese. I didn't care for the Humans project. I didn't care for making games. I didn't care for art. A depression, for sure.
 
 After the class ended, I stopped waking up on time. I lost circadian rhythm immediately. I lost social life. I didn't contact anyone. I failed to use technology to maintain a social life. I failed to be creative. I failed to be social enough to new people.
 
 A few depressing days followed in which I'd wake up late, not be social, not want to create my own direction, overeat, oversleep, plan a lot, but do nothing in reality. Everything is in my head. No actions are taken. Just thoughts. Over-thinking, over-planning, over-researching, indecision. Failing to "just do it". Social interaction is how I track time. Without people's feedback, I'm unable to see progress. I need people. I did absolutely nothing, or, I was radically changing, again.
 
 I started to create my own path. More things to do. More in my own direction. I was okay with being alone. I could think quite clearly. I exercised. I still slept whenever I wanted, but I felt good. My former self. On top of the world in a different way. My own way. I didn't consume anything. I did what I wanted.
 
 Which life is better? A social conformist one or a loner creative? Why am I unable to balance the two? All I need to do is spend a few hours being social, and a few hours being myself, yet I fail and fall into extremes. As always. I'm too obsessive.
 
 The solution? Have someone to schedule my life everyday. Or, create a timer and follow it. Somehow.
 
 Or continue to be social during the day and do my personal work at night, when everyone is asleep. 1373 2013-11-25 06:54:06 2013-11-25 11:54:06 open closed travels-end-the-return-of-unsocial-life publish 0 0 post 0 Experience Personal Schizoid Personality Disorder Self-assessment Taiwan Travel _edit_last 1 Journey to Yarsa http://rahilpatel.com/blog/journey-to-yarsa Mon, 30 Dec 2013 16:43:41 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=1399 Journey to Yarsa is a simple documentary that bares little difference from a traveller's video. It follows a family in Nepal to pick Yarsagumba, a prized fungus.
 
 Perhaps the viewing experience was affected by my current meh mood, but I felt no emotions toward the film. It was a weird experience. Clearly there was some struggle going on. Maybe it was the happiness of Nepalese people, and my real experience with them that voided the film of any feeling of struggle.
 
 Or, more likely the case, it was the constant voice over dialogue that took my attention away from the video, not allowing me to think, to observe, to create thoughts myself. I always lose attention whenever a documentary because it doesn't ask the audience to think. I don't need people talking in front of the screen.
 
 The previous film I had watched, Certified Copy, was enthralling to me the entire length. It also was straightforward with constant dialogue (by the characters), but there was somehow a lot more to observe. I find it odd that I always find narratives far more interesting than documentaries. Documentaries are real. Perhaps because film is not real (I'm not physically interacting with it), it doesn't affect my pathos. Perhaps it's the control of emotions of narratives. The power of the art itself. That's what affects me. This film is lacking it.

A film with a normal thrill curve. A guilty pleasure. Perhaps the best of it's kind.
 
 The film is flawless. Like the director's last film A Separation (edit: This is wrong. That film turns out to be by Asghar Farhadi, another amazing Iranian director. The films are so similar! I assumed.), it focuses on a relationship in a single day. Again, very screenplay-heavy, the camera keeping the couple in the shot, shot naturally requiring less cinematography and more acting. The film plays like a ride with seemingly extremely few cuts; It's straightforward. It feels as if there's nothing to analyze.
 
 But I'll try, a little.
 
 The screenplay requires the actors to be top-notch to endure long takes, maintain realism, and especially to keep the film entirely ambiguous.
 
 The film feels quite universal, containing very familiar characters and events. I consider myself schizoid with characteristics very close to the male: I'm cold, use rationality over emotions, and have narrow interests. Not all males are as cold as me or the male in the film, but I bet many people can identify with many of either one of the character's characteristics. Moreover, I bet people know someone very much like the two characters shown.
 
 Certainly there are some slightly unbelievable things such as the symbolism of art in the film and the strangers met giving advice, one to the male, one to the female, making the screenplay perfect for what occurs in a single day, just as A Separation did. However, it didn't bother me. I was enthralled.
 
 I only wish Karaistami continues to show me a day in the life of a relationship, or any person. 1401 2013-12-30 12:08:35 2013-12-30 17:08:35 open closed copie-conforme publish 0 0 post 0 Film Reviews Films _edit_last 1 medium_post O:11:"Medium_Post":11:{s:16:"author_image_url";s:74:"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/200/200/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png";s:10:"author_url";s:28:"https://medium.com/@rahil627";s:11:"byline_name";N;s:12:"byline_email";N;s:10:"cross_link";s:2:"no";s:2:"id";s:12:"221a2160bbce";s:21:"follower_notification";s:3:"yes";s:7:"license";s:19:"all-rights-reserved";s:14:"publication_id";s:12:"7a04709b0155";s:6:"status";s:6:"public";s:3:"url";s:71:"https://medium.com/@rahil627/copie-conforme-certified-copy-221a2160bbce";} _yoast_wpseo_content_score 60 _yoast_wpseo_primary_category A Critical Analysis of Super Smash Bros.

 <strong>Preface</strong>
 It seems that I chose this game because of my love for it rather than a game whose critical analysis could lead to a new direction for the future of games. Nostalgia and subjectivity exist. Also, this analysis only focuses on versus mode with tournament settings.
 
 <strong>Body</strong>
 In my college there was a public room with three TVs, all of which solely had Super Smash Bros. Melee (SSBM). My friends and I used to watch videos of professionals play, be inspired, incorporate their skills into our tactics, then participate in regional tournaments, cheering local players. Clear now, but only in hindsight I realize it was a sport.
 
 What makes this game stand above other fighting games of its time is its accessibility. That’s Nintendo’s strength. It had simple controls, no button combinations to memorize, a short learning curve, and an eccentric, lovable selection of characters. This attracted diverse players whom later formed a similarly eccentric, lovable community.
 
 Despite its accessibility it has a complex, successful fighting system -- the more skilled player always win. There are several mechanics (rules) to the game leading to an infinite amount of possibility and therefore knowledge. Players explore the possibilities because they are motivated to win, incorporating newly found knowledge into their tactics. It’s a creative process. After 12 years people are still finding new possibilities; It’s existence at EVO 2013 exemplifies is longevity.
 
 However, complexity doesn’t necessarily prolong the life of the game, as proven by ancient games such as chess, but in this case it does help maintain excitement for a cartridge game, just as new content (maps) and core updates do for other competitive games. Perhaps there is even some satisfaction in learning a complex system. Many Asian gamers tend to play knowledge heavy, calculating games. It’s unnecessary, resulting in a higher competitive play learning curve, yet, requiring more skill.
 
 Another pro, especially compared to sports, is that SSBM has nearly no down time. As long as the match is running, there is likely something to do to gain advantage.
 
 A possible con of SSBM is that its complexity flows over to the input. Professional players need quick hands and great hand-eye coordination, practicing certain hand movements to execute advanced moves. I believe it’s sequel (SSBB) attempted to alleviate this by limiting the input, but it resulted in a less exciting game, especially to watch. Decisions need to be timed to generate excitement, but limiting input limits decisions, which limits possibilities.
 
 In my life, no other game or sport has created more exciting moments than matches of SSBM. And, just as any other sport, it is repayable, timeless.
 
 In 2011, indie game designers began creating accessible yet complex sports games. Will Hokra with its simplicity generate enough excitement to be taken seriously as ultimate flying disc did? Regardless of its outcome, I believe Super Smash Bros. Melee is a prominent precursor. 1417 2013-12-31 14:57:46 2013-12-31 19:57:46 open closed a-critical-analysis-of-super-smash-bros-melee publish 0 0 post 0 Game Reviews Games _edit_last 1 _yoast_wpseo_primary_category A Personal Statement for Game Design http://rahilpatel.com/blog/a-personal-statement-for-game-design Wed, 01 Jan 2014 22:52:39 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=1424 Written for a certain Game Design application.
 
 <strong>Preface</strong>
 The Internet service man is currently haphazardly pulling cable to my parent’s house in India in a way to avoid monkeys from snagging it. Pardon the superficial errors.
 
 <strong>Why I am interested</strong>
 Games are special to me because it is one form of social interaction that my personality consistently agrees to partake in, a social event that I feel creates a new experience every play, an alternative to socially normal events, which often fail to entice me.
 
 I self-diagnosed myself to have schizoid personality disorder (SPD). I often withdraw from social situations, have narrow focus, have trouble maintaining relationships, and am indifferent to social norms, yet, I often have strong a desire to interact with people. Nearly all of my close friends in my life were initially contacted through games. Games enabled me to be social in a way that doesn't make me anxious, and is something I actually enjoy. It wasn't until much later in life while living and travelling in new cities and the world that I began to interact in somewhat more socially normal ways. Without games I probably would be a hermit, a McCandless [Into the Wild]. Sounds like a lame teenage wallflower story, but I believe there's some rational, psychological reasoning behind the interactions between schizoids and games. My life is constantly experimenting and suffering from this.
 
 Despite my love for several arts, I think the interaction between people have a greater affect on people than the interaction between person(s) and an inanimate medium. It’s simple: moments are more memorable when shared.
 
 Lastly, there's just more to explore in games, interaction, urban spaces, new media, and that’s excluding its endless applications.
 
 <strong>Personal vision, impact on the field, speculation of thesis</strong>
 My life’s objective is this: I want to make people always feel that the world is a playground, that there's always the option to stay out, to physically explore, play, socialize, collaborate, with friends, family, and strangers of all classes of society alike, maximizing physical social time, therefore maximizing memories.
 
 When I travel I often have extreme, schizoid-affected feelings from external stimuli. I become extremely playful and overly confident, like a child. I want to explore everything, do everything, and talk to everyone. Empiricism; Learning through play. I often felt that I was the only one interacting with the people around me -- in a subway in Seoul, in craftsman shops in Malaysia, on the streets of Taipei -- while they were on their smartphones (probably maintaining relationships). I was outside all day everyday. I despised being indoors, hence my choice in Taipei, a very street-life oriented culture. I wondered why people didn't feel the same way. What people were thinking, if they were thinking, during their routines. I felt over time people, including me, narrow their life to their work, friends, and family, forgetting the world of possibilities. During this time, I saw gaps in society where people are so in routine that fail to maximize their life’s time -- on public transportation, lone jobs (small shops, night shifts), and in developed cities without street life (Japan, Western world).
 
 Games can fit these gaps. Public games. Played with the people around. Something anyone can stumble over in a city: in the park, on the subway, inside, and outside. Games should be a part of everyday life. Turn that lonely down time to social game time. Relieve oneself through gameplay, prevent the social barrier from forming, talk to people, and maintain playfulness. Playfulness begets confidence.
 
 A speculation: games in New York public transportation systems to encourage meaningful interaction between strangers via inquiry, without an electronic device.
 
 I prefer public art (and games) to an easily distributable medium because it affects anyone nearby. The audience isn't narrow. Even if the art is infused on a medium, it should be placed in public a la Babycastle’s public arcades.
 
 In the 1980’s Fluxus wrote "Learning through conversation, inquiring, group play, and games serves as the most effective educational model for the future generation who will live in the information society.” In the same vain I believe that even games without a specific purpose such as learning or research will return positive results because one is interacting with new people. Simply putting a diverse group of people in the same space to interact can lead to powerful outcomes. A good social event is an interactive one.
 
 Another speculation: Big games that have a specific positive affect to the environment: to clean trash, generate power, help the needy, teach, log and map data, etc. If people cannot do something creative, at least they can do something productive.
 
 <strong>Why select focus, what I can contribute to a team, and what makes me a strong candidate</strong>
 On a team I can contribute to game design and implementation (including programming). I'm a DIY problem-solver type that narrowly focuses on interaction and gameplay, so much so that I feel technology gets in the way. Naturally game design will be my focus, but I’m really interested in specific ITP courses to gain more knowledge and possibility.
 
 I believe my strength (and weakness) is retaining the idealistic, child-like vision of play, and my desire for universalism. I’ve lost care for digital games because of my time in Asia.
 
 The main reason I want to go to school is because I no longer want to create games alone; Game development should be interactive. Also, I have great peers in New York.
 
 Perhaps the underlying grandiose reason of why I want to enter game design is so that I myself can maintain those child-like feelings. To live, learn, and play, simultaneously; To avoid narrowing my focus to work, getting bored, withdrawing, changing direction, moving, again, as I've always done.
 
 <strong>Epilogue</strong>
 After writing this, I noticed there’s a lot of feelings and a lack of direction, more fitting for ITP, yet I feel that there is a clear love for games itself, particularly its replayability.

 I watched this during a depression, which turns out to be a very good time for watching movies, as I can easily focus on it. I watched it because the Wikipedia page of Edward Yang claims it rekindled his passion for film. He probably saw it in the late 70s.
 
 Immediately, I was engrossed. The valleyside of mountains of Peru (or so it is told), people marching steeply down clouds, the contrast of spanish soldiers dressed for dinner and raw tribal people, a lack of reason why everything is spoken in German, modern music (timeless, even for 2014) that set the feel of a modern, non-sensical, anxiety-ridden epic.
 
 I just watch in wonder, allowing the pagan theme to meander along with the river. The plot and decisions made by characters are nonsensical. It's the feeling provoked by the realism of the setting: a forest which reminds me of my time flowing down the Mekong in Laos, The Deer Hunter, and obviously Apocalypse Now; tribal people and local animals are shown often. Also the stark realism of decisions that may have occurred in the past due to the lack of intelligence: placing the black man in front during battle because Indians might be scared of him, and later using similar reasoning to keep the horse, which when finally abandoned eerily stares back at the camera with a blue and white mask.
 
 Action is rarely shown, and when it is, it's quick, without drama. People die, but it doesn't matter, nothing matters in this world. There's just a feel of constant impending doom, like a shitty H.P. Lovecraft book.
 
 There's this random colorful crew of Spanish soldiers with two princesses, a monk, a silly man made emperor, a black man, a tribal man, a tribal prince all on a raft on a river in the netherworld, and the only thing the characters (and the viewer) can do is watch Aguirre advance them further into their doom.
 
 Although nothing matters in the film, the film is somehow entirely enthralling. 1438 2014-01-05 14:26:56 2014-01-05 19:26:56 open closed aguirre-the-wrath-of-god publish 0 0 post 0 Film Reviews Films _edit_last 1 medium_post O:11:"Medium_Post":11:{s:16:"author_image_url";s:74:"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/200/200/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png";s:10:"author_url";s:28:"https://medium.com/@rahil627";s:11:"byline_name";N;s:12:"byline_email";N;s:10:"cross_link";s:2:"no";s:2:"id";s:12:"d8922d1d5622";s:21:"follower_notification";s:3:"yes";s:7:"license";s:19:"all-rights-reserved";s:14:"publication_id";s:12:"7a04709b0155";s:6:"status";s:6:"public";s:3:"url";s:90:"https://medium.com/@rahil627/aguirre-der-zorn-gottes-aguirre-the-wrath-of-god-d8922d1d5622";} _yoast_wpseo_content_score 30 _yoast_wpseo_primary_category Cidade dos Homens (City of Men) http://rahilpatel.com/blog/cidade-dos-homens Sat, 11 Jan 2014 22:04:38 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=1501 I found the film from a stand in India. I bought it for a few rupees, along with a bunch of old Indian music. The cheap paper cover indicated that it was the TV series, with an episode listing on the back. I continued watching, unsure of whether it was a TV series or film, learning the truth half way.
 
 Watching Cidade dos Homens (City of Men), which is based off of the TV series, which itself is a spin-of of Cidade de Deus (City of God), which I really liked when I saw it in high school, felt like a prolonged TV episode, as many TV show turned films do.
 
 Perhaps I've been really high on life and barely appreciating even high art because I was not engaged in the film at all. It has a gritty setting: gangs, guns, local people 'n all, but the dramedy elements just consistently destroyed the realism. In one instance, One of the main characters has sex on duty, and it trades scenes with his friend also having sex, funky brazilian music plays, it segues on to the next scene; It felt like a sitcom. It's light-hearted. Yet, people have guns, people die, and I can't feel for them because these elements distract me from the events that occur.
 
 I thought about something Tsai Ming-Liang said: Films are not real. People shouldn't have to get so engaged with a film. It's only a screen. It's weird that people go festivals, then go into theater rooms, just to watch something on the screen.
 
 In another thought, I felt that there was a truth in feeling of the film. People in Rio de Janerio do have guns, yet people have to live on, and joy is part of life. During my second time in India, I'd walk down the street, past slums, still thinking about people suffering, but a bit less than the first time, focusing on something insignificant, like purchasing a bottle of Thums Up (an Indian brand of cola). People adapt. It's only crazy from a foreigner's point of view.
 
 I started fast forwarding half way through; I can't withstand TV shows. I'd watch the first few second of a scene and understand the rest, and continue watching with this method. At some points I'd peer into the setting, the favelas, wishing I could walk the streets, talk to people, and really understand life there. I felt that there was so much film in the setting that could have been made with just a few of the people. Closer to the people. With less dialog, less narrative. Maybe I just want to physically be there and not watch a film.
 
 The film ended rather quick at an hour and a half, as much of it was fast forwarded. Maybe I've become an asshole critic who is unable to enjoy action films. Still, it's only an action film. 1501 2014-01-11 17:04:38 2014-01-11 22:04:38 open closed cidade-dos-homens publish 0 0 post 0 Film Reviews Films _edit_last 1 _wp_old_slug cidade-dos-homens-city-of-men medium_post O:11:"Medium_Post":11:{s:16:"author_image_url";s:74:"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/200/200/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png";s:10:"author_url";s:28:"https://medium.com/@rahil627";s:11:"byline_name";N;s:12:"byline_email";N;s:10:"cross_link";s:2:"no";s:2:"id";s:12:"a2a280a9362f";s:21:"follower_notification";s:3:"yes";s:7:"license";s:19:"all-rights-reserved";s:14:"publication_id";s:12:"7a04709b0155";s:6:"status";s:6:"public";s:3:"url";s:71:"https://medium.com/@rahil627/cidade-dos-homens-city-of-men-a2a280a9362f";} _yoast_wpseo_content_score 60 _yoast_wpseo_primary_category 愛情萬歲 (Vive L'Amour) http://rahilpatel.com/blog/vive-lamour Sun, 12 Jan 2014 18:36:45 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=1520 I watched Vive L'Amour (愛情萬歲; Live Love) at a coincidental time. Just a few weeks ago, I was extremely social. I had class, friends within the locality, always eating with people, not spending more than an hour without talking to someone. Now, I'm in a large house, staying up late to take on personal endeavors, with no social life. The sudden change in social life caused bed-ridden depression instantly, but I eventually adapted to live alone, again.
 
 In Vive L'Amour, there are only three characters. Nothing else. We just watch them, without distractions -- sound and dialog. It feels as if so much time is going by in their lives without doing anything. Sometimes I felt as if I'm not doing anything. Yet, it is enthralling to watch, think, and feel. Although, admittedly, I took breaks to handle the extremely slow pace, I never fast forwarded.
 
 The setting is naturalistic. One character sells coffins, another illegally sells clothes, and the last is a real estate agent. The rest of the world feels bleak. The bland side of Taiwan: ugly condos and cars. It's how I feel whenever I think about the Xinyi district in Taipei.
 
 The actions characters take are novel [to me], adding to realism. bowling a watermelon, stealing keys to an apartment and then sleeping in it. Other scenes are relatable. The younger male character (acted by Lee Kang Sheng) takes actions not uncommon during puberty: masturbating and wearing girl's clothes.
 
 The dramatic tension caused by the characters being close, yet anonymous, is great to experience. The climax is unbreathably tense and thrilling. The final scene ends it well, with a long shot of an desolate park, then the female character quietly uncontrollably cries, finally physically displaying the real emotion beneath all of the characters: extreme loneliness.
 
 I felt that Tsai Ming-Liang [the director] figured out what worked in Rebels of the Neon God, and stripped everything else, which wasn't much, out. The audience now focuses only on the action, often of just one character. It's rather surprising to think how great a minimal film can be, and how few resources is required to make one. It's a success. 1520 2014-01-12 13:36:45 2014-01-12 18:36:45 open closed vive-lamour publish 0 0 post 0 Film Reviews Films _edit_last 1 _yoast_wpseo_content_score 90 _yoast_wpseo_primary_category Distance http://rahilpatel.com/blog/distance Fri, 17 Jan 2014 21:45:19 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=1571 [todo: only an English title?

 Prologue:
 I didn't know about the event it's based on, just as I didn't know about the event Nobody Knows was based on.
 
 Body:
 Distance by Hirokazu Koreeda is powerful because the psychology of the characters feel real, and it questions the differences between perpetrators and non-perpetrators.
 
 The film starts with a sci-fi plot. A cult-titled group of people poisoned Tokyo waters, which kills and injures many. Gladly, it's not a sci-fi flick either.
 
 It quickly jumps to real characters shown in their natural settings, a glimpse of each character's lives. Each character with a different personality and time in life.
 
 They meet in pairs. Then, altogether, they embark their journey, and it feels like a travel film, one of a group of friends who haven't met for quite some time. A hand-held camera follows the action, by car and by foot. As they meet each other, we (the audience) also meet them, understand them, and feel for them.
 
 Once the car is gone, a sense of horror emerges. Gladly, it's not a horror flick. Although, the rest of the film remains haunting.
 
 After mourning the group's car gets stolen and they meet with one of the remaining cult members and sleep at the cult's hideout. It becomes night. The camera gives a beautiful dark hue. The character's emotions are mirrored by their dark images, splotches of black across their face.
 
 Flashbacks of their cult counterparts string more bits of story, before and after they joined the cult. Before, they are shown in a mystic atmosphere, appearing quite normal. After, quite crazy when in contact with normal society.
 
 Flashback interviews of each relative at a previous time, probably real interviews of each actor as Koreeda conducted for After Life and previous documentary works, adds even more realism and character.
 
 As with watching any of Koreeda's films, one deeply contemplates. The film's lack of action and consistent display of characters asks for contemplation. About the character's lives (the family's relatives), their cult siblings, and how the average person can be swayed into doing something wrong without feeling one is doing something wrong. The difference between good and bad is a state of psychology.
 
 As the relatives sit in the living room or around a fire, and contemplate about their siblings, god, and life, one can imagine them as a cult. How are the different from their siblings? If they stay in that room for a long period of time, would they begin to develop certain values different from the norms of society? How do societies develop? If any group of people is stuck in a room, what are the chances of the outcome being wrong?
 
 Instead of directly showing motives, who, what, or why something wrong happens, we take a moment to conjecture how something wrong forms, and in doing so, it provides a more truthful answer.
 
 Epilogue:
 It's been 1 year and 3 months since I left the States. This film strikes the first moment I've spent hours afterwards in wonder. 1571 2014-01-17 16:45:19 2014-01-17 21:45:19 open closed distance publish 0 0 post 0 Film Reviews Films _edit_last 1 _yoast_wpseo_content_score 60 _yoast_wpseo_primary_category Proteus http://rahilpatel.com/blog/proteus Tue, 21 Jan 2014 21:04:40 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=1583 I decided to play a game, alone.
 
 It has been a very long time. Steam informs me almost a year.
 
 It's weird to do something alone now.
 
 I tried Costume Quest, and despite it having a funny little script, good humor, a Halloween theme, nostalgia of my upbringing in suburban America, and an all around great production, it's still a genre game. Therefore it did not appeal to me. Furthermore it carries over the cons of JRPGs: chore quests like finding things, a JRPG battle system of which numbers do not matter and fighting requires no tactics or brainpower, 'n some other junk. I stopped very early in.
 
 Then I played Proteus. I walked from one side of the island to the other, at awe at the visual and audio, quickly concluding it was a simple audio-visual experience. It reminded me of a 3d version of <a href="http://archive.globalgamejam.org/2012/seasons-0">Seasons</a> [made during NY GGJ 2012]. Something fitting as an installation piece at a museum.
 
 I nearly turned it off. I didn't. Instead, I decided to circle the island, just to soak it in for a few more minutes.
 
 That was a crucial decision point. The first 5 minutes of any media. And it was successful.
 
 I played through the rest of the game. Exploring. Every sight picture worthy. Interacting with everything, wanting to hear what new sounds come, what new animation occurs. The little crabs and their tribal drum music, the bunny-like creatures, the amazing sounding owl, the elusive white bunny, dandelion seed heads floating about, stars, fireflies. And through all the seasons. A partly cloudy beautiful spring, an equally beautiful summer, looking into the sun causes vision to go white, autumn brings the leaves down and even more rain and clouds just below the mountain, and the climactic, dreamy winter. It was like traveling through a digital world, with all the interactions in tact. Traveling, while in reality it's raining outside and I'm on my computer.
 
 Perhaps it's not much of a game, as there aren't many rules. It takes a single element found in many great games, exploration, and singles it out, resulting in a minimalist experience. The slow-moving, cinematic, 3d exploration of Shadow of the Colossus or any Bethesda game. Then adding a little interaction. Perhaps it's proof, proof that games can evoke feelings.
 
 Nah, never mind that thought. There just isn't enough game to prove that here. It's an audio-visual experience with very little input. My proof of this statement via thought experiment: If I had watched the game instead of playing it, I think it would have offered the same experience.
 
 Game or not, it's a worthy experience, one I value more than most of the games available on Steam.
 
 
 Something worth mentioning: <a href="http://vimeo.com/47943812">Bad Trip</a> by Alan Kwan has a similar exploratory feel with little interaction, with the addition of containing memories of its creator. 1583 2014-01-21 16:04:40 2014-01-21 21:04:40 open closed proteus publish 0 0 post 0 Game Reviews Games _edit_last 1 幫幫我愛神 (Help me, Eros) http://rahilpatel.com/blog/%e5%b9%ab%e5%b9%ab%e6%88%91%e6%84%9b%e7%a5%9e Sat, 01 Feb 2014 15:00:25 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=1598 [todo: use English title in hyperlink]
 
 I coincidentally watched 幫幫我愛神 (Help me, Eros) directed by 李康生 (Lee Kang Sheng) and produced by long-time collaborator 蔡明亮 (Tsai Ming Liang) during a depression.
 
 Similar to Tsai Ming Liang's films, it's minimalist, containing four characters, all of whom suffer from city isolation.
 
 Compared to Tsai Ming Liang's early films (Rebels of the Neon God and Vive L’Amour), Help me, Eros has more fantastic elements. It contains at least one dream, and the sex scene is quite dreamy too. The eccentric costumes of betel nut girls, the neon lights of the stand, the upscale apartments, all add to the fantastic atmosphere.
 
 Yet, it is nearly all naturally shot in some random city in Taiwan. The blend of contemporary realism and fantasy forms a dark reality. The call center and stock market provide a good view of underrepresented occupations at the time. Betel nut beauties are real too [I live in Taiwan]. Technology is included, with the use of instant messaging, even more specifically a situation where the profile picture is used, and even the Asian-necessary selfie. Another great example of the blend: brand printed logos (think Gucci) are shot across the bodies of the characters during a threesome.
 
 The isolation here is possibly even more extreme, perhaps at the sacrifice of realism, than Tsai's early films. A tub full of eels, an ostrich omelette, fucking three girls simultaneously, marijuana plants, millions of dollars wasted, a carp being scraped alive, an ostrich fetus. Gluttony of extremely isolated people in Taiwan. Something that probably has never been shown before.
 
 Yet, despite the extremes, the characters feel real. Betel nut beauties derived from a marketing campaign in a farming area in Taiwan. At one point the Betel nut girl goes back to farm, crying, missing a moment she had, only to come back and proceed to sell Betel nuts. The chubby character Cupcake is fat because her boyfriend is in the army, and later found dead by poison. The main character is a trope, but even I've experienced a few people like him in my life: rich and lonely.
 
 The film plays fine throughout at a familiar pace. I didn't have to take a break.
 
 Still, for some reason, perhaps it was the fantastic elements, or the lack of dramatic elements, or even my own state of depression, the climax of the film didn't have a profound effect on me as Tsai's earlier films have. The characters are there, but I cared less for them. Perhaps it is because the characters are older, already transformed and fallen into their occupations. In Tsai's earlier films, the characters are younger, the arcade street kid in Rebels... and a masturbating teen in Vive L’Amour are relatable. Help Me, Eros felt more like an observance of underserved people in extreme states. There is little transformation of the characters. Actually, now that I think about it, there is none. All of the positive actions failed; Nothing changes. All of the characters continue on their initial path, deceived by hope during loneliness. 1598 2014-02-01 10:00:25 2014-02-01 15:00:25 open closed %e5%b9%ab%e5%b9%ab%e6%88%91%e6%84%9b%e7%a5%9e publish 0 0 post 0 Film Reviews Films _edit_last 1 medium_post O:11:"Medium_Post":11:{s:16:"author_image_url";s:74:"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/200/200/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png";s:10:"author_url";s:28:"https://medium.com/@rahil627";s:11:"byline_name";N;s:12:"byline_email";N;s:10:"cross_link";s:2:"no";s:2:"id";s:12:"e186c96cd4eb";s:21:"follower_notification";s:3:"yes";s:7:"license";s:19:"all-rights-reserved";s:14:"publication_id";s:12:"7a04709b0155";s:6:"status";s:6:"public";s:3:"url";s:100:"https://medium.com/@rahil627/%E5%B9%AB%E5%B9%AB%E6%88%91%E6%84%9B%E7%A5%9E-help-me-eros-e186c96cd4eb";} _yoast_wpseo_content_score 30 _yoast_wpseo_primary_category 河流 (The River) http://rahilpatel.com/blog/%e6%b2%b3%e6%b5%81 Thu, 06 Feb 2014 15:14:00 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=1612 [todo: change hyperlink to English title]
 
 I watched 河流 (The River) in a still funky mood, unable to respond to external stimuli, isolated from the world.
 
 The more films of Tsai Ming-Liang I watch, the more I feel similar to him. Or is it, because my current state of depression that I feel similar to the feelings his films express?
 
 Like Tsai's other films, it contains common themes: extreme isolation, water leaks, a slow, contemplative pace, and even similar characters. After watching a few of his films, one starts to believe that the main character is based on him, and perhaps the family is based off his own. Maybe his films are the extremes of his family.
 
 When I started traveling, I had fascination with what people do, especially craftsmen that could be seen on the first level of buildings, or on streets of Asia. Similarly, I feel Tsai has this fascination as the processes of a chiropractor, acupuncture, prayers, and other traditional ceremonies are shown. He also has an eye for unseen places: a traditional bathhouse, a temple, old apartments, a river. Tsai sees the world as a traveler, a foreigner, and therefore it is interesting, because everything feels new. As Jenova Chen states in one of the three ways games could effect adults as they do children, the film "intellectually, whereby the work reveals a new perspective about the world that you have not seen before."
 
 A random note: Media is always shown on the side in his films. It seems he feels media is not real. It shouldn't affect the lives of people so much.
 
 Kang's character is selfish, independent, yet needs help, nurture. When near his father he doesn't feel hungry. He's not experiencing life during these times. He needs be on his own.
 
 The film is overwhelmingly bleak. Although there are very tension-ridden scenes, I didn't feel as much drama here as his first two films because of the bleakness. Still there are very strong scenes.
 
 After a male Oedipus Rex plot twist, there's an image of his father, black and blue hues with a speck of white light in his eyes that haunts far after, which segues into the main character going into the light, unwittingly.
 
 The strongest scene for me was the mother's reaction after seeing her son in the hospital. She leans in an elevator, pressing the close button and random floors, unable to make her next move. Actually, the scene sums the film. All of the characters suffer like neck pain from extreme isolation, a lack of nurture, and love. Out of desperation, they look for nurture in wrong places, unable to move on, stuck, in an elevator. 1612 2014-02-06 10:14:00 2014-02-06 15:14:00 open closed %e6%b2%b3%e6%b5%81 publish 0 0 post 0 Film Reviews Films _edit_last 1 _yoast_wpseo_content_score 60 _yoast_wpseo_primary_category medium_post O:11:"Medium_Post":11:{s:16:"author_image_url";s:74:"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/200/200/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png";s:10:"author_url";s:28:"https://medium.com/@rahil627";s:11:"byline_name";N;s:12:"byline_email";N;s:10:"cross_link";s:2:"no";s:2:"id";s:12:"a06e72d890d0";s:21:"follower_notification";s:3:"yes";s:7:"license";s:19:"all-rights-reserved";s:14:"publication_id";s:12:"7a04709b0155";s:6:"status";s:6:"public";s:3:"url";s:70:"https://medium.com/@rahil627/%E6%B2%B3%E6%B5%81-the-river-a06e72d890d0";} A Self-assessment http://rahilpatel.com/blog/a-self-assessment Sun, 15 Dec 2013 13:30:40 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=1775 [note: this format was later used for my resume, which was updated, but private]

 Taiwan, then New York?
 The year I go back to work. Will I be able to balance work and life, America and Asia? Work on the streets, sleep on the streets. Vive l'amour.

 India
 Break time.
 
 September 2013 - November 2013
 Study in Taiwan
 Back to my travel's first love. Learn Chinese. 加油！
 
 July 2013 - September 2013
 Travel East Asia
 I quickly went through Hong Kong, South Korea, and Japan to determine which is the best place to live and work. I spent around two weeks in Hong Kong and Japan, and the rest of the time in Seoul because I was working on Crystal Brawl. I still travelled, but developed East Asia is not nearly as social and fun as undeveloped South Asia. I talked to or tried talking to people from contemporary art institutions and universities, checking out the art scene from a public perspective, trying to push myself in to no avail. Despite their advances in development, I decided Taiwan is best.
 
 June - July 2013
 Living in India
 Less work, more life.
 
 May - June 2013
 Travel in Nepal and northeast India
 I escaped the heat of Gujarat, India and went to Nepal and northeast India with a childhood friend. I spent some more time living in small towns enjoying the relaxed nature of people of mountainous regions whilst making games when everyone slept.
 
 February - April 2013
 Living in India
 The idea was to be a hermit independent game developer in India, rent-free and worry-free. The idea failed for several reasons realized afterwards. I cannot work alone; I must work with local people. Working alone leads to an unhealthy daily life, especially working on computers. It just didn't make sense. I need to have a community of people to live and work regularly.
 
 A friend from New York came for a month. We were slated to make a game, but we both came to the conclusion that making a game in India did not make sense and instead created a game development workshop and game jam at a nearby university.
 
 August 2011 – February 2012
 Travel in Taiwan and Indochina
 An unhealthy amount of overconsumption in sights, food, and life. After volunteering at the school in Taiwan, I travelled around the island that is Taiwan (some via CouchSurfing), made a short film in Malaysia (see Roti Delivery), and pondered in Bangkok, deciding to give up work and do some proper traveling. I left my crap at a hostel and made a short motorcycle trip in northwest Thailand. Wanting to further distance myself from development, I seeked indigenous people in Laos, staying in their villages.
 
 An overall psychologically menacing trip for a introverted personality who enjoys late night brainy work and despises conspicuous consumption. I constantly struggled to find value for my time. The language barrier of Southeast Asia undeniably blocked my desire to closely connect with lower class people on many occasions. But as usual, I don't regret it.
 
 August - September 2012
 Volunteer at 達達美語補習班 (Dada School) in 中壢 (ZhongLi), 台湾 (Taiwan)
 This was my first gig during travel. One of the things I wanted to do while traveling was to try things that I value more than private sector work, in this case, teaching. Perhaps it's why I avoided to take a job at a psychologically abusive social game startup and instead chose to travel and ultimately live and work independently in India.
 
 It was a work exchange at an independent school run by a fantastic couple: John and Ching. I assisted in teaching kids English by creating activities for younger students and having conversation with elder students. I also did general work: house chores, cooking, and babysitting. It felt like living with a great family rather than working. I wish I did more. Perhaps it was the heat (and lack of air conditioner), or the mosquitoes at night, or Ching's delicious food that hindered me. I stayed until my visa nearly ran out.
 
 March 2012 - July 2012?
 Independent Game Developer in San Francisco
 I went back without a job to see what San Francisco really offered me. I spent most of the time working on Pinkies Up, and staying open for collaboration. I concluded San Francisco is too gentrified and too business oriented, consisting of shallow business-card trading meetups and funding the next Instagram clone. The city lost its heart. The only exception: The MADE in Oakland and Creative Coders.
 
 January - February 2012
 Volunteer at Babycastles in Brooklyn, NY
 Ahhh my first love. Amazing people doing amazing things. It was specifically what I was interested in, but had no idea a community for it existed. It was what I was looking for all along. At the time I was just beginning to create things myself (game prototypes), figuring out what games are, what it means to be an artist, and really delve into fine arts. The things these people accomplished on a daily basis was unbelievable. I merely helped setup and facilitate art game installations, and helped (or worsened) with organizational development. I regret leaving New York because of these people, and I will come back, despite disliking the city.
 
 January - February 2012
 Intern at zdLLdz in Brooklyn, NY
 Interning with Zack. Woo! I assisted with a film shoot in the freezing cold and researched stereoscopy in film and games (read: ate pizza and watched dope movies). Still, it was inspiring to just be around Zack. Zack is the future, and the other interns are equally futuristic.
 
 February - May 2011
 QA and Release Engineer at Perfect World Entertainment in Foster City, CA
 From suburb to city, I picked up a new job too quickly, perhaps afraid of financial risk. I oversaw day-to-day tasks for the engineering department. The department creates and manages websites and web servers for a bunch of shitty Asian MMORPGs. It was a cumbersome process in a large company. Unrealistic goals, overtime, hasty testing, shoving out *milestones*; The stereotyped horrifically inefficient software company. I knew and warned that I was going to leave within the first week, but I stuck to the job because I was still absorbing the experience, mainly related to living in San Francisco. I tried to help the company as much as I could but I came to the conclusion that my radical (in their perspective) input was meaningless in a large company, and my desire for something more meaningful, or at least more meaningful than managing websites for terribly bland MMORPGs, made me leave.
 
 February - October 2010
 Software Developer at Segin Systems in Virginia Beach, VA
 My first "professional" job. I developed code for their flagship web based real estate software. Most of the time was spent implementing interfaces to scrape data from ancient third party title software databases to be sent via web services. The rest of the time was spent extending the superbly coded web site, written by the lead developer who made fine use of the .NET framework. An amazing first programming job as there were only two other developers, and most of the time was spent programming. I knew I was going to leave my hometown, but I thought it was best to have a little "experience" before doing so.
 
 August 2005 - May 2009
 Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at Old Dominion University in Norfolk, VA
 I wasted a lot of time. Only one class was okay, the one where our class was told to build a web forum with few restrictions. I did, however, value the time I watched artsy movies and spent with my friends, often playing games, almost solely Super Smash Bros. Melee.
 
 2003 - Death
 Temporary Manager at Village Motel in Chesapeake, VA
 This is my Dad's motel. Yep, I'm the second generation of the stereotype Indian immigrant hospitality-business owning family. It's what paid for my raising, including college. A stable business to raise a family. It takes a surprising amount of civil engineering and hackery to maintain motels.
 
 Childhood:
 Playing games with friends, biking, exploring neighborhoods, eating, family vacations, family events (Indian marriages), fixing computers, fixing other things, staying up late, waking up late, always doing something. 1775 2013-12-15 08:30:40 2013-12-15 13:30:40 open closed a-self-assessment publish 0 0 post 0 Personal Self-assessment _edit_last 1 _yoast_wpseo_primary_category Japanese Arcades http://rahilpatel.com/blog/japanese-arcades Thu, 19 Sep 2013 10:24:09 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=2139 9/14/13 written in Japan:

 JAPANESE ARCADE GAME REPORT:
 
 games that I thought were fun:
 http://kotaku.com/5984491/in-this-racing-game-you-shake-a-pig
 - amazing GIF comments
 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkF72uxDm-g
 
 Oh my. Just found this on the internet in related videos:
 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8cTdFqwdwc
 
 Otherwise, the arcades are all very similar. So similar that genres are physically separated by floors: CLAW MACHINES and photo booths, technical / RTS (very calculating, army strategy, cards that are read digitally games, simulators), gambling (panchinko, mahjong), music (DDR, the ones I linked), and normal (mario kart racing machines, armored core with dual joysticks, retro, fighters, etc.).
 
 written now:
 I went to a few arcades in Tokyo. It was a very odd experience. I guess not too different from entering an arcade in a mall, just larger.
 
 The games were separated in a way that fit the desires of its intended audience.
 
 The first floor often had photo-booths and claw machines. Feminine people went to photo-booths. Couples went to claw machines.
 
 Females and males, perhaps equally, enjoy the rhythm games. It was also perhaps the most social area. People would play a DDR game, watch, and talk.
 
 Males usually enjoy the technical, calculating, statistics-based games. Some of these games were really really in depth. It felt like a weird office. I imagine they make good stock market brokers.
 
 The gambling games floor were full of smoke and old dudes and few dudetts wasting their life away, similar to Panchinko parlors. It was also unbearably loud and smelly. Actually, my Dad plays a lot of FreeCell, so perhaps it also has that meditative feeling of no-brain smartphone games. I never quite understood, but people do enjoy it, especially after a long day of work. Though, those people didn't seem as if they had work either.
 
 The first floor is where it's at. In addition to the claw machines and photo-booths, there's a bunch of random games thrown together. In one arcade, there were two games in the front: a Taiko (drum) rhythm game and a racing game with a pig controller. These two games attracted the most diverse audience, likely hence their placement at the front. Multiplayer Mario Kart is always good too. Anything more complex failed in attracting a diverse audience, including those two joystick robot fighting games.
 
 From my perspective, nearly all of it was odd, and I wanted no part in it. This was quite a surprise as I grew up with games. But here, it really felt a social barrier existed. There wasn't any couches, or a place for food. It was just games. The designers of Japanese arcades entirely missed the social aspect of arcades.
 
 For the most part, the people who played were really did fit the stereotypes the games were directed toward. The arcade player, the old panchinko dude, young girls at photo-booths, and random passer-byers for the games in the front and claw machines.
 
 There was also a feeling that many people came after work for some time of relief from life. It was apparent at many moments, as they're still wearing their business clothes. Some even come for lunch break, which I thought is kind of awesome.
 
 Otherwise, as a person who likes games, a disappointment. I believe I only stayed in Tokyo for a week, but from what I experienced, I am glad to not have gone to Japan directly after college, as I had actually thought about. Japan might have games, but they are insular.
 
 I guess the nice Nintendo games are intended for houses, and "arcade games" are intended for arcades.
 
 Arcades in America have nearly died out, especially so in cities. People who like games are saddened by this because games are part of culture, and a space with games was likely a part of their lives. I agree, but these Japanese arcades, which are quite similar to the arcades one finds inside of a mall in an American suburb, failed to progress with time. They are relics. America doesn't really need these, it needs a new arcade. 2139 2013-09-19 06:24:09 2013-09-19 10:24:09 open closed japanese-arcades publish 0 0 post 0 Game Design Games Japan Thoughts Travel _edit_last 1 _oembed_8ae3e5020e5a56cce9e4b5684fa13bf5 <iframe width="620" height="465" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/O8cTdFqwdwc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe> _oembed_ef61b723ba22eeeb25043eac4a6f2cc3 <iframe width="620" height="349" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xkF72uxDm-g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe> _oembed_70cd30d4d5691120250ed24ecbc8748c <iframe width="620" height="349" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/w_xZKKt_zic?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe> _oembed_54976067daf33e649bf12b1226cb56b0 <iframe width="620" height="349" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/0VFOCChBpew?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe> _oembed_5e19c175ede522d1d4244884362b6979 {{unknown}} A Personal Statement for Design And Technology http://rahilpatel.com/blog/a-personal-statement-for-design-and-technology Sat, 11 Jan 2014 16:20:20 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=2160 Written for a certain program's application.
 
 <strong>Outline reasons for applying to the program</strong>
 The reason I’m applying is because I want to place myself among diverse people with great potential. I’ve been traveling for the past year or so, and I still haven’t been to a place as publicly accessible for human development as New York. I plan to go back, and I want to start it right.
 
 In my experience, compared to NYU ITP, Parson’s alumni seem a bit better rounded. I probably fit the NYU ITP stereotype: overly excited, inconsistent, ambitious, childish; I think I’d work well with a more straight edged Parson’s person, providing the impulse in the team, as I have with past collaborators. I can do the crazy fun experimentation in my free time (Babycastles!).
 
 I also think the curriculum is better suited to create relationships. Collaboration studio and research labs are really appealing to me. The ITP-like electives are still there too.
 
 In what ways will I contribute to the program
 Myself: my crazy street-life perspective, my need for universalism – everyone in the world should be able to play my games, my need to have fun while doing all of this, my reluctance to compromise, pushing myself, the people around me, and hopefully, design.
 
 <strong>Thoughtful description of my background</strong>
 [Replacing with description of self, as my background is covered in resume and portfolio]
 
 I self-diagnosed myself to have schizoid personality disorder (SPD). I often withdraw from social situations, have narrow focus, have trouble maintaining relationships, and am indifferent to social norms, despite all of this, I require interaction with people, especially those that I admire or have similar objectives, even if my objectives often change. I rely on communities and/or games to be social. I've been struggling with interaction with people my whole life.
 
 <strong>Tentative plan of study or area of inquiry in the field as I envision it</strong>
 When I travel I often have extreme, schizoid-affected feelings from external stimuli. I become extremely playful and confident, as I was in my childhood. I want to explore everything, do everything, and talk to everyone; Empiricism; Learning through play. 
 
 My life’s objective is this: I want to make people always feel that the world is a playground, the way I feel while traveling, that there's always the option to stay out, to physically explore, play, socialize, collaborate, with friends, family, and strangers of all classes of society alike, maximizing physical social time, therefore maximizing memories.
 
 I think in daily life useful interaction can be maximized, filling in non-interactive gaps -- public interaction via big games, played with the people around, something anyone can stumble over in a city: in the park, on the subway, inside, and outside; To decrease academic and art barriers, to prevent the social barrier from forming, talk to people, and maintain playfulness. Playfulness begets confidence.
 
 I want to spend time thinking about how to increase meaningful public interaction, especially different classes of society, via thought experiments, and design several solutions on paper. I want to find more ways for people to extract information from the physical world, including people. I want people to interact more physically.
 
 <strong>Professional goals</strong>
 Create non-digital public games. Create a game that results a positive influence on society. Create a specific, useful application or device. Research public interaction, and perhaps the psychological influences it has on people, especially those with schizoid-like symptoms. Start a professional new media studio.
 
 <strong>How graduate program will help realize goals</strong>
 People, time, equipment, studio-type classes, current workshops, and professors. Isn’t that how art schools work? If I run a physical public game jam, I can expect people to come. I think the studio courses will help me manage a studio.
 
 <strong>Address anticipated opportunities and challenges</strong>
 I anticipate working with companies via collaborative studio, join research labs for specific applications: education, biotechnology, etc; assist professors with their research.
 
 I also think it would be nice to collaborate with other departments for more artsy things.
 
 The challenge won’t be to create art or a product; I can do that. The challenge will be to consistently, positively impact society, and eat while doing it.
 
 <strong>Future career expectations</strong>
 Installation maker at the American Museum of Natural History. Playground designer. Elementary school activity maker. MIT-researcher for biotechnology media. Useful toolmaker for medicine and education.
 
 Contrarily, I’d probably be content living in New York, doing a simple job, collaborating with artist friends, many I hope will come from graduate school.

 This post started as a tool for gauging direction using past thoughts, but with some organization (to the discontent of Wordpress's organization), it now resembles a philosophical corpus of a child.
 
 The asterisks (*) have nothing to do with the quality of the content or even the content of the post, rather, it is the importance of the idea to me, as a way of gauging future directions, spaces to explore, [spaces] worth exploring.
 
 original post:
 These are posts I felt either are aiming at ideals, are ongoing, or are worth thinking about some more, or pursuing. Nearly all of them were written during a period of isolation after a period of travel.

 <h3>Final Philosophy I</h3> (posts between 2014/03/23 - 2014/8/3):
 - in retrospect, because I was trying to write while thinking fast, the writings lack vocabulary or use other words to encompass other meanings. I think much of the content is still good, if not better, because they are a closer reflection of my experiences -- in the duration of time between experience and thought (and writing), and in the distance between sensory experience and rationalizing.
 - from <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/an-attempt-to-write-everything-i-know">An Attempt to Write Everything I Know</a> and then on, I began writing some, blogging some, using and quoting my thoughts file to gain topics from very recent personal experiences, surprisingly similar to Montaigne. My thoughts file is endless, and it may be impossible to philosophize all of my experiences, but, for the time, I tried.

 <h2>thoughts about this post</h2>
 Update:
 Over time, this page has been quite useful in gauging importance and directing thought, so I organized it a little more, and added it to the top menu. It probably totally subverts the utility of Wordpress's organization, but it's all I've got as of now!
 
 [todo: should really clean this up, clean and finish all drafts, continue using my thoughts files to extract personal ideas and build on them.]
 
 Update:
 I ended up organizing nearly everything I've blogged! Hurray! It's not nearly as exhaustive as my thoughts.txt, but, the hope is, the things I wrote were things that I thought were, at least at the moment of blogging, important.
 
 This layout turns out to work really well. I can easily read old writings, remember what I was thinking of, and if I want, etch the thought out further. It also makes it easier to organize, for example, an earlier post titled the The Home Fallacy, clearly has ideas of autonomous ideals. It's also fun just to play around with it, like a book, skipping to chapters, getting ideas, and creating new paths.
 
 This has indeed slowly become my philosophical corpus.
 --
 
 Update:
 But let's hope I don't spend much time here.
 
 Hmm, can this organization further be automated, so that while I'm outside, using my phone to write thoughts directly here, I will never need to sit down and organize again? Wordpress's organization is indeed terrible. Over time, I've nearly created an outline of knowledge in the Wordpress's categories. It's useless. I guess the list of posts by date is all I've got. It sure sucks not being able to generate a list of posts, then edit it, say, adding *'s. I think it's okay to separate [writings by] periods of time, but perhaps I should avoid re-ordering them by categories.
 
 Yeah, <strong>forget the organization of words, stick to the organization of people (and material)!</strong>

No feeling for travel or people, or to be social. Now is a good time to self-assess.
 
 <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/a-self-assessment">Last time I assessed myself</a>, it was objective, written to be displayed to the public alongside my portfolio. It hides subjectivity and psychology, which I now want to explore.
 
 To explore this, I must recall the feelings I had during each point in time of my history, observe it, rationalize it.

 Virginia:
 School and media.
 
 During summer breaks in school, I didn't have work, so I'd spend a lot of time biking, exploring nearby neighborhoods.
 
 During the fall and especially winter, I'd barely be able to wake up, sleeping through the first one or two classes. I'd stay up playing video games late night in my Dad's office.
 
 In college, I'd continue sleeping in. I spent a lot of time watching great films and playing Super Smash Bros. with my friends.
 
 San Francisco:
 A new city. A drastic increase in interaction with the public on a daily basis. A life alone. So much time, despite the long working hours and commute. A great leap forward compared to the last 21 years of life.
 
 Yet it was a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat_race">rat race</a>. I worked for 8-10 hours and commuted for 4 hours. I was self-motivated by external factors: travel and survival. I took the job because I wanted to live in the city. Explore.
 
 I spent the weekends traveling at full-speed. Going to new neighborhoods, eating at Yelp-rated restaurants, attending art events, all scheduled ahead of time to maximize experience. It was superficial.
 
 It was fine for the moment, but I don't think I could do it again. It lasted less than 5 months.
 
 New York:
 Perhaps the rat race conditioned me to have a work-heavy (work-life balance) life in New York. I spent 80% of the time working on my own games in Pratt Institute's library. Working on something for 10+ hours a day, because I was self-motivated to do so. I thought, as long as I worked as hard as I did at a 9-5 toward work with a much higher standard than any job would I could get would allot; The time would be much more valuable, and therefore, in case I did need money, I would still be able to get a job -- a better one. It was my own work. My own ideas. Why not work hard at it?
 
 Turns out it was a failure because I failed to balance work-life. The designs were mediocre. Productive, somewhat innovative, poor execution. I failed to get verification for my work. I should have invested more time in social life.
 
 After the initial exploration day, I explored very little, interacted very little with people. I only attended game events and comedy nights (my friend and roommate was a comedian), especially those related to Babycastles. I volunteered at Babycastles and interned for Zack Lieberman. Otherwise, it mostly involved work and exercise (running outside at night). It was a very narrow lifestyle.
 
 Travel in Asia:
 An escape from the rat race, yet I was still racing.
 
 Taiwan:
 I travelled Taipei for nine days struggling to make a decision for work: teach, volunteer, what am I doing? I thought traveling was a waste of time, unproductive.
 
 I quickly found and volunteered at a school in Taiwan for two months. I assisted in teaching kids English by creating activities for younger students and having conversation with elder students. I also did general work: house chores, cooking, and babysitting. In retrospect, I feel a lot of it was still traveling: eating, learning Chinese, and fighting mosquitos.
 
 I then spent two weeks traveling around Taiwan, using CouchSurfing twice. It mostly involved talking to hostel workers, CouchSurfing hosts, traveling, and eating lots of Taiwanese food. I feel that the expiration of my visa kept me going. I flew to Singapore.
 
 Singapore:
 Left the terrible city immediately for Malaysia.
 
 Malaysia:
 I went to Kuala Lumpur and struggled. It's possible the heat drove me crazy. The goal was to make a film, but most of the time I wandered, ate, and failed to make film. I had footage of the worship of the three cultures of Malaysia: South India's Hinduism, Islam, and Chinese Bhuddism. There was a lot of time wasted looking for better hostels.
 
 I then went to Penang. I was fascinated by the traditional craftsmen there. I just love people who physically make things themselves as a living, and a traveller can physically see them all by walking along the streets. I began interviewing them, asking them questions. Then the film went on to cover the current gentrification of Penang and how the craftsmen would disappear. Then, while filming the craftsmen, I chose a delivery man, as the film would be more dynamic, and made a short film of just this single subject. I never bothered to complete the initial film. I also spent a week or so sick with gastroenteritis. The believe heat drove me nuts here too, driving me to see the craftsmen, old buildings, and try new foods.
 
 Thailand:
 In Bangkok I struggled again, as I did in Kuala Lumpur. Spending more time than I should have. I didn't even wander as much. I'd was trying to figure out my next direction. A gritty film about prostitution? Isn't that overly-exposed already? The heat drove me nuts yet again, leaving me in indecision. I finally decided to keep moving, north.
 
 I spent one day in Chiang Mai, and felt it was completely touristy. I decided to take trip through northwest Thailand via motorcycle. It was an odd experience. I mostly stuck to myself as I did in San Francisco the second time. I'd spend a few hours driving my motorcycle during the day, find a place to sleep, write some game ideas, and do some programming. There was an odd assortment of fascinating places: a town full of Yunnanese people who were part of the KMT and fled, mountain towns, dull transport towns, all full of kind and happy people. It was quick, one town per day, but it felt great. Motorcycle is the definitive way to travel, to consume the most, yet be an individual and make one's owns observations. There was little to no social interaction as I can't speak Thai.
 
 Laos:
 After I made the motorcycle loop, I still had two weeks to do something before I go to India. I decided to go to Laos. It was my "Into the Wild". I took a 48+ hour bus ride to the mountainous Phitsanoluk. I saw a market where tribal peoples from nearby villages barter wild game. I rented a second hand Chinese motorcycle and found mounds of trash. An odd mix of tribal peoples, recent goods lent from China (motorcycles, farm machinery, cell phones, TVs, power lines, packaged foods), and the beginning of giving technology to an undeveloped country. It contained lowest amount of intelligence I've encountered. The boat rides down river held the tone of Apocalypse Now, with tribal kids running around naked, parents picking up packages of cigarettes.
 
 India:
 I failed.
 
 I had planned to make games, but I just couldn't spend the time to do it. The warm weather drove me to go outside. Explore. I'd wander through nearby slums, hang out with my Uncle, experience the hugely contrasting social classes of India. The strict schedule of my relatives restricted my exploration. When they left, I began buying vegetables from the local market and cooking myself.
 
 A friend came with the intention to make a game using India as an inspiration. We ended up doing a game development workshop instead. It's more social.
 
 I finally decided to go through East Asia to empirically decide which city is best to live in.

 Taipei:
 When I was in Taipei for three months to study Mandarin, I experienced the Apex of my Schizoid Personality Disorder.
 
 Was it <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_alienation#Self-estrangement">self-estrangement</a>? Self-estrangement can be defined as “the psychological state of denying one’s own interests – of seeking out extrinsically satisfying, rather than intrinsically satisfying, activities...”.[32] It could be characterized as a feeling of having become a stranger to oneself, or to some parts of oneself, or alternatively as a problem of self-knowledge, or authenticity.

 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypomania
 
 The brain includes several distinct dopamine systems, one of which plays a major role in reward-motivated behavior.
 
 Abnormally high dopaminergic transmission has been linked to psychosis and schizophrenia.
 
 Studies with sensory deprivation have shown that the brain is dependent on signals from the outer world to function properly. If the spontaneous activity in the brain is not counterbalanced with information from the senses, loss from reality and psychosis may occur after some hours. A similar phenomenon is paranoia in the elderly, when poor eyesight, hearing and memory make the person abnormally suspicious of the environment.
 On the other hand, loss from reality may also occur if the spontaneous cortical activity is increased so that it is no longer counterbalanced with information from the senses. The 5-HT2A receptor seems to be important for this, since psychedelic drugs that activate them produce hallucinations.
 
 the acute effects of dopamine stimulants include euphoria, alertness and over-confidence
 
 the main feature of psychosis is not hallucinations, but the inability to distinguish between internal and external stimuli.
 
 Psychosis has been traditionally linked to the neurotransmitter dopamine. In particular, the dopamine hypothesis of psychosis has been influential and states that psychosis results from an overactivity of dopamine function in the brain, particularly in the mesolimbic pathway. The two major sources of evidence given to support this theory are that dopamine receptor D2 blocking drugs (i.e., antipsychotics) tend to reduce the intensity of psychotic symptoms, and that drugs that boost dopamine activity (such as amphetamines and cocaine) can trigger psychosis in some people (see amphetamine psychosis).[67] However, increasing evidence in recent times has pointed to a possible dysfunction of the excitory neurotransmitter glutamate, in particular, with the activity of the NMDA receptor.

 A surprisingly great factor in my life.
 
 I theorize there's an association to weather and dopamine. I feel sunlight and heat release more dopamine, exaggerating the input of external stimuli. Without sunlight and heat, external stimuli is blunted.
 
 TODO: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seasonal_affective_disorder">Seasonal Affective Disorder</a>, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_disorder
 
 In Guns, Germs, and Steel, one of the probable answers by scientists for why people in Papua New Guinea did not have "cargo" (technology) is "the inhibitory effects of tropical climate (heat and humidity), and on human creativity and energy." I was unable to Google much about this, but looking at the locations of Global cities, it's possible.
 
 I will divide my experience according to temperature and amount of sunlight: "<strong>summer</strong>" (high heat, high amount of sunlight), "<strong>winter</strong>" (low heat, low amount of heat), and "<strong>normal</strong>" (temperate heat and sunlight). Quotes are used because the season doesn't matter, the actual temperature and sunlight do. In addition, I've moved several times in my life into different climates.
 
 <h2>Summer</h2>
 I am more inclined to go outside, stay in the sun, socialize, and am generally happier.
 
 I want to stay out, on the streets, consuming more information externally by traveling -- learning languages, thinking about others lives, anthropology, developing a care for those that struggle (like Tsai-Ming Liang films), seeing the world from the streets, wondering what people do indoors and why anyone would spend time inside. I am actively thinking at all times. Thinking about what to do at every moment, talking to myself (possibly in another language!). In extreme cases, I don't want to spend any time indoors or alone. I become completely extroverted.
 
 I feel more creative. I spend more time thinking about people. I want everything I do to involve a social aspect: art, school, work, and recreation. I wouldn't mind taking a job as long as I am outside and social: a postman, a waiter at an outdoor cafe. My art gravitates toward ones that involve my interaction with other people: Humans of New York and Vincent Moon are of inspiration, as it involves with me simultaneously living and producing.
 
 This coincides my love for games, which is also socially interactive. The problem comes when the game is digital, in which the implementation, programming, is not interactive. At most, one can be in a social place (the common room of a hostel, a public park, a social cafe, at a friend's house, a studio) and do the work alongside others, with little interaction. It is a continuation of striving to find ways to live and work simultaneously.
 
 The con of summer time is that I do less work, or don't want to do any work at all. Or, perhaps, I do not do work that is not social -- programming.
 
 Physically, I drink more water, exercise less, do not suffer from carb-insulin problems, and may happily take a nap after some intense heat.

 <h2>Winter</h2>
 <blockquote>
 Buy underclothing to control body warmth.
 ...
 Taking a shower could be a good way to get warm, if exercise does not work.
 ...
 The weather makes a large difference. I need to either live in an area with warm climate or wear underclothing all of the time.
 ...
 The cold weather affects me too. Feel like eating and doing mindless work instead of designing.
 <cite>~2/14/13 to 8/6/13 in San Francisco the second time</cite>
 </blockquote>
 
 I ignore the world. Traveling and socializing becomes less rewarding. I'd rather stay indoors, only talking to people for a specific purpose. I'm more likely to consume media -- films substitute observation, games substitute interaction). I'm more passive. I can do lonely tasks for a long period of time -- programming, writing, etc. I don't require social feedback. I become introverted.
 
 In San Francisco, the second time, I was able to spend 80% of my time alone in UCSF library, in my room, or in cafes, programming. In New York, I was able to spend 80% of my time in Pratt Institute's library, programming. During both times, the weather was mild to cold.
 
 Physically, I suffer from the winter blues

 During my first job, I self-diagnosed myself to have <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delayed_sleep_phase_syndrome">Delayed Sleep Phase Syndrome</a>. The wikipedia article described several problems of my life during school. In retrospect, I now know this is only one comorbidity of a larger problem.
 
 There is a clear division of the times I wake up: <strong>delayed</strong>, <strong>inconsistent</strong>, and <strong>on time</strong>.
 
 <h2>Delayed</h2>
 This occurs when I am intrinsically motivated, without external factors affecting me, or during which I have no reactions to external stimuli.
 
 It seems if I have a normal social life or daily schedule -- a job, personal work, school, I can stick to it, somewhat. I just happen to wake up a little later, perhaps 10:30AM. I'd sleep well, wake up spontaneously, feeling refreshed. I adapted my life to fit my body's schedule, resulting in a less social, yet extremely physiologically healthy life. It probably netted in more films then real social activities.
 
 During scheduled work -- school and my first two jobs, I'd choose to come in at 10:30AM to 11:00AM, which is about when my brain wakes up. I'd start out well, but as my motivation waned I came in later. Perhaps I became less excited about life outside of work -- exploring the city, social connections. Or, more likely, my jobs were repetitive, and I failed to find ways to continue being creative in such limits. Eight hours without creativity should make anyone somewhat intelligent mental.
 
 In SF the second time and NY, when I was working on my own things, or things of mutual motivation, I woke up on a delayed schedule. During the summer, I'd often wake up at 10:30AM, but come winter time It would be a lot more inconsistent.
 
 <h2>Inconsistent</h2>
 This occurs during winter depressions, or as previously mentioned, when motivation in work -- school and work -- dwindles.
 
 During winter depression, and even worse, the combination of winter and school or work, the schedule is severely impaired, resulting in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-24-hour_sleep%E2%80%93wake_disorder">Non-24-hour sleep–wake disorder</a>. I'd wake up anywhere between 10:30AM to 4PM, sleeping at inconsistent times, unable to wake up at desired times, advancing my sleeping schedule forward, until I have to reset it.
 
 <h2>On time</h2> (business hours)<strong>:</strong>
 Being on time requires my goals to be attached to some external factor.
 
 During the summers of my childhood, I wake up early because I'd want to go out, to enjoy the sun, to have more time to play with my friends, to have more time to explore with my bike. Also during family trips, I'd wake up alongside my family.
 
 During most of my travel in Asia, I woke up on time. Perhaps this is because most people slept or went home when the sun went down. Or, because I was consistently motivated. <em>Travel is special time where intrinsic motivation is affected by external stimuli.</em>
 
 In an extreme case, in Laos, where there was no light or electricity available, I woke up at 5am. Was it because there was no light, I had nothing to do (no computer, no one to talk to, no light to write), or I wanted to wake up with people the next day? Probably a combination of the three.
 
 In another case, I'd wake early if my current goal or objective involved the interaction of other people whom have normal circadian rhythms:
 
 In hostels, I'd often sleep with others, and, I'd wake up at the same time as they did. The action of people getting up in my room served as a time device. It was quite motivating (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_loafing">Social Loafing</a>?), and socially healthy. I loved talking to others while getting ready. Similarly, many families in India live in a single room, waking up together at 5AM. Another reason maybe because I am schizoid and normally don't have anyone to talk to in the morning.
 
 During Humans of Taipei, my main goal was to talk to people, so I'd wake up early to maximize work time. At that point, I was so focused on other people I felt there was no reason to be awake at night as there was nothing for me to do that would advance me toward my goal. I'd sleep happily with the sounds of neighbors and people on the streets from a nearby open window.
 
 --
 Being schizoid, it's possible for me to live without any external factors, leading to a misaligned sleep schedule. Intrinsic motivation and a delayed sleep schedule has had the most prolonged routine sleep schedules. The times I was <em>on time</em> were all very temporary. Being inconsistent usually means I was depressed. 1812 2014-03-23 17:01:00 2014-03-23 21:01:00 open closed sleeping-problems publish 0 0 post 0 Life Personal Psychology Schizoid Personality Disorder _edit_last 1 _yoast_wpseo_primary_category medium_post O:11:"Medium_Post":11:{s:16:"author_image_url";s:74:"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/200/200/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png";s:10:"author_url";s:28:"https://medium.com/@rahil627";s:11:"byline_name";N;s:12:"byline_email";N;s:10:"cross_link";s:2:"no";s:2:"id";s:12:"77b353d3980f";s:21:"follower_notification";s:3:"yes";s:7:"license";s:19:"all-rights-reserved";s:14:"publication_id";s:2:"-1";s:6:"status";s:6:"public";s:3:"url";s:59:"https://medium.com/@rahil627/sleeping-problems-77b353d3980f";} A Foreigner Crashes at the Legislative Yuan's Slumber Party http://rahilpatel.com/blog/a-foreigner-crashes-at-the-legislative-yuans-slumber-party Wed, 02 Apr 2014 20:38:46 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=1857 <h2>Precursor</h2>
 I, the writer, am a foreigner, and I naively write this article from the perspective of one, with a focus on observation and empiricism as opposed to research.
 
 <h2>Summary</h2>
 Sleeping at the Legislative Yuan (立法院) for two nights one can come to understand that Taiwan's autonomous and selfless culture would lead to an entirely technocratic society, if only it weren't strangled by the fear of China.
 
 <h2>Current Status</h2>
 Taiwanese students (and politically unaffiliated academia and NGOs) continue to protest from within the Legislative Yuan and its perimeter, boycotting the expedited review process of the Cross-Strait Service Trade Agreement (CSSTA). The uprising is natural and timely, in March, the time of election and past protests. For the past few years Taiwan's government has been snowballing down leading to an increased connectivity with China, a decrease in President Ma's (馬英九) rating, and increased anxiety of the uncertainty of the future of Taiwan.
 
 <h2>Protest Experience</h2>
 Before I jump into my experience, I think it's important to note that the current protest isn't a completely new phenomenon. From the Wild Lilly movement, to the Wild Strawberry movement, to 2010 under the table deals with China to the forming of the Black Island Youth Alliance, school associations from top universities have teamed with human rights NGOs to mediate the law. They are the seeds of technocracy. Now trained for non-violent protests, they await any wrongful move by the government to pounce on.
 
 <h2>The Autonomy of Taiwan</h2>
 One can only understand this by being born in another country and traveling to Taiwan or sleeping at the Legislative Yuan (LY). I arrived on March 30, after the President's Office rally.
 
 Already, in a matter of days the LY's main podium has now come to include: An information department capable of handling anything including the coordination of student unions inside, outside, and around Taiwan; A goods department which includes 8 tents that provide food, water, raincoats, blankets, other supplies, outside, and one department inside, located near the back door where on the other side a tent resides, all of which are itemized and operated without money; A translation department where news is reported via <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sunflowermovement">social media</a> and replied as requested by foreign reporters; A recycling center; A medical department which includes modern medicine, traditional Chinese medicine, and a person at the main hall's door who checks temperature by pointing a gun at your forehead, rewarding you with hand sanitizer, set near the front door in case people need to be taken in or out.
 
 Built like a well-planned fort, more convenient than a Taiwanese 7-11, the students have created self-sustainable town equipped with its own service sector inside the the heart of government, a mirror of it's economy, now 73% service-oriented, and its past form of government: martial law.
 
 Such autonomy begs two questions. Does Taiwan need more help? No. They've fared extremely well with their current relations and export / import rates. Of course, more entrepreneurship opportunities would be nice. Does Taiwan <em>want</em> more help? Only if they can retain their status quo.
 
 <h2>A Microcosm of Taiwan's Society</h2>
 Riot police restrict certain areas. The police wait at the parliament's entrances. A line of ten Taiwanese TV and radio companies waiting for the next speech by student leaders, 70% of which may be considered pro-KMT. Despite the seriousness of it all, the culture of Taiwan, the "strawberry generation", causes me, a foreigner, to view it a very unusual and seemingly unserious ordeal that highlights the characteristics of Taiwan's society: polite, passive, uncompetitive, competent, social, open, and caring.
 
 Outside, students sleep on aluminum blankets, cardboard boxes, and connectable styrofoam puzzle pieces. They eat baozi (包子) and biandang (便當), read books, follow social media, as if it were a college courtyard. Cute handicrafts, sunflowers, and cardboard signs pervade the public walls. Films are played on projectors. Music performances are staged. A 7-11 on the block remains open and crowded. A line of riot police face a line of sunflower-holding students. Government buildings have been cutely reupholstered. Inside the artfully-draped LY their culture concentrates.
 
 The entrance guarded by police without weapons; The only difference between a policeman and a security guard is their uniform. One's ability to enter relies entirely on perceived disposition of the current guard, foreigner or not, an expression of indisrimination. The front door to the hall is blocked by a Katamari Damacy ball of lay-z-boys and other excess furniture. An extra line of security guards sit and play popular smartphone games -- Candy Crush and Clash of Titans -- during the day and nap in the same seat during the night.
 
 The main lobby and courtyard are usually empty, holding an occasional interview.
 
 On the first floor there's a break room with movie theater style seating and a tiny TV playing the news. People discuss democracy and relax, probably similar to the legislatures that normally lounge there.
 
 Upstairs, climbing a ladder over a barricade, the second floor contains: bathrooms with shower supplies, more conference rooms, which is where the most important people meet and make decisions, and entrances to the balcony of the main hall.
 
 The main hall, split into a few sections: the podium full of aforementioned departments, the floor where students and professors sit in circles and discuss sociology and politics, a row of new reporter cameras, and the tables and empty space behind where students live, is a dream.
 
 Handicraft art decorates the walls: handwritten letters and signs. More Katamari Damacy balls of excess things. Cardboard signs were created for each department. More junk is used to make a dinosaur overnight. White tape outlines on the floor depicting places where students sat. A ventilation duct hangs from the second floor window like a giant playground slide.
 
 Taiwanese people are masters of DIY culture. Give them reason and they will competently accomplish any given task, monetarily efficient and with cultural flair.
 
 Tables are littered with packaged food and drinks on the tables, magically cleaned every day just as night markets are. The floor filled with students sleeping at any moment of time, playing smartphone games, using social media to talk to friends, taking occasional selfies. Students sit where legislatures normally do. The most formally dressed person I spotted: a female reporter wearing a suit with a mini skirt and converse sneakers.
 
 People hang out, socialize, sleep, shower, eat, study, and work. The LY is now a workplace and a home. The LY is now the smallest town in Taiwan.
 
 
 <h2>Two Nights at the Legislative Yuan</h2>
 Night 1, March 30:
 During the Presidential Office rally on March 30, 500,000+ people marched the 10-lane Ketagalan Boulevard with such pleasant conduct that lanes has separate uses: for sitting, walking forward, walking backward, and emergency vehicles. The flow of the march was so smooth that it took a mere fifteen minutes to walk from the President's office to the Legislative Yuan. The atmosphere akin to a rather corporate music festival, as expected with such a large crowd. As one arrives to the original protest site, energy increases while still retaining harmony, with art, posters, tents, speakerphones, discussions, music, and film.
 
 It's amazing to see such a diverse crowd, people from all parts of society, act in unison. In comparison, at Occupy Wall St., one can expect schizophrenic beggars dishing out non-sense alongside debt-filled students having heated discussions with big businessmen. It's clear if something wrong happens, the public will react with great solidarity.
 
 Night 2, March 31:
 Bai Lang (白狼) said in a press conference that he and 2000 of his men would come to the Legislative Yuan at 3AM. At 3AM, the students remain unchanged, half asleep. When I asked a NTU student why [students are not stressed], he said, many don't know, and the others think it's highly unlikely that anything awful would happen.
 
 I saw fear in the faces of students, not of Bai Lang, but of the government, but they continued with uncertainty with the prevalent reply of, "I don't know what to do". An example: my friend, a half-mainlander, encountered a college student who was furious at his existence, but the most she could do was make a half-angry face for a few seconds with an urge to tell other people. Several people I've talked to over my past few months in Taiwan also exhibit this helpless attitude, not just for politics, but of anything. Further reinforcement that Taiwanese people are non-violent and selfless, or, in the way my friend puts it, "lacking testosterone".
 
 <h2>Now and Later</h2>
 The movement has been, for the most part, and comparatively to other concurrent uprisings, peaceful, perhaps even seen as "weak", and possibly therefore overshadowed globally by other news. Yet, it's clear that under Ma's presidency, China has been slowly ingesting Taiwan, a country with the 19th largest economy, equal to Australia, and double that of Hong Kong.
 
 The students still only ask for one thing, a review of the bill. That's powerful, as many other protests take on broader ideologies and become criticized because its lack of precise objectives (Occupy Wall St.).
 
 As of now, it's a passive stalemate.
 
 If Ma gives the bill a rightful review, would everything resume as normal? Or at this point, does Ma even matter? Can Taiwan's inherently non-violent passive society take further action and further pressure the KMT?
 
 Or will the fear from past government actions (White Terror, Executive Yuan incident) and China in general (1600 missiles aimed at Taiwan) prevent the students from taking further action?
 
 The moment is pivotal.
 
 With an autonomous society lacking political testosterone, one would hope Taiwan will continue in a technocratic way without political affiliations, in the hands of its newly founded elite: the students (academia), begin another Taiwan Miracle, and become a country founded on intelligence, a seemingly perfect government. Unfortunately, a relationship with China continually flaws it.
 
 As for me, a foreigner, there seems to be only two things to do: inform foreign media, and criticize or dominate the core decision-making group to incite action, with very very poor spoken Chinese skill.

 I take a break from programming for a contract. Rote work. It's too late to be around people to figure out a way to make this rote task playful, fun, meaningful (learning something, social). Or, recently, I've become less playful. As I procrastinate my work, I begin to wonder why.
 
 Let's ignore my biological problems of low dopamine, ADHD, SPD, etc.
 
 People [should] gravitate toward knowledge.
 
 How did I gather knowledge? Not passively, that's for sure. I've [interactively] explored my neighborhood as kid, watched several films, explored big American cities, and a good portion of Asia. I've worked a few jobs to get enough money, but only to get enough, to afford further exploration, further knowledge.
 
 Why has travel been so effective? What is travel? The latter's common answer is that travel is about culture -- language, customs, history, genetic differences that lead to a unique social construct. Another answer is meeting people. But isn't the only difference between people of different countries culture? Why not travel one's own country?. The novelty, the differences of my own culture, or more appropriately, the culture I grew around, is interesting, triggering dopamine, just as any new piece of art is. The observation of differences is appealing. But that's temporary. Novelty fades. The dopamine settles.
 
 What was gained from this experience? Could it have been gained in another way? Say, passively, through a book? Would it have been faster (and cheaper!) to learn through a book? How much is learned passively?
 
 I feel that the meaning of travel, or to a more extreme degree, nomadism, isn't just the absorption of another culture, but including, the avoidance of having one's own culture. When one ignores the social constructs of one's own society, one begins to observe further how people create societies, and when one ignores societies altogether (technology, capitalism, etc.), one begins to enter philosophies, in which lies an expanse of knowledge to explore.
 
 One begins to question meaning of language, methods to maximize life, the meaning of life, the development of cities, the anthropology of mountainous peoples, interactive public art, the future of Taiwan, ubiquitous computing, and so on, because it's easier to see once one doesn't live in a social construct. The ability to see this, learn this, is possible without reading the work of Wittgenstein, Alan Turing, and Freud. Furthermore, without reading Tolstoy, Joyce, Dostoevsky, and Kafka; That is, without old and passive medium of books, and perhaps, an old method of learning.
 
 The result: an uneven liberal arts education. So, I guess that answers part of one question, empiricism is, in addition to uneven, inefficient.
 
 But there is a positive notion this lifestyle. It's original. The sources in which these things were learned are completely original, therefore, hopefully, leading to more creative output.
 
 Also, it's fun. I was actively participating along the way. Both of which is required for my personality.
 
 Surely there must be a way to make learning completely efficient, fun, social, thoroughly active, and productive.
 
 Why aren't there any good schools? Good determined by the aforementioned factors.
 
 The internet exists. Why aren't great classes taught by great professors pervading every classroom. In some good college, someone is teaching in a brilliantly fun way, perhaps teachings the physics through a game that uses physics. But would even that be enough?
 
 Humans do seek a social aspect to life, which leads people to cling together into institutions. It creates relationships, which likely leads to work. Is it simply certain interaction between certain people that leads to learning? What is this magic formula [THINK ABOUT THIS MORE]?
 
 But people aren't necessary. I think relationships just happens to lead to a more stable life. Artists and philosophers trap themselves in log cabins, or other parts of the world, to create something, which probably involves learning too.
 
 There is much to learn through media, travel, and people (not just smarts ones). Many smart folks are able to inhale books and learn everything from it instantly. Thinking about this, now it seems the need of having fun, to be creative, is a learning disability.
 
 To be efficient, one must be alone. What one knows and and wants to know is unique. No class perfectly cover the domain of knowledge one desires, and because there is more than one person, it will always possess repetition of known things.
 
 An ideal answer: everyone should have a human professor to teach them exactly what they don't know in a fun way. A real answer: everyone should use online courses fit precisely for what they don't know. That's progress. Now the only thing missing is a social aspect. The active part.
 
 I see three ways for early learning:
 
 To take an online course, and give the burden of creativity to the learner, allowing them to create an activity for themselves to reinforce the knowledge immediately, whilst maintaining the fundamental human needs. It would require much willpower to balance this life, but perhaps, the most efficient if done right.
 
 Or did artists always have it right? Wander around until one finds something they like, explore it deeply, and create something from it? Learning, reinforcing, and creating, and repeating this. The most productive life. Isn't life about productivity anyway? Even at an early age, one can delve deeply. It just would leave the person to stray from the social norms and possibly lead to life problems.
 
 Playful people strive to make life continually playful, keeping within modern social constructs, diverging slightly for the benefit of learning, yet maintaining relationships. It seems to be the most balanced method, but perhaps not straying far enough to explore something deeply enough to create something great enough to further humans or art.
 
 I don't know. I'm tired. And I've got a lot of work to do, which, unfortunately, will not teach me anything new. Certainly, a failure on my part, for not choosing a job that would allow me to learn (or create) more.

 Programming can be fun with a studio of really good friends, but even then, it's likely a studio full of more programmers whom share the same culture -- professional, media consuming, internet-heavy, Pitchfork indie music listening, people. They're not nearly as diverse, interesting, or inspiring as travel.
 
 This has been my bane during my travels. Trying to balance the two. But why have I held onto programming? Why not do something more direct with the people. Am I, at the end, a lone artist? Do I value myself over any other kind of work? Yeah, I think so.
 
 During the time of Humans of Taipei was at the apex of happiness. I loved every moment. That's something to remember.
 
 Very recently I've entered a depression, not unlike my past winter depressions. I'm unable to wake up, I oversleep, I'm not seeking social moments, I'm not seeking or doing anything really, except writing and programming, alone.
 
 What happened? Why did I suddenly give up on the maintenance of my social connections? Why did I fail to continue consuming? Looking at the precise moment, it was a time where I was cleaning my room, starting a programming gig, both solitary activities. It was also getting a little cold too. It also saw more time in my apartment, as opposed to being outside, trying to consume objects (media) instead of life.
 
 Yeahp. The social aspect is missing. And without it, I go into depression. Well, now I do. Before traveling, I was fine without much of a social life, using media to replace life. Now, media isn't enough. I need to be with people at all times.
 
 Fuck you, programming. Fuck you, apartment. Both burdens have so much weight. Perhaps being a teacher is best. 1908 2014-04-23 15:43:30 2014-04-23 19:43:30 open closed lone-work-and-depression publish 0 0 post 0 Personal _edit_last 1 _wp_old_slug lone-art-and-depression Taiwan and Japan: Active and Passive Lifestyles http://rahilpatel.com/blog/taiwan-and-japan-active-and-passive-lifestyles Fri, 02 May 2014 21:57:26 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=1919 I had to leave Taiwan to renew my visa, so I came to Okinawa, and one day in, I am reminded not just why I dislike the country, but also why I love Taiwan. The difference between the two countries is that the lifestyles -- the way people act in their environment -- are the opposite. Taiwanese people live an active lifestyle; Japanese people live a passive lifestyle (Okinawa may not be a good test sample, but my time in Osaka and Tokyo mirror this). 
 
 I'm going to step back into the time before I left America.
 
 At that time, I thought Japan would be a really interesting experience. In my perspective, Japan has polite 'n' quirky people, it's the most developed of the East Asian countries, and of course, it probably has the most alien culture of developed countries. I wasn't attracted to the things otakus are; I wanted to see people being as silly as they are in those whacky game shows, who often are shy but react in hilarious ways. Those playful people. 
 
 Before leaving, I thought Japan would be the apex of my trip in Asia. I started in Taiwan and I loved it. Then I decided to go through South East Asia, saving Japan for another trip.
 
 When the time came I checked WikiTravel and planned silly fun things to do: see arcades, sleep at a capsule hotel, sleep at a manga cafe, see fashion trends in harajuku, eat at the fish market, see modern art, talk to people at modern art places, attend a game convention, etc. And although some of those things were fun, the people and environment were not. The fun ended quickly as I was unable to create many social experiences during my travels with people outside of my hostel.
 
 In contrast to my expectations, Japan did not have anything I desired. It was the rest of Asia that I had experienced that did.
 
 Japan's culture is uninteresting to me because people passively consume media. Furthermore, the media they consume is narrow, and over time it becomes more narrow, to the point it becomes alien to the world. The otaku culture that I was not interested in made more sense once I saw Japan. Kids and adults alike over-consume manga, anime, computer medias, pop music, and whatever else. So much time is spent consuming that they don't move. They spend most of their time indoors, reading, playing single player repetitive games, perhaps talking to someone next to them who is doing the same thing.
 
 I wouldn't want to live in a country where the most social interaction is reading next to another person. I want to actually interact with the other person, or at least consume reality -- travel, food, talking.
 
 Everything in Japan takes place either indoors or at machines. Shopping for groceries, buying snacks, ordering at a restaurant, transportation, before work, working, after-work, having fun, all the time. There's nothing to see on the outside. There is no street culture. The most one can witness is the mass of people commuting to and from work in Tokyo's busy areas.
 
 There's not enough <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/creativity-external-stimuli-cities-and-suburbs" title="Creativity, External Stimuli, Cities, and Suburbs">external stimuli</a> for me. And if I can't socialize with the people, then there's no other hope to fulfill my need for it. There's nothing to see or talk to. And I don't enjoy passively consuming, even in the company of others.
 
 Taiwanese people, in contrast live a highly active lifestyle. They're talking all of the time. With their friends next to them or through LINE, to the public (food and drink vendors [not machines!], service industry). Far less spend time is spent playing dull games or consuming dull media in the company of others. Perhaps they will play in a subway, but that is because none of their relations are physically around them.
 
 They even consume a more diverse media. They watch American, Taiwanese, Japanese, Korean, Hong Kong, and Chinese media. All somehow dubbed to Mandarin for the masses. Their English is better. They're curious of other cultures. They want to talk to other people, which is the main motivation to learn a language. In Japan, the people seem to simply not be interested in other cultures, which probably explains their low English rate. A cram school won't help if one isn't actually interested in talking to people who speak the language, or another culture's media.
 
 Even their [Taiwan] environment is highly active. They retain the social street culture similar to poorer countries, which provides as much or even more external stimulus than a developed big city such as New York. Scooters zoom by, day markets flourish with fresh vegetables during the day, night market brings tons of people out to shop, or just to look and walk, or to a nearby mountain or park for a quick meal. Most traditional restaurants are open-air. The senses are blasted with hordes of market strollers and wafts of stinky tofu.
 
 It is this broad-consumption of daily life that allows one to live a more social, happy, creative (socially creative at least [as opposed to creating media]), and active life.
 
 An active life, that is, one is constantly making decisions before taking action. One thinks to call a friend, cook something, go to a park, embark an adventure, not because they were told to, but because one decided themselves to do so.
 
 The narrow passive consumption of Japan is more akin to the suburbs. One consumes the media around them or computer (although the computer is a more interactive form of consumption). The only new stimuli is media (if they chose a new one) and the social experience with people of whom they already have a relationship with (if they even created new relationships outside the ones they were born into i.e. their family).
 
 I would stereotype the two countries' societies as so: Taiwan is the social island nation where the people are always friendly and happy; Japan is the dsytopian future where media and machines replaced human interaction.
 
 I like technology, but only if it has a social aspect.

 Okinawa reminds me of my hometown, Virginia Beach. Any suburb reminds me of Virginia Beach.
 
 Virginia Beach served me well when I was young, had a bike, and neighborhood friends, but I outlived the area quickly, and then I turned toward media, becoming a more lonely person.
 
 Here, in Okinawa, I find myself in the same position. I've been here for a day and feel there is nothing to do.
 
 Why?
 
 Why did big American cities and less developed Asia offer months of exploration, and why does Okinawa, or any suburb, have nothing to offer?
 
 Clearly this is subjective, perception.
 
 But then again, why do artists live in cities? Is it just the creative jobs, other artists, like-minded people?
 
 I think beyond those reasons external stimuli is at play.
 
 Big cities have tons of events; Less developed Asia has street culture. Both easily accessible by the public. In a single day one simply experiences more because there is more to see and do. On the subway in New York, perhaps a street musician comes in, tons of diverse people are abound doing something. One could attend a new event every day. In less developed Asian countries, street vendors chat away, day and night markets attract all kinds of people for a stroll, everyday life can be seen from the street. One witnesses the life of others everyday, and the heat lures people (or just me) to do more adventurous things.
 
 Creativity, I imagine, is usually seen as an introversive process. One thinks of something new. But the process for me is based on experience, the distractions of the environment I live in. External stimuli is key.
 
 The experiences (events, adventures) inspires me to create more adventures or challenges or work. Experiences inspire the creation of more experiences.
 
 Back to the question. Why do I fail to have new experiences in the suburbs?
 
 Well, what experiences do suburban people have? Consume media (alone and together). Potluck dinners. Family gatherings. Work (can be social).
 
 I consider anything social as creative. Why didn't the social gatherings feel like significant experiences? I can't remember having many adventures in the suburbs.
 
 Perhaps they [the social gatherings] just weren't enough, and I need more. A social gathering in a house is one experience, but there's more that can be experienced between. The commutes in cars are horrendously inefficient and dull. In Virginia Beach, one gets into their car, takes the same street to get to their destination. If the street is a highway, the most one can experience is a car accident or a funny license plate. In Tapei, a normal commute from my apartment often consists of: walking through an old neighborhood where people are doing laundry and washing dishes outside, a day market with fresh fruits and vegetables, pet stores with cute pets at the window and people interacting with them, on to a bicycle, through streets and alleys (with the ability to take new routes), dismount the bicycle, and walk to the destination.
 
 Perhaps in addition to the lack of external stimuli, my personality is at fault. In the suburbs, life is almost entirely based on the experiences they have with the relationships they currently have. Furthermore, if one is Asian, then the relationships are likely not far from the family. It's healthy. Normal. I think. But I consider myself to have SPD [todo: link]. I love meeting people (probably for the experience) but have trouble maintaining relationships, eventually avoiding people altogether, forgetting how to talk. In a suburb, I turn to media for new experiences and continue to be lonely. In big cities and less developed Asian countries, during times I am less social or depressed, I am still able to have new experiences, and do not feel alone. I have the city. I have all the people outside.
 
 I sit down at a food stall near my apartment after midnight. A Taiwanese couple in their forties offer me to sit with them. We introduce ourselves, talk a little, and eat. My heart is uplifted by the sympathy of this couple. I call a friend. I recover. I live on.
 
 Such a situation would be harder to come by in the suburbs.
 
 <blockquote>
 It's because that's the only stimulus she has in the house. There is no one for her to talk to, no stimuli to respond to, and subsequently no creativity to make up for the lack of it.
 <cite>10/6/14</cite>
 </blockquote>
 
 If there are almost no new stimuli, it's possible for one to enter a completely routine life.
 
 Perhaps this intensifies causation.
 
 <blockquote>
 Moving from the lively hostel I. [?] Seoul to the slow paced hostel in Busan, I remember how difficult it is to keep the pace of life I like -- the city pace.
 <cite>9/3/13 in Busan, South Korea</cite>
 </blockquote>
 
 A feeling one always gets moving from city to suburb. Impulsivity (pace) changes.
 
 
 
 <blockquote>It feels like the first time I’m eating alone. I hate eating without a day's work.
 <cite>[same as above date?]</cite>
 </blockquote>
 
 Cities provide a feeling of being together, even if one personally is not.
 
 
 
 <blockquote>9/13/13
 Busan relaxed me. I began working on a game that, during many points in my travel, I did not feel had a great design. So, the suburbs are a good place to work, but its easy to work on something fruitless Its a waste of time. So is learning languages without practical use. Yeah, I'd rather live in a roller coaster pace, having moments of high design so that I don't fall into the comfort of working on something without design.
 <cite>9/3/13 in Busan, South Korea</cite>
 </blockquote>
 
 I felt there was nothing to do in the suburban town that I began making stuff, though, I simultaneously felt that it was a waste of time. It is an absurdity. Creating media does not directly affect people, so the reward is not offered until the product is complete and distributed. The feedback loop is too large to sustain constant motivation. I am too impatient.
 
 Cities are more likely to make one more political. Take actions to directly affect people.

 It's quite clear to see in my life that there are two phases: hypomania and overly rational.
 
 One, is the frequently mentioned <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/hypomania" title="Hypomania">hypomanic</a> stage, which is highly emotional, instinctive, fast, consuming lots, intense eternal stimuli.
 
 In this phase real life is satisfying enough. External stimuli more than satisfies my emotions, causing hypomania.
 
 The second is slow, little to no emotion, <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/lateral-thinking-external-stimuli-and-self-control">external stimuli has been conditioned and adapted to</a>, loss in relationships, loss in a creative life (creative not in terms of work, but in terms of thoughts and designs), being able to focus on very narrow things like programming, work, mediums that require much design thinking.
 
 This in phase I watch a few films per week to satisfy my thirst for emotional content.

This post's content is similar to a past general empirical post, <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/the-life-of-a-nomadic-schizoid" title="The Life of a Nomadic Schizoid">The Life of a Nomadic Schizoid</a>, but focuses on the creative process.
 
 Of the theories found on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creativity#Theories_of_creative_processes">Wikipedia article for creativity</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creativity#Honing_theory">Honing Theory</a> seems to be most modern, complex, and the one that best fits to my creative process during my travels.
 
 Let's walk through a single phase of hypomania and creativity.
 
 <blockquote>Honing theory posits that creativity arises due to the self-organizing, self-mending nature of a worldview ...
 <cite>Wikipedia, <a href="http://<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creativity#Honing_theory">Creativity, Honing Theory</a></cite>
 </blockquote>
 
 When I travel to a new place, especially from a place with low external stimuli (Japan, suburbs) to a place with high external stimuli (Taiwan, cities) I often go through a hypomanic episode. During this time, everything externally visible is intense, aching inquiry -- people, language, culture, objects, all of the humanities are at question. My mind has to re-organize everything. I use all of my free time exploring manically, until, eventually becoming familiar with the setting, and stop inquiring.
 
 <blockquote>... and that it is by way of the creative process the individual hones (and re-hones) an integrated worldview.
 </blockquote>
 
 During this time my values are volatile; It depends entirely on what I consumed recently, and the intensity of it. Perhaps I focus on the poorest of people with intense emotional attachment (artisans in Malaysia [<a href="https://vimeo.com/55547982">Roti Delivery</a>], slums and servants in India, prostitutes in Southeast Asia, tribal peoples in Laos, Tsai Ming Liang, Kim Ki Duk), wanting to do something with them, despising any higher class. Perhaps I'm deeply curious about what other people are thinking; How or why they do the things that they do -- culture and sociology (in addition to the poor peoples, the public of Taipei [<a href="https://www.facebook.com/TaiwanesePeople">Humans of Taipei</a>], Humans of New York, Vincent Moon). Perhaps I'm confident, competitive, with extreme high art ideas, and do not wish to lower my standards, like (no particular subject is of inspiration, it's just crazy associations of previous knowledge [<a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/pinkies-up" title="Pinkies Up">Pokemon Snap</a>, <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/playground-maker-the-world-is-now-a-playground" title="Playground Maker: The world is now a playground">Playground Maker</a>), fine art exhibitions, Banksy, Nam Jun Paik].
 
 <blockquote>Other experiments show that different works by the same creator exhibit a recognizable style or 'voice', and that this same recognizable quality even comes through in different creative outlets. [similar to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auteur_theory">Auteur Theory</a>]</blockquote>
 
 Whatever the idea it is, they retain the same characteristics: social realism, playfulness, experience, and public settings.
 
 <blockquote>The conception of the task changes through interaction with the worldview, and the worldview changes through interaction with the task.</blockquote>
 
 Committing to an idea, doing the work, and completing it, is the difficult part because while working my values change and I re-evaluate my work; I want to do something new, or, I care for something else more. Why make a game when there's a slum nearby? Why take pictures of people, when I could work at a NGO?
 
 It's quite difficult finding the balance to complete long form works -- to stay in one place, work regularly. It requires creating a positive working environment, which reinforces my initial values, so that I don't chase differently valued idea. I need to share my idea with everyone around me, so that people support me, providing social feedback, until the work is complete.
 
 But I'm straying away from the subject: the creative process -- not work.
 
 Nearly every time I move, I have to explore, find something to do, and do it. Taking in the world and making out something concrete.
 
 Moving, physically changing the world, is not required to changed one's worldview. Some life experience, especially serious, could do it. Media at times imparts so much power that one's worldview is changed, as mine is at the end of many films. Perhaps LSD trips are similar to hypomania in a new country. For me, moving, traveling, above media and life, has been the most potent method. 1942 2014-05-08 12:39:29 2014-05-08 16:39:29 open closed my-creative-process-honing-theory-and-nomadism publish 0 0 post 0 Art Philosophy Psychology _edit_last 1 _wp_old_slug my-creative-process-and-honing-theory _yoast_wpseo_primary_category Prose is Superfluous: Active Communication through Play and Art http://rahilpatel.com/blog/prose-is-superfluous-active-communication-through-play-and-art Sat, 03 May 2014 18:17:43 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=1944 <h2>Thesis</h2>
 As one gets older, one cumulates concepts, only the content [in life and media] changes slightly, the content of target is often prose, which itself is often superfluous.
 
 <h2>Learning</h2>
 When learning a new [to the learner] concept, prose can be omitted. It is only there to communicate what's one knows to another person, or to validate it in writing. And even then, it's quite difficult. For example, as some professor said, try to explain a bike ride, physically. Everyone knows how bikes work: you pedal, the chain goes around the gears, which in turn turns wheels, but describing the mechanics precisely requires much effort and time. The force pressed down at a certain angle of the rider's foot results in a certain centrifugal force, blah blah blah.
 
 People learn concepts quickly, sometimes instantly, through play [life], games, film, and whatever other new mediums.
 
 If one knows how several concepts work, at least without the drudgery of standard notation, why slow children down by teaching them standard notation? If one removes writing, children would be able to grasp far more complex concepts. Then, when it comes time to actually write, that is, to prove a new concept or discovery, one may need to finally learn how to explain it through writing. Isn't this more practical, time-efficient, resulting in more exploration and discovery?
 
 To conclude, the process of learning is backwards. Schools teach kids to learn a concept, then learn how to write it. The writing is superfluous, a hindrance, limiting. It can be skipped. Kids should learning, until there is reason to write.
 
 Edit: A later thought. Writing is often used as a way to test the individual's knowledge. This is a good reason. But perhaps there should be a better way of testing then.
 
 <h3>Art</h3>
 There are many instances in art that I feel prose is superfluous. The medium of art should be chosen by the artist to best display their feeling. If the medium is not literature, then writing should likely be a very small part, if at all.
 
 <h3>Literature</h3>
 I've always had a problem with reading. I could talk about things I like, but otherwise, I'd dread reading. I consistently scored poorly in English classes. My dad embarrassingly, but now I feel with great care, bought me Hooked on Phonics. It didn't work.
 
 Why would a 15 year old care about The Great Gatsby? As a 15 year old I didn't even understand the modern world, how could I grasp the 1920s? What's the point of all of that content, description. I'd rather have watched a film and take it all in within the time frame of a single class, instead of spending several weeks.
 
 Perhaps it was because reading is a passive activity. Sure, reading and talking about it together in class helps, but it still didn't evoke much activity. Or, not enough to hold my attention.
 
 It wasn't until I read Invisible Cities by Italo Calvino that I felt the amount of words used was not superfluous. Reading it felt great. I'd read a piece, think about it, perhaps create my own ideas, and be satisfied.
 
 Literature should only have enough words [content] to convey an idea. Any more is superfluous.
 
 <h3>Graphic Novels, Comics, and Photography</h3>
 Graphic novels (and comics), the natural step up from literature, often convey meaning without prose. Sure, there's dialog, but in good graphic novels, imagery, sequence, and framing deliver meaning. Interpretation is to be made of framing and what happens between frames. If there's too much prose, then it might as well be literature. There is a clear distinction between the two.
 
 I've only read a handful, but reading (looking at) Watchmen was an extremely contemplative experience. I was only able to read a chapter per session, sometimes only a few pages. It left so much to think about up to the reader, all of this, with little to no prose.
 
 [I don't normally consume photography, but I felt it belongs in the same category.]
 
 <h3>Film</h3>
 The more films I watched, the less prose they had. They focused on the other aspects of film: cinematography -- imagery, screenplay -- sequence of images, body motion of actors; to express feeling and ideas. The film, that is, the video, is the the center of the medium, not the dialog.
 
 Some of my favorite directors such as Hirokazu Koreeda, Tsai Ming-Liang, and Edward Yang use very little dialog. Without dialog, the viewer watches more intensely at the image and actions. It asks the viewer to be a little more active, to think, to reflect. Not of comprehension of the narrative of the film, but how one's own experiences and world views -- knowledge of psychology, economic systems, culture, human development -- interact with the film.
 
 Usually if a narrator has to inform the viewer, it's a failure of the film. Hence my indifference toward most documentaries.
 
 <h3>Game</h3>
 Games usually don't have much prose. I currently can't think of many. JRPGs and film-like video games? Those are dated. Early use of video games.
 
 Games, the most active form of the arts thus far mentioned, is a medium that has the ability to omit prose entirely. Playground games often don't have prose, only in its rules. Card games also don't have prose, just numbers and/or shapes; If the cards do contain text, it's often necessary to to the game -- a rule of the game. Think about this: Take any video game, strip it of it's prose, and it's very likely the game is still playable. It's just extraneous content. I remember as a child I'd continuously mash buttons through text because I knew it was unnecessary (and because the content sucked compared to the quality of literature). The method of communication of a game is play, not prose.
 
 <h2>Conclusion</h2>
 The method of communication of life is not prose, it's play. It's the sensory input and response stimuli, the interaction, the resulting affect it has on the mind. Prose cannot interact. Few prose are powerful enough to elicit response on the level of an interaction in real life. And even then, another medium likely could have been chosen to do the same thing in a more efficient manner. Prose is ancient. Passive mediums are old. Learning through prose is directional, but passive, uncreative, and inefficient (requiring skimming). The most practical and efficient use of prose is merely for reference, usually in the form of a Wikipedia article, or a quick Google search (a modern form of skimming).

 What's actually needed?
 
 A vocational school suffice for most positions in the developed world, including the the most revered professions.
 
 From high school to the highest degree, what are people doing? What work is being done? What is being produced? What is learned? I don't understand. Other than top universities in research, arts, science, and philosophy, what are students doing in every other school? The answer probably is nothing. Or worse, being conditioned to do nothing.
 
 It it possible to replace an entire curriculum with practical work, inside real workplaces? Would it be more inefficient than school? Wouldn't the motivation and reward of practical work be provide a better moral system than grades?
 
 It seems the problem is merely a matter of placing people in the right places at the right time. Should that be left to agency, the inhuman game of sending resumes? I feel it critical to teach the child to take action to find work within their interests, or even to simply try something practical. Hopefully before then, they've learned how to learn other things, and use free time off of work to learn.
 
 Thankfully, with the internet, it's become easier to meet the right people to do things of shared interest. If one lives in a city, just google nearby organizations, go to their organization, and talk to them. That's it.
 
 I have no idea how the world of professional businesses have become so steeped in inhuman beliefs. Did media proliferate this? 1954 2014-05-03 00:34:39 2014-05-03 04:34:39 open closed the-ideal-method-of-learning publish 0 0 post 0 Life Personal Philosophy Philosophy of Education _edit_last 1 Books, Passive Media, and The Internet http://rahilpatel.com/blog/books-passive-media-and-the-internet Tue, 06 May 2014 05:24:18 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=1972 [Old draft, posting anyway.

 A continuation of the thoughts from
 
 It's been a long time since I've explored via traditional media, as opposed to empiricism (travel travel travel, and interactive art!).
 
 A certain Peter told me about http://www.thegreatcourses.com/ (piratebay has it).
 
 I always feel that going through anything historical is a waste of time (adhd adhd adhd, and creativity!), but there's definitely some good things in there.
 
 I enjoy the great ideas in philosophy lectures, which I apparently severely lack as a result of attending a non-liberal arts college. There's 60 of them. I especially liked these: Wittgenstein (soo goood, probably because most modern), Alan Turing, Aesthetics, Theory of Good Life, Descartes, and Newton. I've skimmed through most of the rest.
 
 It's still a very passive thing, that requires a very passive time in life to actually listen to (programming indoors). You really have to select a narrow selection of interest to make any use of it. But it's far more thought-provoking than, say, music. And more concise than most books (even with the convenience of audiobooks -- I tried Guns, Germs, and Steel with interest and intent and still struggled), which allows more time to think. Still, it's not up to date with any modern theories; For that of course, there's Wikipedia (can transform text to audio!).
 
 Which brings a question: If you work a lone job indoors, say an office environment, without cool people to be distracted by, what do you do with that free time, how and what do you explore? Or did you end up finding a creative outlet indoors?
 
 tldr: books suck.

 The conversation on Facebook that brought about this thought:
 
 A person way smarter than me said:
 History is one of the best fields to study if you want to figure out long-term
 trends in human consciousness. I would argue that history is very interesting, but has problems with presentation. Case in point, I used to not be at all interested in the time period between the industrial revolution in american history, but now see it as fundamental in establishing movements in the Christian right and eventually leading to the moral majority and ultimately Sarah Palin. (This is an idea that's far too big to contain here, obviously. I should probably write a book!) That's just one aspect of the cultural shift in America as well. When someone says they think history is boring, I believe they aren't reading it correctly, and are probably basing their opinion on the way history was taught to them, rather than how history actually is.
 
 Guns Germs and Steel's author has a long-winded style; he likes to cover all the bases, all the time. Don't judge non-fiction by that.
 
 Also, books are awesome. You engage differently when faced with long-form text than you do when you are listening. One isn't better than the other because they are different scales.
 
 I'd be interested in the "modern theories" you allude to that Wikipedia fulfills, but Hofstadter doesn't.
 
 I naively replied:
 So much to learn from Sir Ben.
 
 It's probably my fault for failing to share my thoughts on reading, which even then should result in writing out thoughts. Perhaps it's because it's not as sensational as other media. It usually just feels goalless, where does reading huge texts lead to?
 
 Oh god American history was always the least interesting of all histories to me, hah. Probably because it's span is short relative to other countries.
 
 Hahahah The Formation of Sarah Palin. That would be one disgusting yet interesting book.
 
 Guns, Germs, and Steel is quite alright, mostly because I'm really interested in it's huge scope of anthropology. I'll probably regain the interest when I'm interested in the subject again, or doing something related to it.
 
 Listening vs reading. That'll require some research.
 
 I meant The Great Courses doesn't have much modern material, Hofstadter I haven't read yet. Modern theories, I guess I mean philosophy and research of life-related things: happiness, mental illness (and it's biology -- esp. dopamine-related ones), learning, playing, etc. Hence my recent urge for non-fiction books.
 
 It just seems to be so much more fun and efficient exploring Wikipedia, and a more active (I have more choice than just skimming) way of learning, and finding interesting, specific subjects. I think it would be very easy to have a Wikipedia session on American History, hop around links, and figure out The Formation of Sarah Palin. All of that in a more efficient and fun manner than fat books in a library on American History.
 
 THE INTERNETS!
 
 ...
 
 I guess the target books are: non-narrative, non-fiction, broad in scope, like Guns.., Godel..., Thinking Fast and Slow, Antifragile, etc. Not the most playful things, haha. 1972 2014-05-06 01:24:18 2014-05-06 05:24:18 open closed books-passive-media-and-the-internet publish 0 0 post 0 Communication Humanities Literature Media New Media Philosophy Philosophy of Education Philosophy of Technology _edit_last 1 Island Nations and Globalization http://rahilpatel.com/blog/island-nations-and-globalization Wed, 07 May 2014 13:59:22 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=1979 This post along with several others including related posts, <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/creativity-external-stimuli-cities-and-suburbs" title="Creativity, External Stimuli, Cities, and Suburbs">Creativity, External Stimuli, Cities, and Suburbs</a> and <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/taiwan-and-japan-active-and-passive-lifestyles" title="Taiwan and Japan: Active and Passive Lifestyles">Taiwan and Japan: Active and Passive Lifestyles</a>, were all written during my 10 day visa run in Okinawa.
 
 Okinawa, as I mentioned in past posts is a scary boring suburb. The streets are empty at all times of the day. Well, empty of pedestrians; There's tons of cars. Even the main street in it's largest city is empty. Lone business men dressed in high quality black sacks, black shoes, and an Hawaiian [flower patterned] shirt can be spotted in some neighborhoods with a bag from a nearby convenience store filled with individual sized food and drink. Nobody else is outside. Inside, people laze around passively consuming media on their computers and television. Instead of socializing, people stand outside and smoke. Everyone smokes.
 
 Anyway, this post isn't about the current status of this place, or more ranting about suburbs, rather how it came to be, or, how I imagine it came to be, because that will lead to more broad answers. How did Okinawa turn into such a boring suburb? Or is it no different from any other suburb in Japan, and therefore not worth investigating?
 
 Looking at the Wikipedia article, it was annexed during the Meiji Restoration, then the battle of Okinawa killed 1/4th, U.S. owned it in 1945 to 1962, which explains the vintage vibe of A&Ws and Blue Seal ice cream, then returned back to Japan.
 
 Were Okinawans, with their own culture, whom refer themselves different from mainlanders much different? Were they far less developed than the mainland? One certainly gets the feeling that these people were farmers, but development turned them into office workers. Both jobs are mechanical, requiring human machines, the only difference is technology. One starts to wonder if Jared Diamond (of Guns, Germ, and Steel) was right. The only difference between the two [farmers and office workers, or Papuans and, well, the rest of the world] is technology, not intelligence. People are cultured to use the computer. With media, especially with popular television shows and manga, language can be learned passively.
 
 As I watch people, I feel no difference from these people and those in far less developed countries. The people at this hostel in Okinawa work, walk, talk, smoke, and sleep no different than the people I encountered Laos. The Okinawans that work at my hostel cook simple foods, read manga all day, and sleep at any time of the day. The one's that I can visibly see working are drone office workers. The only difference between the two, it feels, is technology and money. In Okinawa, there are vending machines to replace humans, machines to count change in cash registers, machines at home to cook food, cars, a monorail, bland apartment buildings, and the normal things suburbs have. 
 
 I feel the result modern Okinawa is attributed to the fact that it is an island. Islands are usually less developed since they don't attract as many intelligent people as mainlands -- a place with interconnected cities -- do. I imagine all island nations face this problem. Before the advent of budget flights or ferries, there wasn't easy access to move to an urban center.
 
 But Okinawa has money, which is what makes it more perplexing. Did U.S. bases provide income? Did tourism? Why is the standard of living in Okinawa, a place with the highest amount of centurions (people aged over 100) in the world, so high? I feel that the latter is targeted toward less developed Okinawa. The ones that eat fish and tofu, and live the expected tropical life. Something that seems to exist only in imagination, my preconception of a tropical island. In reality, the entire island is developed, just as the entirety of Japan and Korea are. Rural areas still have convenient stores and modern facilities.
 
 Perhaps some genetics are at play. Perhaps Okinawans are genetically diligent, non-hedonistic, stress-free, with high self-control (they invented Karate). The change in technology did not affect this, instead, they adapted. From diligent rice farmers to diligent office workers with nice cars, their attitude remain unaltered. Or perhaps those stats are for the older generation, and the next few generations will die younger.
 
 I don't know where this post was going. Island Nations and Globalization? I guess I just find globalization overwhelming. It never makes sense to me. And island nations that globalize are even more mind-bottling because they often retain thousands years of culture and genetics (simply because it's surrounded by water), and then suddenly take in technology, without immigration or emigration of it's people or other peoples.
 
 Okinawa must not have been sudden, as people handle technology extremely well. In Laos, I've seen plastic landfills. What would happen if you gave a Papuan a vending machine?
 
 Thinking about the modernization of Okinawa is probably no different than thinking about the modernization Chinese cities right now: places that received a surplus of money in a short span of time, and the natural unfolding of what people do with it, and how the people adapt. It's non-sensical, unfair, scary, and utterly interesting. 1979 2014-05-07 09:59:22 2014-05-07 13:59:22 closed closed island-nations-and-globalization publish 0 0 post 0 Anthropology Philosophy Travel _edit_last 1 Okinawana is Inhospitable http://rahilpatel.com/blog/okinawana-is-inhospitable Thu, 08 May 2014 15:17:15 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=1983 Building up on past posts (<a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/island-nations-and-globalization" title="Island Nations and Globalization">Island Nations and Globalization</a>, <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/taiwan-and-japan-active-and-passive-lifestyles" title="Taiwan and Japan: Active and Passive Lifestyles">Taiwan and Japan: Active and Passive Lifestyles</a>, <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/creativity-external-stimuli-cities-and-suburbs" title="Creativity, External Stimuli, Cities, and Suburbs">Creativity, External Stimuli, Cities, and Suburbs</a>) about my time in Okinawa, I feel that the inhabitants of Okinawa, in addition to living an extremely suburban lifestyle, are very cold.
 
 There were several instances during my trip I experienced this.
 
 On my first day, I had to find a hostel that had rooms and was cheap. I starred three on Google Maps and went to the closest one to the metro station. No one was at the desk. When one came, I talked, found out they didn't have dormitories, then ask for other hostels, she said she doesn't know any others. (pause). The next hostel I went to, a girl opened a door slightly, said it was full, and nearly closed it, as if it were a mean person's house. I was able to talk into using their wifi for a moment while I called a few hostels, although she seemed quite angry. The final hostel, the one I ended up staying in, again had no one at the reception. Once he came, I was able to get a room, but that was it. No greeting, no tour of the hostel's facilities, or anything.
 
 During my stay at the hostel, there was never an instance where I was asked if I needed anything. When I asked about touristy things, like ferry schedules, bus numbers, snorkel locations, things to do, things to eat, they all say they don't know. The staff eat and live at the hostel eat together, watch TV and smoke, all day, all done separately from customers.
 
 Luckily, there were a few people at the hostel of exception; One worker and her boyfriend were more hippie -- they had a little more energy. There were also two other foreigners, and Aussie and Englishman, both with tens times more energy than any Okinawan. The Australian girl continued in her own world, and told me she didn't understand what the people at the hostel ever did -- are they workers, do they have other work, or do they just watch TV and read manga all day? She didn't care much though; she just loves snorkeling. The English guy learned Japanese out of the country for several years, and now lives between Osaka and Kyoto. He's somehow able to talk to us and be similarly energetic, yet act completely Japanese at other times, smoking outside, and not talking to anyone. I was able to have few meals with these four people.
 
 During my stay in Naha in general, there was little to no interaction with everyone. Shopkeepers mechanically sell goods for their company. When I ask people on the street for directions, some point a direction, some say they don't know, and some don't respond at all. I don't think it's a language barrier problem either because many surprisingly respond in English, and if not, they understand when I say "marketto wa doko deska?". Otherwise, the streets are quite bare, and the people just weren't interesting enough for me to want to engage in conversation. Looking at the way others interact, I believe it's the least social place I've encountered. People just don't chat with people they don't know. There were few people walking alongside another person. Everyone walked alone, without headphones or a cell phone. Just walking robotically toward wherever they needed to go. It's rare to encounter any social activity outside of a house, bar, or family restaurant. This aspect is most frightening to me, and brings about the whole dystopian human robot future, with an average of two vending machines and one other kind of machine per block.
 
 Today:
 I wanted to go snorkeling. I of course had to plan everything because the staff did not know. I took a nearly empty bus full of people who clearly did not want to socialize. I arrived at a snorkel spot and only had goggles, not the snorkel. So, I asked people if I could rent or buy one. The first shop, which provides tours for snorkeling and scuba diving and had two tub full of fresh snorkels said no. Not even for two hours. The second shop also said no, because they were closing in an hour and a half. They only allowed renting, not buying (the rental price equivalent to the buying price). They also mentioned that the snorkel spot was closed -- I won't delve into to the East Asian safety culture observation. I was a little flustered, and said "This is crazy!". To which one of the guys, who spoke English quite well, replied "This is Japan!". I'm not sure what the meaning behind that was. It seems he acknowledged some cultural differences. Did he mean Japan is law-abiding, overly-safe, unhelpful people? <strong>How can one acknowledge their own culture's negative characteristics and act according to it</strong>?
 
 At the beach next to the closed cape, two tour guided groups snorkel in shallow waters in full wet suits. Oh right, no safety talk.
 
 After snorkeling a bit, I walked back toward the main road, one of the shop workers that denied me of a snorkel stood outside, now with two others beside him, eager to chat. I gave the normal travel chat. They asked how I was going to get back. I said hitchhike, if not, the bus. They thought I was cool and also thought hitchhiking is possible. No help, but at least they displayed a hint of interest. They informed me that it was illegal to hitchhike. Thanks.
 
 A good test of hospitality is the amount of time it takes to hitchhike. Taiwan took about 5 cars. Okinawa took 3 hours, and when I mentioned I wanted to go to Naha, the young guy nearly drove off. I had to stop him to ask him to take me however far he was going in the same direction. I spotted a bus stop and told him to stop me there. The thought taking me in the same direction or finding a bus stop did not cross his mind.
 
 I took a bus back. This time the people were sleeping, perhaps tired from work. I didn't have quite enough cash. I knew, but I wanted to test their hospitality further. The bus driver said it was okay. Finally. One hospitable moment.
 
 On the way back to the hostel, I stopped by a supermarket, bought some meat (using credit card), took it to the hostel, cooked it, ate it, all alone. Alone, alongside two other people eating individual portioned food from convenient stores.

 In Tokyo, I also wasn't able to, or often, just did not want to engage in conversation with many Japanese people, probably because they all seem disinterested, in everything, including people. Perhaps this applies to all of Japan, but even more so to the suburbs of it, including Okinawa.
 
 As a person who's recently lived in one of social countries in Asia (Taiwan) I am perhaps more frightened. The Australian girl who was from the suburbs managed well with having fun alone, then Facebooking and blogging at night. In contrast, I've been dying of social outlet, hence the mass amount of writing during my stay here. In Taiwan, I didn't write anything, because I was able to let my thoughts out by talking, socializing. I couldn't live here. No social person could. It's inhospitable to most, except for a few others who live a similar culture. 1983 2014-05-08 11:17:15 2014-05-08 15:17:15 open closed okinawana-is-inhospitable publish 0 0 post 0 Anthropology Travel _edit_last 1 Methods of Sustaining Creativity in The Same Place http://rahilpatel.com/blog/methods-of-sustaining-creativity-in-the-same-place Sat, 10 May 2014 08:38:32 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=1999 [Old draft.

 Physical and alone. Another technique to extend hypomania, and creativity, is to continually create new experiences. One way is to change work places, to change external stimuli. A new park, cafe, shared workspace, street, protest, train, wherever.
 
 Physical and social. A better method is to create new social experiences. Cook dinner for friends, have picnic at a park, play a game, talk, discuss, do something with other people.

Basically, how does one sustain life while consistently creating?]
 
 Exercise! It's kind of needed. But it doesn't have to be routine, or boring.
 
 In college, I started with P90X. It provided an all around good balance of Anaerobic exercises, but it was too slow. I normally like to just release all of my energy, then go back to work. Perhaps I was working too hard back then. I then used Insanity. With more plyometrics I was able to tire myself quicker. It also used my own routine's order: quick cardio to tire self (warm up), workout, minimal cool down. After completing both, I usually combined the two, and just did whatever exercises depending on which body part was not tired.
 
 Sometimes I'd just have a lot of energy, especially after over-sleeping on a Friday or Saturday night after a work week. I love biking. I can bike forever. Especially through cities. Exploring and biking. Running works too, but it's not nearly as fun, and it's just not good for the knees.
 
 Of course there are more creative forms of exercise; The past exercises were because I had sedentary jobs.
 
 Mixed martial arts is appealing. But it seems to require much time and effort going to a teacher 'n all, so I never bothered. I do however incorporate kicks and punches in my routine. Some kind of shadowboxing. Besides, nobody fights anymore. And going to a teacher is not very creative.
 
 In comes two non-fighting exercises: dancing (freestyle breakdancing) and parkour. Both of which I'd consider arts. Dancing, usually, interacts less with environment than parkour, therefore I find less interesting. There's a lot to explore in dancing, but it's usually more with the body and floor (if alone). Dancing as an art, as opposed to exercise, is quite different. Parkour, however, is creative , explorative, and always offers exercise.
 
 Instead of exercising in a room in front of a monitor or fitness instructor, you explore an environment, figure out the most efficient way to get from point A to point B, or the most stylish way (Freerunning), whichever.
 
 I feel that it's a natural extension of my childhood. I used to jump off swings, jump over ditches and fences, bike, run, dive, do whatever was needed to not get tagged. It was fun. Parkour is just an adult version of those playground games I used to play, now with a name.
 
 todo: further thinking
 How can exercise positively affect the world?
 - generate power, social / community, teach discipline, public bicycles (replaces wasteful transportation)

 p90x
 All around a great workout. It focuses on a seperate group of muscles for each routine, spreading the workload out over a course of a week. It contains yoga, cardio, weight lifting, etc.
 
 Insanity
 This is far more focused on cardio and plyometrics, break your knee shit.
 
 I'd recommend buying p90x and trying Insanity (borrow from a friend). There's some ideas I like in Insanity. I like that you don't start out with stretches, instead you start with a burst of cardio, stretch, then work out. I also like that Insanity encourages you to only take a minimal break (a few seconds) then get right back into the rigorous routine. This helps me push myself.
 
 I was able to get through p90x without prior workout fairly easily, only slowing down on certain workouts (arms). I had to take a few second breaks every now and then in Insanity.
 
 Prior to both workouts, I did my own elementary P.E. exercises and either ran or biked around the city. I've always had a small, thin build, but able to do perform well athletically.

Great for personal history. Guessed publishing date.]
 
 During my time in Taipei the second time I experienced the apex of mania and creativity.
 
 WORDPRESS WTF. See paragraph at end then come back.
 
 I'd go to art venues, art events, see traditional neighborhoods, and generally be fascinated about people and culture: the old people near Longshan Temple, food cart vendors, kids dressed homogeneously, girls taking selfies, people selling betel nuts, people holding signs on the side of a road. I'd wonder what they were thinking about. I'd consume Humans of New York and Tsai-Ming Liang films. I wanted to stay on the streets. I became a person of the streets. My perspective altered (probably along with my perception on reality). I'd be disgusted by commercial streets and expensive tea NT$30 ($1) tea shops. I'd be disgusted at myself for buying a cup. During the day I'd take naps outside. Sometimes I'd skip taking a shower as I didn't want to miss class (and because the water would be cold at times).
 
 At the cost of efficiency, I'd find ways to make work more sociable. Instead of using the internet to find an apartment, I'd physically walk around a neighborhood I liked, look for red "for rent" signs, and call people. I'd then use the Taiwanese website to find rooms, which was in Chinese. I maximized Chinese learning by making my life more adventurous.
 
 At first If found class useless. Why would anyone need it? It didn't make sense. During the 20 minute commute to class I could read and listen to a chapter, while listening in on real conversations and looking at Chinese signs all around.
 
 I focused entirely on dialogue. I bought a cheap radio and listened to it when I wasn't talking to people, actually listening to it. I'd use a smartphone application to find words. If I ever was indoors, it would be at the hostel with a TV on with subtitles on, focusing on the dialog and Chinese characters.
 
 I listened well. I spoke well. But I think the learning was impaired. There was little to no scaffolding in my personal study. That is where class supported me. And although the class was slow, inhibiting my urge to talk, I failed to write Chinese. I came to the conclusion that it was useless to write. Recognizing Chinese character is enough, I thought. But using good students a model, I found that despite my high-consumption life, good students performed better. I gained more vocabulary, but my grammar was scattered. I should have read more of the book instead of using an application for grammar words.
 
 After some time, I started Humans of Taipei. It coincided with my goal to learn mandarin, my fascination for people, and extreme response to external stimuli. I did it all in an extremely anxious pace, resulting in somewhat poor results.
 
 After a month and a half, I struggled to keep the pace, and winter weather came closer. Then, suddenly, the sun disappeared completely behind a permanent haze. I couldn't handle the sudden change. I reacted by sleeping. Hibernating. For a week. At some point I bought ticket to India, which had warmer temperature and more sunlight. I escaped a week later.
 
 
 
 Goal:
 Mania provides a ton of creativity, but the goal should be to leverage it as a tool to provide ideas, then control it to do the work. Continue this cycle.
 
 And, during my travels, this is exactly what I did. I worked in cycles. If there wasn't a product in two weeks, I'd move on. I'd enter a new city or town, wander, figure out something to do within the mania, then put all of effort in executing it. Sometimes it's successful, other times it wasn't -- I'd work too inconsistently or I'd have another idea and think the old one is inferior.
 
 I was already enrolled in Mandarin class. After class, I'd explore Taipei with high anxiety wanted to do something but never wanting to settle on one.

 second paragraph:
 I had come enrolled to Mandarin class. After class, I'd explore Taipei with high anxiety, simultaneously wanted to seek out fine art, jobs, and possibly teach. Instead of working, I spent every day outside for as long as possible, finding ways to socialize with people, as my goal was to learn Mandarin. 3355 2014-05-01 06:42:01 2014-05-01 10:42:01 open closed the-apex-of-mania-and-creativity-in-taipei publish 0 0 post 0 Personal _edit_last 1 _wp_old_slug 3355 Hypomania and Creativity http://rahilpatel.com/blog/hypomania-and-creativity Tue, 10 Jun 2014 12:24:53 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=1938 The times I felt <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/hypomania">hypomanic</a>, I felt these were some of my most creative times in my life.
 
 Creativity and productivity are separate. Creativity is the process of creating ideas. Productivity is implementing them.
 
 During mania, I am so creative (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_psychiatry#Flight_of_ideas">flight of ideas</a>) that I continue consuming (sensually) and creating new ideas. The problem is that I never want to settle one. How does one choose one to work on? How can any work be worth the time? As a person with a limited lifetime, wouldn't it be <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/constant-art-ethics" title="Constant Art Ethics">efficient to only work on things with high effect low work ratio</a>?
 
 At this time I felt that even spending time to implement art onto a medium was a waste of time. Isn't performance better, netting a direct result?
 
 My work moved from medium to direct interaction, experiences. It supplied faster feedback, which was crucial as I worked alone. <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/creativity-as-organization-from-chaos" title="Creativity as Organization from Chaos">Travel is the best way to consume the most amount of information, and a constant stream of performance-oriented events seemed the ideal way to create something based on that information</a>. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/TaiwanesePeople">Humans of Taipei</a> and Vincent Moon documentary-like videos.
 
 Perhaps that's true, but during the time, I forget, all information is not useful. And even good performances and documentation require some work, though, less than it used to. 1938 2014-06-10 08:24:53 2014-06-10 12:24:53 open closed hypomania-and-creativity publish 0 0 post 0 Philosophy Psychology Schizoid Personality Disorder _edit_last 1 Learning via Empericism http://rahilpatel.com/blog/learning-via-empericism Fri, 30 May 2014 18:56:27 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=1966 [todo: This post is just a flow of thoughts. Need to structure it and separate into different blog posts.]
 
 I've learned most of the things I know through empiricism. If not, through film.
 
 While listening to The Great Courses, I've learned that philosophy can be gained from several sources: arts (dance, drama, etc.), dialogs, literature, history, and that's where I stopped the lecture.
 
 I stopped it because my brain wanted to create. Talk back to it. Write something about it. Blog it. It seems My short attention span gained while living in cities leads to far more creativity than consumption.
 
 Back to that single line from the lecture, whether one learns from a performance or interview by George Carlin (art and dialog), a game or lecture by Jonathan Blow (art and dialog), or from their mother (conversation). The lessons are universal; It's philosophy. People learn (philosophy) by living. Consuming. I imagine one could learn a lot by simply reading The Illiad. Perhaps The Illiad alone covers 90% of all popular media.
 
 But what if the person does not find literature sensational enough? Then one turns to film. But what if one doesn't find film sensational enough? Then one turns to life. Travel. Go to different places. Meet people. Do different jobs. Empiricism.
 
 I think it's a problem for people, especially creative types, schizotypes, ones with ADHD or similar dopamine related problems. Traditional education is not engaging enough. One is likely to quite school early. Media is not enough; It's too passive. One can consume media simultaneously living a life: walking, talking, working, consuming and interacting locally. One moves to the city, where more people feel this way, have more events, social gatherings, social interaction.
 
 But how much is really learned from empiricism (todo: link to optimal learning life)? What is really gained from empiricism that books cannot give?
 
 Perhaps it's just the perception of a person with too much dopamine, that one is less receptive to knowledge from passive mediums and traditional education, where there is not enough sensation.
 
 But if the environment of instruction is too constraining, not allowing enough critical thinking, then perhaps it isn't, and it is at fault. Compared to traditional education, empiricism is more creative and fun, but uneven and inefficient. In traditional education everyone is learned the same things in a rather similar fashion, unless one's teachers and peers were great, which is based on where your parents were born, which is based on chance. But what about with a more empirical life, one chooses what to learn, which itself seems a little hedonistic. If one chooses to quit school and pursue something, with sheer motivation, isn't that a better choice?
 
 Back to the question, what is learned from empiricism that books cannot?
 
 The only difference is that, in empiricism, one has an actual sensory experience linked to it. Which again, in creative people would trigger some emotion, which I think is important in motivation, which leads to more thoughts and contemplation.
 
 If I had not travelled to tribal areas, would I have ever thought so deeply about them, to urge me to read Guns, Germs, and Steel? If Jared Diamond didn't go to Papua New Guinea where that Papuan did not ask him why Papuans did not gain cargo, and instead read it in a book, would it have had the same effect, leading to writing a giant book about it? Perhaps if some sort of media came across about tribal areas, would it have created an equally deep effect, to cause us to do something?
 
 Which direction is better? Experience then research, because the motivation of the experience drives it. Or research then experience, to prove it?
 
 To me, an emotional person, experience then research. I imagine most art goes in this direction too: an experience becomes inscribed to a medium. But to a less emotional person, the other way around.
 
 Imannual Kant would be a good example for the other way. He never left 10 miles from his home. He was able to write papers that reached far out to natural history and space. In his Critique of Pure Reason, he's argues synthetic knowledge a priori truths, having concepts of things without empirical knowledge. He dug deep into philosophy, deeper than many ever have, probably because he did live a blunt, undistracted life. His drive is usually led from the writings of others, in this case, Hume's skepticism of Hume's empiricism.
 
 A similar case with Stephen Hawkings, a person with motor handicaps who wrote theories and books about space.
 
 I feel empiricism leads to breadth instead of depth. Interdisciplinary thinking. But it requires great control and some time digging deep, to produce anything useful from it.
 
 Why is empiricism linked to hedonism? Why do creatives go to cities, where hippies become hipsters, and lose those values they had before they went in?
 
 It must be a lack of self-control in consumption, and living in a city, where capitalism is at large, can be difficult to ignore.
 
 Travel also costs money. But it doesn't cost money to walk, bicycle, and it's quite cheap to travel by bus, far better than single passenger cars. With budget flights, empiricism has become quite affordable.
 
 I feel I've learned a lot by living in a simple apartment in New York walking the streets, attending free events from higher education and art events from great artists.
 
 Is it better to be hipster (a hippie who lives in the city) than a hippie? Isn't the experience gained from living in a village in China greater than the experience than eating dumpling in Chinatown? What do cities have that the world does not?
 
 Smart people.
 
 Even if one had all the money to travel the world, one still has that essential human need of social interaction. Not through books, but through talking, performances, and events. Learning through people, as opposed to books. 1966 2014-05-30 14:56:27 2014-05-30 18:56:27 open closed learning-via-empericism publish 0 0 post 0 Life Philosophy Philosophy of Education Travel _edit_last 1 Lateral Thinking, External Stimuli, and Self-Control http://rahilpatel.com/blog/lateral-thinking-external-stimuli-and-self-control Thu, 22 May 2014 10:23:48 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=2033 [Old draft. I don't think I got to the self-control part.

 A thought from Ben's post, and my stay at Simon's house.
 
 Ben said that I felt Wikipedia helps <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lateral_thinking">lateral thinking</a> (probably link from passive media post), which is helpful with creativity.
 
 Later I moved to a friend's house, in a city, but in the 14th floor of an apartment, and working in an office. There was little to no external stimuli going on. Or, my receptiveness was low to the external stimuli. Boredom has ensued.
 
 If one consumes what they want to consume, that is, what they probably know, what comes out of it?
 
 In a suburb what new can someone consume? Only media is new. Books, films, and now, the internet. If one interacts solely digitally for new interactions, new inquiries, where does this life lead? Does one become more inclined to do digital things? A reduction in real interaction? Is this where cities and Taipei win?
 
 The culture of the suburbs does not provide as much external stimuli, distractions, narrowing thought, creating more focus at the cost of creativity. To me, it's more ideal to live in a distracting city, and leave it up to me to make sense of it, trap myself in a room, and make something. It's Veidt vs Rorshach. Rorshach's method is direct, empericial, in the perspective of the lowest of men. In the physical world of distraction he creates his own method of solving problems, without self control. Veidt gains distraction through the form of 12 TVs. And through it he finds links, without the distraction of emotion, and creates a more rational solution, lateral thinking with self-control. Perhaps that's what it comes down to: I'm too emotional; I need cities to drive me. I have no self-control.
 
 At the height of my hypomania and creativity, I stayed outside as much as I could, with people. Consuming everything.
 
 Now at my lowest, I am consuming nothing. Not making decisions at every second. Mindlessly doing things.
 
 I believe, it's the lack of external stimuli.
 
 Throughout my travels, I never stayed out far from people. Cities, towns. I can't hike for longer than a few hours. The external stimuli disappears, then no thoughts comes to mind. I'm just hiking or biking or whatever. No reason. Perhaps I daydream. Whatever it is, there's no direction, I lose interest, I go back to civilization. 2033 2014-05-22 06:23:48 2014-05-22 10:23:48 open closed lateral-thinking-external-stimuli-and-self-control publish 0 0 post 0 Art Thoughts _edit_last 1 Philosophy from Media versus Life; New York versus the World http://rahilpatel.com/blog/philosophy-from-media-versus-life-new-york-versus-the-world Tue, 24 Jun 2014 05:08:55 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=2040 Is New York the best place to struggle because people are constantly on the verge of being broke, forced to make every hour count?
 
 I just watched The Lego Movie, and it reminds me of what scares me most about my impending return to New York, and more general, America: media.
 
 The film is entirely hypocritical. The underlying themes are creativity and capitalism, yet itself contradicts both. The hypocrisy in capitalism: film is produced is based on a product [Lego], produced by Warner Bros., casted with Hollywood icons, and filled with pop-culture references. The hypocrisy in creativity: The film is a series of tropes. It's Wall-E without the originality or creativity, which made Wall-E universally appreciated.
 
 Why did I watch it? Because a great friend whipped it out on a laptop and I had time. Is that a good enough reason to? Shouldn't I instead have said, "No! It's a going to be terrible Hollywood film which won't lead to any good inquiry."? I'm in a rather passive mode now, and at that time I was quite happy, willing to have some fun.
 
 Surprisingly, it did hark some questions. Awful things sometimes do that. It made me wonder how much knowledge I gained from media during my high school and college years, as opposed to knowledge from real experience. Are the two different? Is it okay to be de-sensitized of one or the other?
 
 Perhaps it's okay for children to eat up as much media possible, as it's more accessible knowledge. Let those kids eat up every bit of [good] media imaginable. It's a time of learning. I feel that I learned so much from those great films I that became accessible once Netflix came out.
 
 Does America consume more media than the rest of the world? Especially compared to social nations such as those in South East Asia and Taiwan?
 
 I've recently been struggling from going from experiencing life to experiencing media. Hating it. Finding programming lifeless, unsocial, neither fun nor insightful, trying to use media while programming to make it more fun, failing. Furthermore poor media is failing too. Any form of passive art is failing to entice me.
 
 If one consumes media as opposed to life, one's own art reflects it. Experiencing the Lego movie is unsettling from a Taiwanese person's standpoint, or anyone not exposed to much American media. There's simply too many pop-culture references. I usually associate pop-culture referencing to America. For example, Das Racist, although I really enjoyed while I was in New York, is an example of abusing pop culture referencing.
 
 If one wants to make art, shouldn't one just live in a place that offers more life experience, a place with real life distractions?
 
 In an older post I asked, How do people gain knowledge in an office environment? Is it all lifeless decisions, music-trance work?
 
 Lastly, what does New York offer that the world does not? Creative people that have fun while creating, that socialize, experience, design during the day and work at night. I believe, New York, will provide the most diverse people, and therefore more diverse projects.
 
 But every city is linked to wealth.
 
 Why don't I feel the same way in Taipei? Or anywhere else? I never encountered as many great, crazy, hypomanic, creative, fun minds as I did in New York, and that's what gives me energy -- those extroverted (or introverted with extrovert characteristics) people. The energy they exude, through events, art, and conversation.
 
 What's the way out? Business! A hostel, cafe, farm, real estate, whatever. Business for money and art for art. It's stupid to mix the two.
 
 So, is living in a place with a great amount of external stimuli such as Asia enough? Or should one live in a city, in a cheap place (ethnic enclave), and take advantage of the proximity of talent, yet try to live a simple life?
 
 Perhaps the answer after all is business. First, get the money, to provide for a family, then create great art, as art is higher on the hierarchy of needs.
 
 All one needs is a few good relationships, creative ones, and both would work.
 
 And the failure of the suburbs is that people forget to experience. Art as experience. As I program more, I forget to listen to lectures, think, talk, work in new areas, philosophy. Life passes.

 - write ideas, clearly, with purpose, and prioritize them to find the most meaningful one
 - propose (idea or ideas?) to audience at Parson’s once I get there
 
 2. Summarize what experiences imparted some philosophy in games
 - <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/a-sequential-list-of-times-game-related-experiences-that-affected-me" title="A Sequential List of Times Game-related Experiences that Affected Me">list games and experiences</a>
 - create own manifesto
 - see philosophy's of great game designers
 - see old notes and thoughts I wrote
 
 Life related questions:
 3. Is attending Parson's necessary? Is being in New York necessary? Can I do this on my own outside of a city? Should the money go into business instead? Can $18,000 buy a tea shop in Taiwan? Can I live without much social life? 2058 2014-05-30 17:55:51 2014-05-30 21:55:51 open closed game-philosophy publish 0 0 post 0 Games Philosophy of Game _edit_last 1 A Sequential List of Game Experiences that I Remember http://rahilpatel.com/blog/a-sequential-list-of-game-experiences-that-i-remember Fri, 30 May 2014 22:01:17 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=2060 todo: fix indenting

 Why do I love Tsai Ming Liang's films?
 
 In answering this, I believe I can find what characteristics of aesthetics I personally love.
 
 Because his work is told from a view of a person from the street, a person who has no culture. The perspectives of the lives in his films are rarely shown, especially for such lengths of time. When i am in a state of hypomania, I think about the poor, how they relate to the world, and what they do. When I go to another country there is a layer of alienation brought out by culture: the temples, prayers, customs , food, tv. Culture itself is alien to humans, it's acquired; I always question how it came to be. How did the world come to the way it is. Lines of large apartment buildings in China, hours of commute time, betel nut stands, shopping malls, everything. When travelling through diverse areas, from indigenous to city, I keep questioning these things. In Tsai Ming Liang's films, I feel I am similarly always questioning. Given a slow pace, the low class humans in society, devoid of culture, almost devoid of life, one gets a fresh travelers perspective again. How did the world come to be? What are people doing, and why?
 
 Few films bring about these questions.
 
 During highly active times of travel, including hypomanic times of being entirely irrational, I couldn't stand any form of media because most films assume so much: film cliches, genres, reason films are made, and the most assumed of all: culture. Compared to going outside and actively doing something, only Tsai Ming-Liang was watchable.

 Films replaced most of literature. Though, they are different experiences.
 
 I wonder, what's left of literature? And by literature, I mean fiction.
 
 It seems the only pieces of literature I have are those that are fantastic [magic realism], thought-provoking, and perhaps philosophic.
 
 I guess I will have to wait until I actually try reading some more.

 I've recently changed from an extrovert phase to an introvert one, and I'd like to explore the differences in how one interacts (and learns) for extroverts and introverts.
 
 [stopped post here, poop. I gave it a shot.]
 
 <blockquote>
 People who prefer extraversion draw energy from action: they tend to act, then reflect, then act further. If they are inactive, their motivation tends to decline. To rebuild their energy, extraverts need breaks from time spent in reflection. Conversely, those who prefer introversion expend energy through action: they prefer to reflect, then act, then reflect again. To rebuild their energy, introverts need quiet time alone, away from activity.
 
 The extravert's flow is directed outward toward people and objects, and the introvert's is directed inward toward concepts and ideas. Contrasting characteristics between extraverts and introverts include the following:
 
 Extraverts are action oriented, while introverts are thought oriented.
 Extraverts seek breadth of knowledge and influence, while introverts seek depth of knowledge and influence.
 Extraverts often prefer more frequent interaction, while introverts prefer more substantial interaction.
 Extraverts recharge and get their energy from spending time with people, while introverts recharge and get their energy from spending time alone.
 <cite>Wikipedia, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personality_type#Attitudes:_extraversion_and_Introversion">Personality Type, Attitudes: extraversion and introversion</a></cite>
 </blockquote>
 
 Hmm, well that seems to cover the basis of it.
 
 <blockquote>Extraverts recharge and get their energy from spending time with people</blockquote>
 I normally view thought as inaction and talking to people as action. But both can be either passively (lazily) done or actively done. Though, to me, it feels quite contradictory that talking to something is a passive thing. Or, perhaps, I don't know how to talk to people passively, and am always overly-excited like Socrates, inquiring instead of casually talking, wanting every social interaction a progressive one for me.
 
 Therefore, I also often feel <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/books-passive-media-and-the-internet" title="Books, Passive Media, and The Internet">books are passive</a> and dialog is active.
 
 How people critically think are from two modes: introspection and dialog.
 
 A balance of the two is healthy, but I often fall to the extremes of either.
 
 <blockquote>Extraverts are action oriented, while introverts are thought oriented.</blockquote>

 During much of my time in Asia (Taipei, Taiwan, Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur, Penang, India, and Taipei again) I experienced high anxiety, loss of reality, and unimaginable happiness.
 
 At first, I figured it was simply the effect of weather [link to effects of weather] on dopamine. Clearly high temperature and sunlight affected me. After reading a few articles of Wikipedia, I re-diagnosed this time as mania.
 
 I experienced all of the effects of Mania: extroverted characteristics, pressured speech, racing thoughts, unable to work for long periods of time without external stimuli, ADHD; problems with physiology: sleeping less, more active lifestyle.
 
 During travel in Asia, I'd wake up, rush to figure out what to do, then somewhat execute it, making up trip along the way. Every hour of travel was a new experience, something to consume, extending time [link to time]. I was at awe and wonder throughout, meeting people, exploring, deeply thinking about the things around me (how things have come to be, anthropology, etc.), and thinking about ways for me to produce something from my interactions. 
 
 I didn't talk to people. I extract the information I wanted from them. Or, explored together. I was a monster and information from external sources was my food.
 
 All I had to do was spend time moving around outside, seeing the public for a few hours during the heat and sunlight to satisfy my body. I'd often return to a hostel late at night socialize.
 
 Perhaps in countries I could not interact with locals, I substituted with observing. 2119 2014-07-10 08:27:17 2014-07-10 12:27:17 open closed hypomania publish 0 0 post 0 Personal Schizoid Personality Disorder Thoughts Travel _edit_last 1 Inaction in a Bookshop in Taipei http://rahilpatel.com/blog/inaction-in-a-bookshop-in-taipei Tue, 24 Jun 2014 19:39:53 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=2128 After a very active traveling life, I took a programming contract that altered me into a more passive person, or, active, but with non-humans. When I finished, I went to a nearby popular 24-hour bookstore a few times.
 
 I was reading western philosophy at 3am, when, suddenly, I hear odd shrieks and thumping sounds, clearly a person suffering.
 
 I go up to the person, find a bum shaking on the floor. I tell one person to call the cops (I'm in Taiwan, and that's when I realized I didn't know Taiwan's emergency number). Soon, the bum started bleeding from the mouth, so I told the other person to help me get the bum to sit against the wall, so the person wouldn't choke on his own blood. I was quite unsure what to do next. I froze a bit, then decided to search for anyone who seemed knowledgeable. As soon as I made that decision, finally, a person voluntarily came to help, a store employee, examined the bums mouth, figured the bum just bit his tongue, ingeniously stuck a pen between his teeth. A little later, the medics came (Taiwan's emergency services is are amazing).
 
 It terrible that I did not know how to further handle the situation, other then getting others to help, but it is more terrible that only one other person helped.
 
 Out of the 20 or so people in that bookstore within audible distance, only one came on time, one came late, just before the medics did, and throughout the rest of the time, no one even came to see what was going on.
 
 It was frightening. Not the bum bleeding, but the lack of action. Immediately, I felt <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/reading-is-often-actionless">reading is absolutely actionless</a> and hoped to never do work that makes me passive again, afraid I would turn into one of those 20 or so people.
 
 This is simply an instance of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bystander_effect">bystander effect</a>, which is even more plentiful in the suburbs with car accidents, but the time of it, with me going from an active to passive phase, made the situation highly contemplative. 2128 2014-06-24 15:39:53 2014-06-24 19:39:53 open closed inaction-in-a-bookshop-in-taipei publish 0 0 post 0 Action Philosophy _edit_last 1 An Attempt to Write Everything I Know http://rahilpatel.com/blog/an-attempt-to-write-everything-i-know Fri, 27 Jun 2014 21:11:19 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=2134 隨機字條：因為寫不是創造的，我也會第一次用中文寫什麼都東西。
 
 兩個月以前我開始設計程式的合同。那時候跟一點以前我做者聽哲學（Great Ideas of Philosophy, 2nd Edition by The Great Courses)。對我說來，我覺得有興趣。我天天聽了很少，只有一到二個演講，我覺得那多少夠了，對我想出來比較多。到那時候我不知道哲學是什麼。只有什麼東西有的學生學。
 
 高中學校以來我總是寫我想出來什麼。我寫了什麼都東西。我感覺我寫了什麼是哲學的調查。
 
 工作的時候我從好動改變消極，合理，不著經歷，沒經歷。所以我決定了我應該寫我知道什麼都。
 
 可是我回來臺北的時候我馬上去附近的書店看哲學的書飯寫。我讀了「西方的哲學」被Bertrand Russell，一點讀別的書，讀Wikipedia。我覺得哲學的歷史很有興趣，尤其很少人好像我：Ludwig Wittgenstein，Francis Bacon，Søren Aabye Kierkegaard，可能John Dewey。
 
 可是我覺得我讀了因為我現在比較懶。我感覺不見哲學對人比較好，理由好像理由我覺得不見藝術比較對人好：如果我讀別的人的書，我的心地好可能狹窄。所以我決定了我得聽讀書，只用我自己的字條寫。寫我怎麼了解什麼都東西。 2134 2014-06-27 17:11:19 2014-06-27 21:11:19 open closed an-attempt-to-write-everything-i-know publish 0 0 post 0 Personal _edit_last 1 Why read the Western philosophy canon? http://rahilpatel.com/blog/why-read-the-western-philosophy-canon Sat, 05 Jul 2014 12:08:01 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=2146 TODO: translate to Chinese!

 <a id="Personal-History">Personal History</a>:
 Before recently, I didn't know what philosophy even meant. To my knowledge it was old people pondering about "Is there life?", "What is the meaning of life?", "What is reality?", etc. I've come to learn that's a small part of it.
 
 I recently started listening to a course from The Great Courses: The Great Ideas of Philosophy. With active listening I started with Wittgenstein, Turing, etc, things I found fascinating.
 
 As I had more work, I became more passive, and I ended up listening to most of the 60-part series of lectures, with far less vigor. I imagine if I were as active as I was before the job, I wouldn't have gave it my time, but a the job slowed my brain down, and I was able to spoon-feed myself.
 
 When I completed the job, I went to Taipei, stumbled upon a 24-hour bookstore nearby my new apartment, and found a section on Western Philosophy. In it, I found Bertrand Russell's History of Philosophy. I read most of Russell's History of Western Philosophy, and skimmed most of the other books, figuring out which I liked reading and felt there was much to learn from: Aristotle's work (in one volume really well prefaced by Richard McKeon), Wittgenstein's Tractacus and Philosophical Investigations, Francis Bacon's Essays, and bunch of Bertrand Russell's essays.
 
 <a id="What-was-gained">What was gained</a>:
 Before listening to the rest of the lecture series, I felt that listening to anything old did not make sense. Why not just use Wikipedia and get an answer that is up to current scientific findings? Current knowledge in neurology and psychology can discard many philosophies. There's no reason to read outdated philosophies. Although I still agree in many ways -- I don't value reading about epistemology, logic (understanding it and it's value is enough for me as of now; An aside: It's a pity I was taught logic in my computer science undergraduate but only vaguely remember memorizing the system to prove things without reason), and metaphysics --, as I listened to the rest of the series, I found other values.
 
 Those other values: the joy of reading [Western] history and understanding why things happened (the role of Christianity, reasons empires rise and fall, why witch hunts existed, etc.), the joy of reading the biographies of great people (see how different personalities of great minds spend their lives), understanding their mindset and methods and approach to philosophy and how they made discoveries during their time (I thought The Great Courses lectures nailed this), helping organize knowledge (Aristotle) and helping organize history (both lectures and books are sequential), and ethics and political philosophy (both of which are branches that will never become obsolete, and both of which I feel I could learn something from all the way back to Aristotle).
 
 I still have not delved deep into any particular philosophies, but if I were to, I'd probably read more ethics (especially Aristotle, and essays by Russell and Bacon), political philosophy (I was recommended Machiavelli), politics in history (this is probably considered history not philosophy though), and keep Philosophical Investigations as a general book for inquiry and fun knowing that empiricism, not books, is my preferred method.
 
 <a id="Why">Why?</a>:
 In addition to previously mentioned values, I've gained interests in fields I had no previous interest in, which may be the greatest reason why one should read it: to build interest in philosophy and its infinite surrounding subjects to further gain knowledge and understanding. 2146 2014-07-05 08:08:01 2014-07-05 12:08:01 open closed why-read-the-western-philosophy-canon publish 0 0 post 0 Literature Philosophy _edit_last 1 Conciseness in Art http://rahilpatel.com/blog/conciseness-in-art Sun, 06 Jul 2014 04:20:37 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=2163 [Witten while quite drunk after a KTV party. Todo: Needs more work.]
 
 Purpose: Conciseness in art is key to contemplation and creativity.
 
 Some of my favorite art, ones that I feel deserve the time of it's length, are concise.
 
 Literature:
 In single chapter of Invisible Cities by Italo Calvino, I feel satisfied. I consumed enough to trigger my brain to begin contemplating, creating, mixing in with my own thoughts. The power of literature is not in detail, but in imagination.
 
 If imagination is not the goal, I still feel conciseness is powerful. In Francis Bacon's Essays, more about ethics is told in few words. Likewise in Borjes's Ficciones, the stories are told only to display its mechanics; Although, even Borjes wastes space and uses many references.
 
 Film:
 Film is a medium of visuals, not words. Motion is key.
 
 Wong-Kar Wai's film's dialogue is condensed to poetry. Visuals and poetry. The characters don't speak with social realism, yet it maintains the beauty, because the beautiful visuals and body motion provided by Chris.
 
 Tsai-Ming Liang's films have little to no dialogue, yet, it retains all the power, even enhanced by the lack of language: a distraction.
 
 Games (and interactive art):
 If films can be made without language, so can the medium above it: games. Each game is a language. One interacts with the rules of a game; the grammar.
 
 As proved simply and humbly by Passage by Rohrer, or, with the thrill provided by large scale, Shadow of the Colossus, games do away with language. Furthermore, as proved with playground games, games do not need visual. Just rules. The beauty of games lies neither in language or visual, but with rules. Johann Sebastian Joust is exemplary. Visuals and sounds are supplementary, and often, unnecessary.
 
 New Media:
 Simply finding ways to interact is often enough. [need to think more]
 
 Public Art:
 Quite different, in that it's not distributable, but still, conciseness still persists.
 
 Banksy figured out with stencils that it isn't the skill of a painting, that even a stencil will do. Instead it's the image, place, and statement. A simple stencil of a rat in the right place is enough.
 
 In a life of constant action, efficiency [todo: link to efficiency post] is key. But that's digressing more toward a philosophy of life as am creator rather than a critique of work.
 
 Performance:

 Art as Experience:

 In the information age, what should be written?
 
 The Humanities and Sciences:
 This is what should be written, mostly in the form of essays, or concise prose, like Wittgenstein, or if one had talent, Bacon and Montaigne. Without much skill one likely cannot defeat the past writers in humanities (thinking fundamental ethics and political science), and without much research one likely cannot defeat current writers in sciences. Instead it may be best to mix the fundamentals with a modern context, especially those one has deep knowledge in. For me that is: aesthetics (new media, games), current anthropology (travels), psychology (my own), education (my own), and trans-disciplinary thoughts (what I understand from empiricism).
 
 Literature of artistic merit:
 Contemporary prose and poetry. Nobel Prize for Literature winners are good examples. But, this is an very old medium, where much has been explored for thousands of years. I would not dare go this route, although, I feel it would be fun to write something mind-expanding or mechanical not dislike Calvino and Borges. I have read very little, and plan to keep it that way, in favor of newer media.
 
 Other reasons:
 There's probably more good reasons (not practice or traditional blogs), like journalism.
 
 My method:
 I feel the best way is to use my own journal and try to understand my largely empirical history through inquiry and deduction. To do this I think it's best to <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/the-purpose-of-a-blog-a-medium-for-essays-and-self-assessments">organize all thoughts into one digital form a la this blog</a>. Perhaps keep a page of links to things that I still don't understand, to always know what requires more inquiry. Once I understand everything, I should stop writing, and live more.
 
 There is a problem though. I haven't figured out <a href="how-and-when-to-write-and-the-impossibility-of-a-solitary-life">how to write</a>, at least, a substantial amount, consistently. 2180 2014-07-07 15:28:58 2014-07-07 19:28:58 open closed what-is-worth-writing publish 0 0 post 0 Literature Philosophy _edit_last 1 In Praise of Experimental Art Communities http://rahilpatel.com/blog/in-praise-of-experimental-art-communities Tue, 08 Jul 2014 14:13:09 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=2187 [Old draft, just posting.]
 
 Every little place where people are building communities and exploring should be praised.
 
 Amazing things are being done every moment, rarely documented, because people are taking action, experimenting every day, resulting in great ideas, going unknown, unrewarded.
 
 The problem is how to document (for knowledge and the sake of history), organize, and award where it's due? The community is too active to do such chores. Society is always behind on ideas. Books are always few years behind reality in small spaces of cities. Newer medias, internet videos proliferate knowledge, but to only those in the know, and furthermore it can be quite difficult for anyone outside to grasp it in context of history.
 
 If new thoughts and works should be left to the artists who live on categorical imperative, and the documentation of them to academia, the gap persists. 2187 2014-07-08 10:13:09 2014-07-08 14:13:09 open closed in-praise-of-experimental-art-communities publish 0 0 post 0 Art Social Philosophy _edit_last 1 The Purpose of a Blog: A Medium for Essays and Self-Assessments http://rahilpatel.com/blog/the-purpose-of-a-blog-a-medium-for-essays-and-self-assessments Wed, 16 Jul 2014 17:01:54 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=2201 TODO: translate to Chinese
 
 In the <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/why-have-a-personal-blog">first post of this blog</a>, I question and answer why having one. I am now further specifying the purpose of this blog.
 
 Everything starts with my thoughts, which are recorded in my journal. My journal is in the form of a text file I've kept since 10th grade and the Notes application on my iPhone. I've also haphazardly wrote some thoughts on a few notebooks. Although I love writing on physical paper, carrying a bunch of notebooks is undesirable for nomadic travel. Perhaps, I could send them home every so often, but even that would require me to be at home to have access to them. The best way, I've found (which I haven't done yet: I still use Notes) is to use a text editor application that can edit text files on dropbox. If that feels risky, one can always backup the dropbox file themselves every so often.
 
 My journal serves two purposes: history and thoughts.
 
 The blog, I feel, should consist of more organized, readable, thoughts, which I likely wrote during an active time in life, and which perhaps may be transformed into essays. And the history may be examined for <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/a-self-assessment-ii">self-assessment</a> and inquiry.
 
 The medium did not have to be a blog, but I've, over time, come to like Wordpress. There is even an application for it on the iPhone which is very good. For me, it must be digital, mostly because I have a nomadic life. I actually thought a Wikipedia would be best. Perhaps it is; I just never felt Wordpress was bad enough for me to change.
 
 So, the purpose of this blog is to serve as a medium to write essays and to create a historical self-assessment, both for the sake of philosophical inquiry with myself. 2201 2014-07-16 13:01:54 2014-07-16 17:01:54 open closed the-purpose-of-a-blog-a-medium-for-essays-and-self-assessments publish 0 0 post 0 Essays Philosophy _edit_last 1 _wp_old_slug the-blog-as-a-collection-of-essays _wp_old_slug the-purpose-of-a-blog-a-collection-of-essays-and-self-assessments Autonomy of Taiwan http://rahilpatel.com/blog/autonomy-of-taiwan Tue, 01 Jul 2014 19:16:08 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=3199 aka Why I Love Taiwan.
 
 1. With the last [Philosophy and Human Values] lecture ending with apocalypse outcome, I feel the civil unrest of American has a little in common with Taiwan. The difference is Taiwan reacts in solidarity with protests whereas America doesn't. Is this a result of post-modern society, or because White Terror killed many?
 
 2. Taiwan is a single organism. What I love most about Taiwan, and similarly, Southeast nations, and mountain peoples (including Nepal and Northeast India), is solidarity of the community.
 
 These civilizations contain those such basic human characteristics which seem to have disappeared in the Western countries, save in small town America and similar small town feel neighborhoods of large cities. Though nearly all of these nations suffer or have suffered greatly, the peoples seem to have achieved the highest state of ethics. They actually <em>care</em> for others. They will treat you out, or help you, whereas Western concepts of exchange of goods or services have become detached from morality. Basically, they have a heart. They look forward to life, and the simple pleasure in it. It is worth comparing it to Western society and seeing what went wrong [todo, another blog post. Street life and simple pleasure. Time and self-interest. Several generations in one country.].
 
 A nation of solidarity, not the temporary directional kind, leads to autonomy. All of these nations have enough resources to be self-sufficient, no matter what their international relations are. Taiwan takes it further, being a part of the Four Asian Tigers, gaining and efficiently using modern technology. And yet, throughout several political turmoils Taiwan lives on, in a rather good standing compared to the rest of the world in human development.
 
 Solidarity and autonomy are characteristics of an anarchy. In Taiwan, the police are rather complacent, lax on laws -- foreigners run illegal shops, and there isn't much over-enforcement of shallow laws, such as parking tickets, and they hold good morals, never pushing a homeless person out of a park, yet some laws are very strict, such as those on drugs. The hospitals are affordable (I don't know how). NGOs actually hold some power. Universities hold more. It feels as if society is checked by society itself. Everyone knows everything going on (perhaps that giant bulletin board system has a part in this). It feels like a neighborhood on a country level. The result is the greatest achievement in politics: just as the individuals it consists have, the society has a heart too.
 
 3. Do protests work? Why not go further, boycott a KMT business?
 Chomsky says yes and emphasizes methods of activism, which activist organization of Taiwan have done so well, thanks to past experiences, but though with outstanding protest results, did not sway political decisions, or win much praise from foreign countries (perhaps they are busy and content with other imperialistic concerns).

 and writing feels actionless
 cone of learning
 philosophy of action
 
 Or, reading is often passive, merely consumption.
 
 I consider research as action. For example, when one reads a concept of something in Wikipedia.
 
 But I consider reading an entire book a passive experience. What parts of that book were necessary for one's research? Could it have been skimmed? What is lost in skimming?
 
 I feel in skimming (directed reading, action) one maintains their direction. If I were to write a book on a specific part of psychology, only those things that relate to that specific part are necessary.
 
 One has ignore a great amount of knowledge. This is normal [find vocab].
 
 A digression: Outside of books, the brain does this all of the time to rationalize the world.
 
 But what I've come to recently understand, is that, while one does take action efficiently, there is a possibility that, ignoring some knowledge, one actually doesn't an understanding of it, perhaps losing an opportunity to gain foundational long-term knowledge [link to why read the western philosophy canon] or, misunderstands it, and this leads to anti-intellectualism: action without sufficient knowledge.
 
 As a highly empirical person whose read few books, and plans to write more blogs with large generalizations based on my empirical knowledge, I must understand that these are just generalizations, and the understanding is beyond me, and the amount of time to research and make a good argument is something I will likely value less and prioritize less than some other action.
 
 I shall only write what I, up to current knowledge, understand, and live a normal life, without veering it toward research to write a big book to prove it.
 
 Perhaps this is being lazy, but I value and therefore prioritize other actions more because reading does not satisfy [that feeling].

And the argument of reading being at the bottom of the cone of learning] 2143 2014-07-19 17:57:35 2014-07-19 21:57:35 open closed reading-is-often-actionless publish 0 0 post 0 Action Essays Literature Philosophy _edit_last 1 What is Worth Reading? http://rahilpatel.com/blog/what-is-worth-reading Wed, 16 Jul 2014 18:07:32 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=2197 [TODO: translate to Chinese, related to <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/what-is-worth-writing">What is Worth Writing</a>]

 I've read less books than most elementary school children in my lifetime. I was never able to extract as much value per time with enjoyment factored in in books compared to other mediums, and empericism. Wikipedia was enough. Much recently, <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/why-read-the-western-philosophy-canon">I listened to an audiobook of Great Ideas in Philosophy provided by the Great Courses</a>; That was successful. After that, I figured out I had huge gaps in my knowledge, and proceeded to create a list of things I felt could be worth reading (or listening) to.
 
 Non-fiction:
 
 Philosophy:
 - For philosophy
 - <strong>For the organization of knowledge</strong>
 - <strong>For learning how to communicate using human language</strong>
 - <strong>ethics</strong >- ethical treatises by Aristotle, various essays by Bertrand Russell
 - <strong>politics</strong> - The Republic, Politics, The Prince (and other works), and something more modern
 - thought-provoking philosophical writings - Philosophical Investigations
 - Use audiobooks to consume slowly while simultaneously doing something
 
 Natural Sciences:
 - For knowledge of science
 - <strong>For understanding how research works</strong>
 - prefer large historical or trans-discipline pieces that are up to date - Gödel, Escher, Bach; Thinking, Fast and Slow; A Brief[er] History in Time, Big History from The Great Courses, etc. These books compete with online lectures.
 
 - Biographies of great people:
 -- For knowledge
 -- For fun, <strong>for experience</strong> (possibly my favorite reading material, possibly because it's most humane; The same reason applies to coming-of-age films)
 -- Use Wikipedia
 -- Many of the online lectures cover biographies, to allow more insight on their decisions
 -- A single book with multiple biographies is best, to ease the comparison of lives
 
 - Essays by great essayists, and possibly the short writings of other great writers
 -- Experience good writing to help develop one's own writing style
 -- <strong>For knowledge</strong>, and fun (same reasons as biographies of great people)
 
 - Language books
 
 [the following was added two years later]
 - History
 -- <strong>To understand how the world came to be</strong>, especially useful <strong>to see how cultures have developed</strong>
 -- Similar to biographies, a single book with multiple histories of societies is best, to ease the comparison of societies
 -- Can use Wikipedia
 
 <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/the-kinds-of-literature-and-the-extraction-of-ideas">certain kinds of non-fiction literature</a>:
 - anthology
 -- Similar to a single book with multiple biographies or multiple histories, a single book with multiple writings is a much better <strong>experience</strong> than any single book
 -- Similar to History, <strong>to see how cultures have developed</strong>
 -- history of philosophical writings
 -- history of essays
 -- history of literature
 --- all of these should be encompass the world, not just the West
 
 - <strong>reader</strong>
 -- <strong>For ideas</strong>
 -- <em>Penguin Great Ideas</em> series
 -- Readers for knowledge categories: <em>The Media Studies Reader</em>, etc.
 
 
 Fiction:
 - For art
 - Contemporary masterpieces, including comics, especially those of Nobel Prize winners in 
 Literature. Although, I would likely choose other mediums over this, and empiricism over all all art
 
 [the following was added two years later]
 - Magical Realism
 -- <strong>for thought-provocation</strong>
 -- Calvino, Borges, etc.
 
 - Philosophical Fiction
 -- <strong>for thought-provocation</strong>
 
 - Travel Literature
 -- <strong>For fun, for experience</strong> (similar to reading biographies)
 -- Travel Journals
 --- for experience and fun
 -- Travel Guides
 --- for history
 -- Travel Fiction
 --- for experience and fun

 Purpose:
 I feel, that in competitive video games, there is a massive amount of decision-making going at amazing speeds, and somewhere in that time, there are things in psychology, particularly decision-making, where some new knowledge may exist.
 
 What to do:
 Detail advanced, real-time decision making through professional-level competitive games. Write how professionals win. Write it empirically, then scientifically.
 
 Why video games over past games?
 Chess is turn-based. Sports are real-time, but there's a strong emphasis on physical. Video games have physical limits too, but it's less prominent, usually limited to hand-eye coordination.
 
 Is there a reason to examine real-time? What's the difference between decision making in real-time as opposed to turn-based? Time, duh. More decisions are made during a period of time, and, there's not enough time to make the rights ones.

 NEEDS MORE WORK
 
 <h2>Purpose</h2>
 I think there's a huge fallacy with the concept of a home. A place to return to.
 
 <h2>Arguments against</h2>
 Why spend the time to commute to and from home? It's rote, routine. One experiences less, and one is more likely turn to media to procrastinate. One will likely perform less action, make less decisions, be less observant, be less creative, more likely to seek the comfort of home, become complacent, and conspicuously consume, more likely through media rather than the real world.
 
 The idea of physically living away from work, and having to commute to it is silly. Companies should consider if employees need to physically be available, or, is a phone call or video chat enough?
 
 The fact that people are kicked out of public parks for sleeping there in Western countries is crazy.
 
 For me personally, home, whether my parent's house, a shared apartment (especially when my roommates are gone), is and historically has always been the death of action and me.
 
 <h2>Arguments for</h2>
 Temperature regulation, electricity, privacy, security, cooking appliances, etc. and the convenient, permanent package of it all.
 
 The greatest argument, is, perhaps, relationships, family and friends.
 
 But wouldn't it be greater to live with family in friends in a more active lifestyle? Perhaps leading to a more communal lifestyle, not based on family.
 
 <h2>Nomadism</h2>
 But what if a country provided everything in the public? Most developed countries <em>do</em> provide everything necessary to live, quite well, in the public. And some do it well.
 
 I think Taiwan is a model for nomadic living. The cheap food prices akin to developing countries, super convenient convenient stores akin to Japan, and politeness of allowing one to be able to sleep anywhere, as long as one doesn't make a mess.
 
 <h2>A Tangent</h2>
 Nomadism can be seen living off the excesses of the world. Knowing this, one knows that there's enough space in the public to comfortably house all of the homeless.
 
 There's certainly something certainly disturbing with the cost of property, which provokes thoughts of socialism. 2261 2014-07-18 07:24:02 2014-07-18 11:24:02 open closed the-home-fallacy-or-nomadism-is-normal publish 0 0 post 0 Essays Literature _edit_last 1 _wp_old_slug the-home-fallacy-or-nomadism _yoast_wpseo_primary_category _yoast_wpseo_content_score 90 medium_post O:11:"Medium_Post":11:{s:16:"author_image_url";s:74:"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/200/200/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png";s:10:"author_url";s:28:"https://medium.com/@rahil627";s:11:"byline_name";N;s:12:"byline_email";N;s:10:"cross_link";s:2:"no";s:2:"id";s:11:"c24b70a28e3";s:21:"follower_notification";s:3:"yes";s:7:"license";s:19:"all-rights-reserved";s:14:"publication_id";s:12:"7a04709b0155";s:6:"status";s:6:"public";s:3:"url";s:79:"https://medium.com/@rahil627/the-home-fallacy-or-nomadism-is-normal-c24b70a28e3";} How and When to Write, and the Impossibility of a Solitary Life http://rahilpatel.com/blog/how-and-when-to-write-and-the-impossibility-of-a-solitary-life Fri, 18 Jul 2014 17:37:11 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=2269 I've recently lived an extremely practical life, so it is rare I take the time to write. Instead I merely jot thoughts in a journal. Like Nietzsche, I need a life of constant action, of which I only care for suffering, to take meaningful action. I only began writing after a very slow and long transition into a depressing slump. Writing without an audience, without purpose feels like dying; It ignores the world. Perhaps before I even begin writing, I need figure out how and when. How: Perhaps I need to create a suitable environment for it, and that is I'm afraid, being away from the temptation of civilization, and, perhaps, those great writers who wrote in solitude, did so because they had to. I think it is only necessary for very large works. Small works can be rapidly periodically produced over a short period, similar to how Kerouac wrote On The Road, locking himself in the house, writing on a typewriter with one large continuous sheet of paper, while his wife spoon-fed him. Still, I find it so wild that the act of writing, an action, requires one to be in solitude, where inaction often rises. When (and little of What): Why spend time writing at such an age, without achievement, without a mass amount of knowledge, when one could substitute that time for practical things? I feel Montaigne timed his writing correctly, after his public life, in retirement. Perhaps only knowledge currently unknown to the world should be written currently; Perhaps it should be talked about with great people, debated, lectured, finally coming to a point where it should be written for others to see. Perhaps writings based one's own experience can wait. Yet, the only things I feel should be written are based on my experience. Perhaps there <em>are</em> things that should be written at a time. Some knowledge and feeling is temporary. Thoughts change. Writing about what knowledge I currently have may be worth writing. Conclusion: It seems there are two ways and times: while simultaneously taking action (balancing action and inaction) or retirement. 2269 2014-07-18 13:37:11 2014-07-18 17:37:11 open closed how-and-when-to-write-and-the-impossibility-of-a-solitary-life publish 0 0 post 0 Literature _edit_last 1 _wp_old_slug how-and-when-to-write-and-and-the-impossibility-of-a-solitary-life The Obsolescence of Literature and the Future of Education http://rahilpatel.com/blog/the-obsolescence-of-literature-and-the-future-of-education Sat, 19 Jul 2014 20:00:54 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=2294 I grew up with games in younger years, film in high school and early college. During middle school, I read Harry Potter because I needed to pass a book report; It was okay because I was also playing a video game simultaneously. It wasn't until a year or so after college I read a book. I read two: Watchmen and Invisible Cities. One isn't even a book, it's a comic book! 
 
 When I read Invisible Cities, it made me think. No other book had done that for me previously. Furthermore, it aided me during creative times.
 
 Watchmen had great insight into psychology and philosophy (which I didn't know the terms at the time), and used the medium in unique ways.
 
 So, that left one book and one comic book until the age of 27, after listening to a philosophy lectures series, I found myself in the Western philosophy section of a book store reading away. What a weird experience: to read books.
 
 I was recently going over what I felt would be a <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/a-liberal-arts-self-study-curriculum">liberal arts education</a> through media, books being the main thing to catch up on. After going through some, I confirmed some old beliefs, notably: books <em>are</em> dead.
 
 In literature there is less content per time. In film, the mind takes it all in. The detail is infinite. If "a picture tells a thousand words" then a film tells millions. This is why I never read books with lengthy descriptions of things; I don't want to read about how a bedpost appears. The ideas are conveyed equally in films, just faster.
 
 I found no reason to read any piece of classical literature. They take place in older societies which make it harder to relate, most don't try to portray reality (save for realism which came much later), and for the most part cover really basic ideas shallowly. They are lengthy fairy tales.
 
 Books may have been the way ideas got around in the past, but we now have better media, including Wikipedia, to turn the media back into words.
 
 That's where books can be useful, not literature, but non-fiction books which contain dialog that mix several ideas. I found books like A New History of Philosophy by Anthony Kenny, Bertrand Russell's essays, Understanding Power by Noam Chomsky, The Great Conversation by Mortimer Adler, What Technology Wants by Kevin Kelly, Debt: The First 5000 Years, The Life and Death of Great American Cities, all quite useful in organizing my experiences into words and their places in the sciences or humanities.
 
 With brevity of art mediums also comes a time after experience, where the mind works, where creativity and will are pushed. The more potent the experience, the more likely one will take action. Though this is not the best way to go about making things, it's not bad, as many have proved with Invisible Cities. And of my opinion, it is often better to take action than not (assuming some rational).
 
 As media evolves literature becomes more obsolete. I could probably create a curriculum of contemporary films that contain the same ideas that books did which take a fraction of time to consume, and one can better relate to because they take place in recent times. I could also suggest a curriculum of occupations, travels, and hobbies to an individual who would then experience those ideas. Still, I hope in the future that a curriculum of games could be made; That would simultaneously make education feasible and a real experience. 2294 2014-07-19 16:00:54 2014-07-19 20:00:54 open closed the-obsolescence-of-literature-and-the-future-of-education publish 0 0 post 0 Essays Literature _wp_old_slug the-obsolescence-of-literature _edit_last 1 _wp_old_slug films-versus-literature Traditional Music Games http://rahilpatel.com/blog/traditional-music-games Thu, 18 Sep 2014 09:24:20 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=2319 Connect Taiko No Tatsujin to tablas using Makey Makey at a Gurudwara.

 Thoughts:
 Foreigners will have to go to a Gurudwara, take off their shoes, perhaps pray, then play. Perhaps kids who play it will be inspired to learn to play traditional instruments.

 Perhaps can think of other traditional instrument, game, and place of worship combinations.

 A neat way design new media (which may be in the form of a game) is to think of the input and the output, based on the perceptions of humans.
 
 I used this strategy in the past for games, where I'd think about all of the inputs the medium has, often an iPad, then create games using them. However, it only dawned to me during the lecture that data is not limited to mediums. Everything is data. In and out.

 Anything that is public has an enabling effect. People can freely enter that area, use it however they like. This creates a feeling of freedom, allowing people to do work and feel proud of it.
 
 Being physically near is different from interacting online, or through media.
 
 It’s more likely to result in action, because, it's social.
 
 <h2>My history with public places</h2>
 In the neighborhood I grew up in, I'd explore it and nearby neighborhoods by biking. Nature should be every child's first public place. I had friends on my street and in my neighborhood. We would bike together and to each others' houses.
 
 During school, there would be breaks during lunch and recess. There would always be a place where people would meet and hang out.
 
 In college there was a public room called "the retro room" (todo: deserves it's own blog). It mostly contained nerdy types because there were always TVs with video games hooked up. People would talk, play, read, work, eat, and sleep there.
 
 After I moved to a rich neighborhood, I struggled and used media. Media is a one way interaction. I left it when I left the suburbs. From then on, I physically attended public places.
 
 In SF, I would explore neighborhoods, attend free museum days, and attend free art events. I used public libraries (including UCSF library) and cafes and parks as regular places to do computer work. I also just generally spent a lot of time in transit: walking, running, on the 38, and on the Caltrain when I had my first job.
 
 During this time, I gained knowledge in art aesthetic, physical space, people, but I lacked knowledge in their creative process, personal life, work life.
 
 In New York, I explored again for nearly a month, in search of places to live. Later, I'd explore the ethnic enclaves. I used public transportation liberally. I began by volunteering for a public organization and voluntarily interning, seeing how artists work. Again, there were free art events -- lectures by NYU, comedy at the Upright Citizen's Brigade and Hannibal's place, free events on The Skint. For work, I mostly spent time at Pratt Institute's library.
 
 I saw how film was made, how an organization was run. I continued exploring, but only what can be seen in the public, from the streets. I can see where capitalism is high or low, and where ethnic enclaves sustain a better life. Through game jams I made friends for game development.
 
 During my travels I'd start at a hostel, I'd almost consider as a public place, some even allow you to enter the common room without sleeping there. Then I'd go explore the artificial and nature, all accessible to the public. I'd volunteer at places where anyone was allowed to (why anyone pays to volunteer is crazy).
 
 What was a public space blurred with what was space. At some point, it didn't matter where I was. There was no reason to be in a cafe to use the computer, or a building, or on a chair. If I needed to use the computer I'd just whip out my laptop wherever I was (street, transit, nature), tether to a cheap 3G, and use the computer! I'd never spend any time in a residential or office building, just outside or in a public place, consuming the public, or in proximity of friends, maximizing time with friends and the public. Common rooms of hostel, parks, near street food, near points of interest, transport were common.
 
 In East Asia, it didn't matter where I slept; There's no crime there. I'd sleep when I was tired, or at a friend's house, or at a park. It cut commute time.
 
 In Taiwan, it didn't matter where I ate. The food was cheap enough to eat anywhere. There was no reason to go home. I could eat, sleep, work, anywhere. Absolute freedom.
 
 <h2>Public Places as a Savior from Commoditization</h2>
 Public places in cities I think are closely associated to freedom. The sense of freedom gets lost in social norms of the artificial. People are conditioned to sleep at home, cook and eat at home, work in offices, and work more at home or at a cafe, leaving bars as the only place to socialize. This is the result of commoditization, people feel (and often do) that they have to pay to use a computer, pay to rent a book or dvd, pay to sleep, pay a cafe to use the internet, pay to park, pay to sleep, pay to travel, pay to pitch a tent, pay to drink water, pay to wash clothes. Without a healthy street life, worse, in the suburbs, it's possible that people live without knowing they could actually meet friends at a park, have a barbecue, and enjoy.
 
 <h2>Public Places have Common Values</h2>
 The people that show up in an arcade, a free museum, a park, an outdoor public performance are of the same. In negative light, freeloaders. In positive, curious, wanting an experience, with people. It's publicly accessible, open to all people, especially, when in a city (for transport accessibility).
 
 Because of those traits in the place itself, the people who attend have certain common values (mentioned in the video): free, open to all people (age, color, sex, whatever). A great portion of the people who come to these events turn out to be quite altruistic themselves, willing to spend time, share skills, socialize with anyone.
 
 Public places are an option that's open, a stimulus. "Humans are by nature political animals", and when there is a choice between spending time at home or with people in a public place, it's likely the latter.
 
 <h2>Public Spaces</h2>
 Public spaces are little different. It's a more active place, a space where one can fill it in with whatever they like. The intention isn't to merely consume, but to interact, with people and things. A public space is where anyone can volunteer, pitch and run an event. That's very powerful, and requires creativity, artists. These often come in the form of DIY spaces, open mics at cafes or bars, music jams, game jams, and other forms of improvisational creation.
 
 San Francisco's ATA, New York's spaces in Bushwick and Williamsburg, cafes across Asia, hackerspaces around the world.
 
 In the video, it's mentioned spaces allow freedom to create work and feel proud of it. For people to feel good, does there need to be a feeling of freedom to create any work? Or does it require a social aspect, to collaborate with others, to create work?* (THINK MORE)
 
 Also in the video, when spaces interact with other spaces, it creates a community of spaces.
 
 Also in the video, when spaces interact with institutions, the aforementioned values have to be fought for.
 
 The value of these places, perhaps, will require another blog post at another time.

 I've recently felt I've lacked knowledge in liberal arts. People around me have libraries of books. I have nothing. They're able to speak lucidly about certain subjects referencing a common history, whereas I base my knowledge entirely on personal experiences. I have little knowledge in the domain of history (and how knowledge developed historically to affect the present). Though this doesn't mean I dislike my empirical education, nor do I care to listen to dead old white dudes, rather, I just want to verify some thoughts to better organize all of the thoughts I've empirically gathered over the past 5 years.
 
 After a recent <a title="A Personal Journey through Books" href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/a-personal-journey-through-books">personal journey through books</a>, the list has been updated accordingly.
 
 <h2>Curriculums</h2>
 I see two.
 
 1. Media, which is covered below. In general, contemporary museums for aesthetics, films for humanities, TV documentaries for natural sciences, books for history, philosophy, and science. As always, supplied with Wikipedia and life.
 
 2. MIT offers several (nearly all?) through the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenCourseWare">OpenCourseWare</a> program. They <a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm">offer</a> substantially more than other colleges that have this program. They even provide <a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mit-curriculum-guide/">curriculum guides</a>. I've just learned about the curriculum part 5 minutes ago and am now thinking about changing to this. [TODO: BRB!]
 
 <h2>Mediums</h2>
 <h3><a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a></h3>
 The current greatest gift to humans.
 
 <h3>Contemporary Museums</h3>
 Unfortunately modern contemporary museums only exists in cities. I guess more progressive art websites work as well, such as Yale's fine arts. For technology and art, there's MIT Media Lab, NYU ITP, Parsons D&amp;T, and so on.
 
 Consuming these will likely cause one's mind to skip to current aesthetics, likely finding any older medium aesthetically outdated.
 
 Consuming these will also just provide pleasure and perhaps lead to discover new things. If an art object contains a criticism of society, one might be interested in figuring out how society came to be. In this way, they wake people up from "dogmatic slumber", in an aesthetically current way.
 
 <h3>Films</h3>
 I grew up with films as being part of my formative years, but now it's less forming. It seems the aforementioned BBC documentaries defeat films for longer forms of content. One would have to just select whatever film or documentary that related to their current research.
 
 I've found Kevin Kelly keeps a list of "<a href="http://truefilms.com/">true films</a>" which he states:
 <blockquote>"I present here the best general interest true films I've found. I define true films as documentaries, educational films, instructional how-to's, and what the British call factuals - a non-fiction visual account."</blockquote>
 One can find BBC's Ascent of Man, A Blank on the Map, Grizzly Man, Baraka, and a slew of other things. He writes a small note about each one which is really helpful.
 
 I've recently personally been going over the winners of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prize_of_the_Ecumenical_Jury">Prize of the Ecumenical Jury</a>, and often the director's other films, though, their aim is more philosophical, really getting at human nature. The last two films I saw connected to the Algerian War in two very different ways. Though these films do not provide an ordered source of education, I still feel there's a lot to learn with every film, and which may spark interest or gestalts because the films themselves are so damn aesthetically pleasing. Just the last film alone makes me want to watch that old Algerian War film about guerrilla warfare, learn why French Revolution was so bad, read a biography on Rimbaud, and figure out why racism still exists in France and the US.
 
 Though a general list of the greatest films ever, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sight_%26_Sound">BFI's Sight & Sound polls</a> for films (separate polls by critics and by filmmakers) and documentaries can serve as good sources of knowledge too. Unlike the ecumenical jury prize, there is no specific aim at human nature, but unsurprisingly, the best films aim for just that. I found the documentaries to be a better source than the films, where the film Shoah will take you to the reality of World War II, and where Patricio Guzman and Chris Marker cover much of the revolutionary air with Battle of Chile and Marker's oeuvre.
 
 <h3>TV Documentaries</h3>
 Books are dull. I was reading a more modern one, What Technology Wants, and though it's disjointed, I enjoyed a lot of it. In many chapters it connects technology with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_History">Big History</a> (including science and history, cosmos and cosmic evolution). This lead to lots of Wikipedia'ing, and eventually coming to some old BBC science TV documentary series. Though Columbia has a "Frontiers of Science" course, I've found these shows provide a great amount of information that still is scientifically correct, and can still serve as a good core and starting point for anyone. The great thing about these documentaries is that many actually do go over a Big History which provides a cohesive history and science (all of the sciences!). The top three that cover a big history are Connections, Cosmos, and The Ascent of Man. All three are brilliant mostly because they are presented by such caring presenters with such beautiful personalities.
 
 Here's a list I've gathered:
 - Connections* - James Burke, history of science and technology
 - Cosmos* - Carl Sagan, cosmos, astrology
 - The Ascent of Man* - Jacob Brownowski, science, second, focus from migration / agriculture to world war two
 - Civilisation* - Kenneth Clark, art, first, from dark ages to modern 1969,
 - The Day The Universe Changed** - James Burke, more philosophical take of the history of science and technology
 - Life on Earth, The Living Planet, Trials of Life, Life, Planet Earth - David Attenborough’s main series of Earth
 - The Real Thing - James Burke, human perception
 - The Shock of the New - art up to modernism
 - World at War* - world war II, documentary more so than BBC style presentation
 - America - third, from 1500 to 1972
 - The Cell - ?
 
 Some of these can be found online on YouTube. If not, one can pirate, or try to get one on half.com to build an amazing library for a child.
 
 <h3>Books</h3>
 The most relevant and current source in philosophy I know is <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/wiki/readinglist">Reddit's philosophy reading</a> list. It categorizes all current knowledge of philosophy and provides the current standards of books, essays, and articles for each. In it, it constantly references, for good reason, <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/">Stanford's encyclopedia of philosophy</a>. And, of course, there's also the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy">wikipedia article on philosophy</a>.
 
 A good source for modern science books is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Society_Prizes_for_Science_Books">The Royal Society Prizes for Books</a>. This is where popular cohesive history books like A Short History of Nearly Everything, The Information, and books by Jared Diamond and Steven Hawking exist.
 
 A rather outdated source for philosophy is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Books"> Great Books</a>. It's a method of learning through books. It's traditional, euro-centric, going through the Western Canon, more philosophy and science oriented than other similar book series, but outdated and exhaustive, especially in a time with more current medias replacing most of the content in fraction of time in a more aesthetically pleasing manner. The most well known <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curriculum#Core_curriculum"> core curriculum</a> based off of the Great Books idea are University of Chicago's and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_Curriculum_(Columbia_College)">Columbia College's</a>, something all student's must partake during their first year. On Columbia College's <a href="http://www.college.columbia.edu/core/core">website</a>, a current syllabus is available for Contemporary Civilization (mainly philosophy that are still relevant -- epistemology, ethics, social sciences) and Literature Humanities, both of which contain all of the readings and exact textbooks in sequential order, but unfortunately does not specifically show all of the selections of texts, or provide any materials. In addition to those two supposed year-long courses, there's semester-long arts, music, writing, science, and frontiers of science. Of them, only two, arts and frontiers of science, have the some materials available online, but even then, they are missing lectures.
 
 My greatest concern is philosophy, so the Contemporary Civilization syllabus is a perfect fit for me. To supplement the readings, one can use <a href="http://www.thegreatcourses.com/">The Great Courses</a> lectures and questions (nearly all can be pirated), after each reading. I personally did not care for literature humanities and would even say that films replace them easily. Their music and art syllabus can be completed in a day each just by experiencing the arts. I have not tried the frontiers of science, but it could be good if one doesn't feel that their knowledge in science is cohesive enough, but again, the BBC TV Series probably do a better job at presenting this.
 
 Actually getting access to the books is quite cumbersome, even in the information age, which is a pity. It seems, going to the library still may be one of the best ways. If one prefers actual books at their own abode, then online bookstores are the way. <a title="eBooks" href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/ebooks">eBooks are still quite an odd experience, but there <em>is</em> a good application for it</a>. Googling the book name and "epub" or "pdf" is a pretty good way of getting most of the classics through free libraries such as Project Gutenberg. <a href="http://prodigalnomore.wordpress.com/great-books-of-the-western-world-as-free-ebooks/">Someone even took the time to link the Great Books to free online resources</a>. Otherwise, one has to pirate modern books. Currently, nearly every book can be pirated through <a href="http://gen.lib.rus.ec/">Library Genesis</a>. 2379 2014-09-19 06:56:31 2014-09-19 10:56:31 open closed a-liberal-arts-self-study-curriculum publish 0 0 post 0 Philosophy of Education _oembed_57bc2237a9727de87c41077bb6fa708f {{unknown}} _oembed_9e14f5b11224c4a80982f46b2a3ce99e {{unknown}} _oembed_833312e1607802645aa52f93238a60e3 {{unknown}} _edit_last 1 _oembed_4a8736f31144f5eb3b5eb60751539d40 {{unknown}} medium_post O:11:"Medium_Post":11:{s:16:"author_image_url";s:74:"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/200/200/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png";s:10:"author_url";s:28:"https://medium.com/@rahil627";s:11:"byline_name";N;s:12:"byline_email";N;s:10:"cross_link";s:2:"no";s:2:"id";s:12:"68125860b6bf";s:21:"follower_notification";s:3:"yes";s:7:"license";s:19:"all-rights-reserved";s:14:"publication_id";s:2:"-1";s:6:"status";s:6:"public";s:3:"url";s:78:"https://medium.com/@rahil627/a-liberal-arts-self-study-curriculum-68125860b6bf";} _yoast_wpseo_primary_category Banksy: Animated http://rahilpatel.com/blog/banksy-animated Sat, 20 Sep 2014 07:27:27 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=2389 It would be fun to animate Banksy's art, and have them interact with the public.

 I value action over words, the time of inscribing over a medium, as opposed to experiencing or thinking of something else is a waste, unless one can simultaneously do both.
 
 Although I value action over words, now is the first time in my life that I’d like to verify my thoughts, many of which have never formed into words, and unfortunately, the fastest way to transform a thought into a medium is language.
 
 I believe verbal language is inferior to visual in its efficiency to transmit knowledge and ideas.
 
 A more efficient, progressive manner of gaining knowledge and taking action would be to live and act simultaneously, taking the highest order of action one is able. In fine artists, especially the more progressive kinds [thinking Fluxus], I feel to some extent they live in this manner.
 
 Many professions in the modern world separate life and action. If one works on a computer in an office, perhaps the only action one can take is to listen to something. Often music, but audiobooks are possible too. If one is writing, one is often in some kind of room that doesn't offer much in terms of experience.
 
 My entire post-college past has been to do both, live and act. To do computer work on a train, to write during a protest, to eat while teaching, to sleep on a bus.
 
 The goal in life often said is "to love your work". The goal in life should be to live and work. In the former, work is conceived as something someone does at a time separately from life, whereas the latter is doing both simultaneously. 2490 2014-09-22 08:12:45 2014-09-22 12:12:45 open closed life-and-action publish 0 0 post 0 Ethics _edit_last 1 A Personal Journey through Books http://rahilpatel.com/blog/a-personal-journey-through-books Sat, 20 Sep 2014 05:52:33 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=3586 aka how do books work?
 
 In some past blogs posts, like <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/the-obsolescence-of-literature-and-the-future-of-education">this one</a>, I basically claim books are dead, or at the least the last form one should get knowledge from. And after embarking on this quest through books, I almost confirmed that idea.
 
 These great books curriculums vanished for good reason. At first, I thought they would be interesting because through a The Great Courses course on The Great Ideas in Philosophy I found many of the ideas interesting, mostly because the professor lectured well. There was a bit of history, biography, chronological ordering, and new thoughts [to me] from Wittgenstein, Kant. For the most part it was just consolidating past thoughts into terms. It was also fun to see how knowledge came about through the history of time, without the internet.
 
 After listening to the lecture series I went into a 24 hour book shop in Taiwan, found a Western Philosophy section, one of the few sections in English. Using a History on Philosophy by Bertrand Russell, I joyously went through some Aristotle, Bacon's Essays (my first set of Essays), some essays by Bertrand Russell, the last book of a New History of Philosophy by Anthony Kenny, and skimmed many other books.
 
 Again, similar to the lecture series, the books were fun to see how knowledge accumulated through books, how knowledge forms in general, how civilization took the wrong direction at times, how religions form, how education and of poor knowledge had bad consequences, how people would try to make ultimate ideologies of ways to live life, why people make art, reading biographies -- to see the actions they took, their personalities, comparing it to my own; getting some history in along the way, how societies collapse, and at the beginning consolidating ideas into philosophic terms or sciences. I would read some of History of Philosophy, check Wikipedia for things that interested me, read a bunch of related links, and move on. That was fun, lots of brain stimulation. Many things related to my thoughts at the time.
 
 When I arrived to my parent's house in suburban America, I figured I would be interested in some of the philosophy books, especially those mentioned in the Core Curriculum by Columbia. It turns out, that wasn't so fun. The books are dry, repeat knowledge, and repeat ideas one's already been exposed to through other medias or life. I would say only a handful from Contemporary Civilization are useful; Most of the content is useless including all of the religious texts, and all literature from Literature Humanities, aesthetically and philosophically. Wikipedia provides a better history of art. BBC documentaries provide a better way of teaching science and history. <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/wiki/readinglist">Reddit Reading List</a> provides a modern list of books to read for philosophy (epistemology, ethics, politics, and even cognitive science). And in general, it's just doesn't feel as creative-inducing as simply walking around a city and thinking. All of this lead to me updating <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/a-liberal-arts-self-study-curriculum" title="A Liberal Arts Self Study Curriculum">the liberal arts self study curriculum</a> I had first created.
 
 Instead of reading a series of books it seems the path I took in that book shop in Taipei was a good way of learning how books work. There's no reason to read most of the books entirely. Just go in a bookstore and have fun. I hope to complete the series of political books, but I really need to be interested in it again. Instead, I found Understanding Power: The Indispensable Chomsky way more interesting, relevant, and conducive to action. Many modern non-fiction books contain the knowledge of history using the science of now, so books like Debt: The First 5000 years and books by Jared Diamond feel vastly superior. Cognitive science, starting with conceptual metaphors seemed the best place to start for epistemology.
 
 So, it seems an empirical, progressive, city-dwelling, creative, social, traveling, hippie life is indeed the way to go. Besides, perhaps I'll be able to get through some of these books through audiobooks while in transit or doing some non-brainy work. Or, I won't, but I'll understand the ideas through more interesting experiences. In the joy of gaining knowledge I always overdo it, and in doing so, gain less.
 
 update:
 In hindsight, it seems it was more of a journey of figuring out how books are organized, or, how knowledge is organized in books. Watching a film, one gains insight of nearly the entire humanities. Non-fiction books don't. My interest was philosophy, but even the Wikipedia article wasn't satisfactory in organizing the books for me. Nor was The Great Books or the Columbia class. It wasn't until I found Reddit's Reading List that I felt at ease. And in doing so, I feel happier. For now. 3586 2014-09-20 01:52:33 2014-09-20 05:52:33 open closed a-personal-journey-through-books publish 0 0 post 0 Communication Literature Media Philosophy of Education _edit_last 1 My Education http://rahilpatel.com/blog/my-education Tue, 04 Nov 2014 11:26:41 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=2384 [pending, took one stab at it.

 Recently, after being awoken by The Great Ideas of Philosophy lecture series by The Great Courses during my time in Taiwan, I became interested in gaining a <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/a-liberal-arts-self-study-curriculum" title="A Liberal Arts Self Study Curriculum">"liberal arts education"</a>. It was cut short as I came to the conclusion that <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/the-obsolescence-of-literature-and-the-future-of-education" title="The Obsolescence of Literature and the Future of Education">books merely organize my experience into a written language</a>. After this conviction, I decided to go over my education historically, to see how my knowledge developed.
 
 Childhood:
 Playing games with friends, biking, exploring neighborhoods, eating, family vacations, family events (Indian marriages), fixing computers, fixing other things, staying up late, waking up late, always doing something.
 
 Age 1-3:
 I don't know. I'm told I was really cute. What happened to me afterward, or to other's opinion, I am not sure.
 
 Age 4:
 I was given a bike. I biked a lot.
 
 I also went to pre-school. No problems there according to this report card: "Favorite activity: likes the computer, building with blocks, the playhouse. I get mad when: I bump my head. When I grow up, I'm going to be: Santa Claus. I like to go to: the beach, the park, and the 300." Even now I wouldn't alter those answers. I'm surprised I liked the computer in 1991. Was I referring to my Dad's Tandy 2000(?) or the school's computer with Math Blaster?
 
 Age 5:
 I kicked off those pesky training wheels. I went further around my neighborhood. I loved kindergarten. I could play with the sandbox, read random books; National Geographic was cool then.
 
 Elementary School:
 Since age 4, I played with my friends who lived on the street and my cousins when they came, or when I went to their houses. I lived in the suburbs, but my neighborhood was surprisingly bike friendly with ditches behind houses and trails that followed alongside.
 
 I did fine at Elementary school. Straight A's in fourth grade, and I particularly remember first, second, and fourth grades quite well. I wrote rather slowly, and often very neatly when I did, and really disliked writing much because of it. Although Algonquians were interesting, my hand hurt.
 
 I showed my first sign of grade slippage at fifth grade, and perhaps an increase in sleeping.
 
 Middle School:
 My best friend of third to fifth grade had moved. We used to go on bike adventures, jump ditches, fight, and talk over esoteric interests.
 
 Slowly, I gravitated toward console games and computers. I also remember using Napster to download music. My knowledge of music aesthetics was expanding, from Eminem to Wu-Tang to Radiohead! I was still placing third on track running (my body height restricted me) and high on physical tests.
 
 Middle school was a place to sleep, be conditioned to change classes when the bell rang, four to six times a day? I don't remember any of it.
 
 High School:
 I continued with more time allocated to indoor activities, perhaps Diablo II had come out. I also continued sleeping in school, doing quite poorly during freshman year. At least there were less bells.
 
 Then I moved temporarily to my Dad's motel. It's on a commercial road of which had no interest whatsoever. It was my worst time, clearly shown by my chubby face. The first and only time I had one. It didn't even have good internet, so I had trouble playing any sort of game. I was into some horrendously slow RPGs (from MMOPG.net? Or something?) and Starcraft and maybe Firearms (a Half-life mod); Whenever someone would call, I would be lag, die or be forced to quit in the game.
 
 Yet, I did well in school. Did I give up on exploring, completely fall victim to the passive educational system? I remember being angry for not being able to get a driver's license while the other kids did.
 
 Then I moved, deeper into the suburbs, a rich gated community, with no child playing outside in sight. I don't know what happened to my bicycle. I guess I didn't care either. I didn't have my friends to bike with. I'm not sure what I did with my free time then. Perhaps I continued with internet and games.
 
 I remember one great class: electric tech. You'd just have a workbench full of super glue guns, materials for circuits, materials for woodworking, and G3 Macs with audio and video editing software. It was heaven. We'd make remote control toy cars, circuits, watch Chapelle Show, listen to Kanye, and just enjoy. At least, that's what I remember. And the teacher, Mrs. Knaack, was awesome. It was perhaps also influential to a classmate who later created music for rappers.
 
 College August 2005 – May 2009:
 After high school, I immediately entered college for a bachelor's in Computer Science. There were several math and science requirements, maybe one literature / writing, and perhaps more that I forgot. But, nothing felt cohesive or striking.
 
 One class was exceptional for being practical. One where I had to build a web forum. Lame, but it was perhaps one of the few outlets of creativity. Wow, that's crazy to think of now: a single outlet of creativity from four years?
 
 I think the first year I had spent quite some time on World of WarCraft and Team Fortress II. After that, I spent a lot of time playing <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/a-critical-analysis-of-super-smash-bros-melee" title="A Critical Analysis of Super Smash Bros. Melee">Super Smash Bros. Melee</a> with what became a great group of friends.
 
 I'd continue to consume media through the internet. Random videos, lots of Wikipedia. Really disjointed. Though, by the second year, perhaps because of the advent of high-speed internet, I consumed <em>a lot</em> of music. It was 2007. I listened to everything on Pitchfork, loving Grizzly Bear and Beach House, and seeing them in concert. Similarly, with the advent of Netflix, I consumed <em>a lot</em> of films. I watched There Will Be Blood, No Country for Old Men, Chungking Express, and a ton of foreign films. I remember watching two films a week, returning them immediately and queueing the next. In no time I reached the classics of films: Tokyo Story, Yi Yi, Harakiri, 400 Blows, Life is Beautiful, Bicycle Thieves, and so on.
 
 Software Developer at Segin Systems in Virginia Beach, VA
 My first “professional” job. I developed code for their flagship web based real estate software. Most of the time was spent implementing interfaces to scrape data from ancient third party title software databases to be sent via web services. The rest of the time was spent extending the superbly coded web site, written by the lead developer who made fine use of the .NET framework. An amazing first programming job as there were only two other developers, and most of the time was spent programming. 
 
 Work near Home February – October 2010:
 I worked as a programmer near my parent's house. I worked. I made money. I continued playing Smash Bros., though less. I continued watching films perhaps at an near equal rate. Still, I hadn't taken much action in life, and had a rather narrow view of life because of it.
 
 I knew I was going to leave my hometown, but I thought it was best to have a little “experience” before doing so. After about nine months of working, I quit. Then I went to San Francisco.
 
 San Francisco February – May 2011:
 Something enlivened me immediately when I got out of the airport, into The Mission, at a cheap hotel where a nice owner directed me toward a nearby street to eat some peruvian fish dish. <em>I began to explore again</em>. I had a whole city to explore, by foot, metro, bus, and later, bicycle. There was so much to learn, so much to do. But I worked really far from my apartment in San Francisco, so I only had the weekends free to explore, learn.
 
 I quickly found an apartment on craigslist. Equally quickly, to my surprise, I found a job on craigslist somewhat related to the game industry.
 
 I worked as something less than a programmer for a larger company. I made money.
 
 I knew and warned that I was going to leave within the first week, but I stuck to the job because I was still absorbing the experience, mainly related to living in San Francisco. I tried to help the company as much as I could but I came to the conclusion that my radical (in their perspective) input was meaningless in a large company, and my desire for something more meaningful, or at least more meaningful than managing websites for terribly bland MMORPGs, made me leave.
 
 I'd spend the weekends exploring.
 ... TO BE CONTINUED.

 Pros and cons of my education:
 
 Pros:
 - Not basing art on history, and generally not being able to decipher art from life
 - Requires more creativity in dialog to talk out an idea, or references something from personal experience, or from contemporary media
 - More active
 - More experiential
 - More fun
 - Able to understand everything one experiences
 
 Cons:
 - Appearing less knowledgable because of the inability to relate it to a larger context of the humanities
 - Learning may be less efficient at times because there is no structure
 - Learning may be significantly uneven because there is no structure
 - Slowed learning during early years without direction or tutor* (of middle school, high school, and college, only two classes stood out) 2384 2014-11-04 06:26:41 2014-11-04 11:26:41 open closed my-education publish 0 0 post 0 Art Philosophy of Education _edit_last 1 そして父になる (Like Father Like Son) http://rahilpatel.com/blog/like-father-like-son Mon, 13 Oct 2014 02:55:13 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=2496 My favorite film director, Hirokazu Koreeda, film from 2013, Like Father Like Son, continues his consistent master-craft.
 
 I personally have not seen a film in many months because I was living a very social life, and it had become quite difficult to become engaged with a video from a screen.
 
 I've been in my parent's house for more than a month, slowly transforming from a manic to a sloth, from peak creativity to hibernation. Finally, I gave in to watching a film, allowing some one else to direct my thoughts.
 
 Instead of giving a review, I've decided to just post my thoughts during the film. I watched it in two sessions, the first, actively philosophical, and the second, more similar to my college days -- absolutely mesmerized. And so, my thoughts are divided as such, unequal in length.
 
 <h2>My Thoughts</h2>
 session one:
 It's been a very long time since I've been able to watch a film, and even when I did, the content of the film matched the lifestyle I was living in, for example, Tsai-Ming Liang films while living on the streets of Taiwan.
 
 I can't help to philosophize while watching, not of art aesthetic, but of knowledge.
 
 Japan, school and work is so artificial: both appear like offices.
 
 It is always more interesting to watch films of places one is unfamiliar with. If one watches films that take place in corporate America, one doesn't realize it's even there.
 
 An old thought: to choose media is uncreative. Why consume it in the first place? Does it really substitute an experience?
 
 The family lives in a house, and schedules life by time, and forcing a schedule on their child. No external stimulus is at play. No time to play games.
 
 Watching the life of house people is odd. What are they really doing? Following something they practiced, that society taught, or parents taught? How did they choose their current daily actions? Japanese people are so robotic. I wonder, did they always live in sepearate housing? Whereas South Asians lived together in large families? [I googled a good article to read]
 
 Japanese people sure do have giant libraries. Perhaps the reason why their culture is so insular is because their consumption is so [harks negative affects of suburbs thought]. If one lives in a suburban house, one consumed what's in the house, not outside. What's inside is media: manga, cute books, Japanese movies, etc.
 
 My view of life has quite changed. As I watch the film, I notice more. I see that the house exists. It's artificial. Their lives are determined by social interaction. Like watching people as I travel, I watch this film, the people at the wedding, my family. It is interesting to see what actions people take, rather than take action myself.
 
 The family has an expensive DSLR, and the kid knows how to use it, without thinking of its affects or it's existence.
 
 This film is fucking great, in pacing, tracking shots to provide thinking time, gestalts, setting.
 
 The wife's mother highly regards people with money.
 
 An idea from another person affected an individual, greatly.
 
 It's quite similar to A Separation, in that an ethical argument is given, and portrayed realistically and masterfully.
 
 Education, knowledge, social determinism, it's all here.
 
 Which education is better? Planned or playful. Clearly playful environment. But the father shouldn't always act so childish to the kids, should he?
 
 The grandmother feels the home is like a hotel, as do the other couple's kid. The amount of knowledge that pours from this film is more vast and succinct than that of most writers of the Western Canon.
 
 "Don't you think that, for kids, giving them time is everything."
 
 The father only realizes this now, after being raised in such a competitive society, he forgot the value of spending time. So isolated from life, so robotic.
 
 Classic nature vs nurture debate.
 
 The father is taking more part in the decision, although he spent far less time. A problem of gender inequality.
 
 session two:
 I just watched it as I did films in college, without philosophical analysis, profoundly.
 
 "Spending time" is experience. Is it because I had little experience with my family, neither parent, I do not feel my parent's house is my home? My parent's first house was home because my friends lived on the same street. My parent's second house is not.
 
 after the film [at a suburban home, alone]:
 After watching the film I had a long dream of treating mom and documenting it. "Taking Mom to Taiwan". I would just record times I spend with her, showing a slow recovery from the negative symptoms of schizophrenia, and later piece then together with some transition scenes for time to contemplate between, like Koreeda's films. I was quite successful in the treatment, as she then lived a healthy life in Taiwan, with her own Indian food shop. We both went to some film festival and won. I hadn't told her about the film, and we just had fun and talked over the mic. I asked her a few serious questions for the audience, and she answered them. After that, I thanked a few Asian directors for their contemplative films, and Koreeda for being the impetus for the film, and Taiwan, for showing me life.
 
 It seems, in the suburbs, I constantly substitute action with daydreaming. 2496 2014-10-12 22:55:13 2014-10-13 02:55:13 open closed like-father-like-son publish 0 0 post 0 Art Film Reviews Films _edit_last 1 _yoast_wpseo_primary_category medium_post O:11:"Medium_Post":11:{s:16:"author_image_url";s:74:"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/200/200/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png";s:10:"author_url";s:28:"https://medium.com/@rahil627";s:11:"byline_name";N;s:12:"byline_email";N;s:10:"cross_link";s:2:"no";s:2:"id";s:11:"17a4195ba9f";s:21:"follower_notification";s:3:"yes";s:7:"license";s:19:"all-rights-reserved";s:14:"publication_id";s:2:"-1";s:6:"status";s:6:"public";s:3:"url";s:61:"https://medium.com/@rahil627/like-father-like-son-17a4195ba9f";} _yoast_wpseo_content_score 60 Des hommes et des dieux (Of Gods and Men) http://rahilpatel.com/blog/des-hommes-et-des-dieux Tue, 14 Oct 2014 10:25:00 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=2508 After watching a recent film by my favorite film director, I found on Wikipedia it was commended by the jury that awards the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prize_of_the_Ecumenical_Jury" title="Prize of the Ecumenical Jury">Prize of the Ecumenical Jury</a>. It is one of the juries of the Cannes Film festival with an objective to "honour works of artistic quality which witnesses to the power of film to reveal the mysterious depths of human beings through what concerns them, their hurts and failings as well as their hopes.". From my experience of the few films I've seen in the list, and of the many directors of films who've I've seen, it seems this is a great source of philosophy in film. After finding that, I decided to print it out and plaster it next to a few other syllabi I have for my temporary self-education.
 
 I hope to continue to watch the rest of the films in the list, thinking deeply of the actions people take, how they came to decide it, the effects of external forces, and whatever other questions may arise.
 
 Continuing the trend starting from <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/like-father-like-son" title="Like Father Like Son">the last film I had watched</a> of posting my thoughts, as opposed to reviewing a film, and forcing me to review my thoughts, edits appear in square brackets "[]", what follows are my thoughts during the viewing of Des hommes et des dieux (Of Gods and Men).
 
 <strong>My Thoughts</strong>:
 How do people form convents? Need a source: evangelists. Is just finding the bible enough for people to teach it? [Reminds me of a short story by Borjes in Ficciones]. This surely must have died in developed countries where internet is prevalent.
 
 The priests read religious texts (Quran, St. Francis de Assisi, etc.), absolutely naive to dogmatic material.
 
 The framing the in this and Like Father Like Son are varied. Sometimes faces takes a fourth of the screen. Sometimes the camera moves with transit or people walking. [Zoom is necessary. Stabilization not so, but nice to have.]
 
 Life would have been quite different without the internet, and Wikipedia.
 
 Religion and culture is always weird to me because they are dogmas. They don't make practical sense. Senseless traditions. It's amazing how much time people have to spend on these things. Neither have monetary value. Neither is real work: the movement of objects or knowledge [science].
 
 These things (religion, culture, government) form because people are social [Aristotle], which later leads to the formation of laws.
 
 The priests do their work, ignoring the world, like the father in the last film did his -- without play, following dogma. [Priests are like strict parents]
 
 Film could be a great way to make an argument!
 
 The priest choses not to take action (via reaction). A passive life?
 
 So much time wasted while working [in the field or praying]. They could be listening to audiobooks!
 
 If a religious armed person shares your own religion, you might be okay [safe], it seems.
 
 This is another very good film of ethical decisions.
 
 Both films do often use depth of field.
 
 A progressive character in a convent? Interesting. I guess it's because he's the youngest. [It takes a habitual life over time to lose sight of progressivism]. Also interesting people sometimes desire to live outside of the convent, or at least the thought comes about during a dangerous time; During an earlier time in life, they decided to leave their homes to live a life "for Christ".
 
 If one lives in such a style for 60 years, would one change to another? Only if one is forced to, or comes across some serious event to change one's mind.
 
 Technology won't arrive there any time soon, neither would have many books.
 
 The priests are very familial, caring for each other like mothers.
 
 As a kid the youngest priest wanted to be a missionary. He must have been exposed to missionaries really early.
 
 I read that these kinds of priests rarely idly talk. I think that adds to their conduciveness to dogmatic beliefs. Dialogue, is the social way of gaining intelligence, with peers, not ancient authorities.
 
 Getting sleepy here...
 
 It seems the main priest entails a bias in his speeches. Saying their actions [to stay at the convent] now matter, because their incarnations [does Christianity even have incarnation?] depend on it. Even another priest says it's okay to die -- "who ever saves their life shall die, whoever shall lose it preserves it". Well, I guess people use prayers to justify their actions?
 
 They only give into pleasure when nearing death: wine and music. Such an awful life -- the disciplined one. [Perhaps it is only possible to live such a dull life with abstinence. And, perhaps, the abstinence of pleasure leads to a passive life, a lack of reaction, and therefore, action.] There are no bad effects to several kinds of pleasure. They react profoundly. So much emotional response from the music, an artificial stimulus.
 
 The film gives good insight to the lives of these kinds of lifestyles though. [Buddhists may be compared to them.] 
 
 Remote communities give opportunity to remote [guerilla-style] crimes. Guerrilla warfare almost requires far flung groups of people: easy targets.
 
 Why don't people travel to cities? Some travel there for goods [one priest brought wine and cheese from what I believe is a place of higher population]. The priests wouldn't be needed if the village just transported to the city. Does this village provide goods for the city? Farming? Yeah, I guess that's the reason.
 
 With the internet, farms must be an okay place to live now, maybe even nice for people who enjoy a quiet life. Still, a dangerous choice in life, and narrow in knowledge. Even with the internet, people are social animals, and if one limits their social life with people in their village, it limits their knowledge -- such an absurd phenomena. [todo: explore reasons for differences in amount of knowledge, if any, between cities and villages (I consider suburbs a contemporary form of a village)***]
 
 The film is horrendously slow. Though, some ideas do require a lengthy experience to really digest. I could have read the synopsis of the film, but would I have similarly digested it? Perhaps I can try afterward. Perhaps it's similar to reading a book and it's synopsis: one doesn't have much material and time (pacing), to formulate why things happened.
 
 The subject of the film is why each priest made the decision (if any) to stay. What's not shown is the other side of decision-making: the insurgents. Did each of the insurgents decide to follow people who making unethical killings? Perhaps there was even less brain activity on their side.
 
 Though not much communication exists between the priests, they are intelligent, especially found in the testament by Christian given at the end of the film. He knows how discrimination lead to conflicts; He loves the country and it's people, even if they kill him. Perhaps an exemplar of non-violence. [the first communication between the insurgents was a very good example of non-violent communication, and it was successful]
 
 Hah, Amadee lived for another 12 years, indeed outliving them all.

 If a person's goal is to gain a lot of knowledge, then an efficient way of quickly gaining it is worth considering.
 
 In the past I made <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/nomadism-culture-and-the-playful-quest-for-knowledge">a personal post about a way of living</a>, progressive education [todo: books are dead], but I this post covers learning fundamentally, the transfer of knowledge.
 
 Let's start with two methods: boring and fun.
 
 The boring method:
 Either one's genes evolved to tolerate this or one was raised in the same environment as the academia of ancient greeks.
 
 The stereotype academic life, steeped in Wikipedia, and perhaps, books. Higher education. Sometimes talks with peers at school, but mostly habitually robotically consuming information from printed material. The life of Kant, Einstein, Chomsky, and what I imagine of most intellectuals. Routine to a desk full of open books and computer screens.
 
 Life and learning:
 Though the goal is to learn, it misses the other part: living life; "to live and learn". The complete goal is to maximize learning while living (having new experiences).
 
 My life:
 My History of Learning. [todo: need to write a short blog about my personal history of learning. How grow in an entirely artificial world grasping concepts without knowledge that they're learning, and it's not limited to books. Not knowing what philosophy was while constantly thinking about it. Watching a lot of films when Netflix was created. Reading Wikipedia for everything I didn't know.]
 
 An ideal future:
 As the world adds ever more content in ever more an organized manner, people learn more than ever before. Perhaps people aren't smarter, instead, the materials of learning is better.
 
 Two improvements: The media is aesthetically pleasing, and most of the media is interactive, meant to be played with others.
 
 Life is generally fun and educational. One is living and learning what they wish. People are constantly interacting in ways to gain or explore knowledge. It is not connected to an institution of any sort. All media is available for everyone. Naturally, people will gather in public spaces to play the media. People will meet others. Perhaps they will become friends and meet regularly. Perhaps some of the people who play will go play somewhere else with other people to gain knowledge (There is no external social force to play in one place or time). Some people play at night, some during the day. Some find it's better to play with a different group of people every day to mixing media and people. Some people like to replay past media on one day, and new media on the others. Some play alone.
 
 The media people play sometimes correlate with their current work, so if a workplace exists, that kind of media can often be played with those people, providing a gestalts effect.
 
 ... hmmm more to explore here, lol. 2523 2014-10-17 00:46:35 2014-10-17 04:46:35 open closed learning-in-the-information-age publish 0 0 post 0 Life Philosophy of Education _edit_last 1 Public Spaces and Action http://rahilpatel.com/blog/public-spaces-and-action Sun, 02 Nov 2014 11:12:35 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=2530 I feel there is an association to public spaces and action.
 
 By public spaces I'm mostly thinking of anywhere outside of a building, inside of a city: streets, parks, and plazas.
 
 The lack of private space, lack of media, vicinity of people and nature, and the resulting stimulation from the two, is all conducive action.
 
 Just being the in public in a city offers so much external stimuli. The more dense, people and materials, the more stimulation. If there are things to interactive with, then one is likely to do so: buy something, play an arcade or board game, talk to people.
 
 The more interactive the space, the likely people will take action. To make a space more interactive, there should be things to play with and tools to make things with. The higher the variety of things, the more diverse the crowd [not sure about this sentence, just writing my mind]
 
 If one has been exposed to aesthetics, and intends to create something, the mass amount of stimulation should flow in tons of ideas.
 
 If one is constantly exposed to massive amounts of stimulation, one may not be able to make sense of the world, seeing it as a disorganized mass of data, and find it absurd to take any kind of action.
 
 Welp, that turned out to be a very short thought. 2530 2014-11-02 06:12:35 2014-11-02 11:12:35 open closed public-spaces-and-action publish 0 0 post 0 Art Essays Literature Urban Philosophy _edit_last 1 Information, Media, Education, and Power http://rahilpatel.com/blog/information-media-and-education Wed, 22 Oct 2014 05:05:27 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=2534 aka What Does Media Want?
 
 [todo: grab info from <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/learning-in-the-information-age" title="Learning in the Information Age">Learning in the Information Age</a> and delete it]
 
 A random thought.
 
 Not really in the beginning, there was man. Man took in the world of information as any other animal would, responding instinctively. If the man was lucky, he had parents, or a social group to follow and learn how to deal with the world. Man was the first thing to organize knowledge.
 
 Later, he was able to able to turn objects into words. If the man was lucky, he had older people to give him more words. Man with words may have been able to organize more knowledge, because one can't always point at objects.
 
 Later, he was able put words into objects. Objects became knowledgeable! Whoa.
 
 The first of which was writing. Until modern times, people used written material as their secondary source of organized knowledge. The first being oral language, unless one lived a cruel childhood.
 
 The second was picture. Pictures perhaps illustrated complex ideas and machinations during ancient times; an example: maths. More recently, it's possible kids grew up reading comic books (or manga), during their knowledge-formative years.
 
 The third, moving pictures. Soon after comic books blew up, television and films pervaded to provide a constant view of reality, or a poorly acted one, through streams of video. Most kids do experience a lot of this during their formative years.
 
 The fourth, games. Games resemble less of a medium and more back to the original way knowledge was transmitted, before oral and written languages: through human interaction, play.
 
 The last is an mix of mediums: the internet. It includes all of the above mediums, but limits it to a screen.
 
 a thought from before 2/9/12:
 <blockquote>
 Perhaps why I prefer film, or even comic book to books is because they display more information in less time.
 
 Or perhaps I need to read faster.</blockquote>
 
 As information becomes more organized, people learn faster. This renders older forms of media less useful. The medium that most closely resembles reality will usually be more efficient in transmitting knowledge.
 
 That is, given an equal amount of time and relatively equal content, the child who reads books will understand less than that of one that watches film, and even less than that who learns everything with a kind tutor.
 
 Each time a new medium is found, people put their knowledge into it. Bless them. For I do not believe that people would have as much knowledge as they do now without those kind, caring people.
 
 <blockquote>2/9/12 (?, well some time in New York)
 I haven't played/beat a full video game since college. Why? Because there is no new knowledge or philosophy to be gained from it. I wonder if I'll get bored of films too...then only books will be left.</blockquote>
 
 Though it is more pleasurable to start from media that most closely replicates experience and go backward, unfortunately, it's only been a century since more modern mediums have existed or been preserved, and all of the knowledge of books, and certainly Wikipedia, have not been organized into the modern mediums.
 
 Though in the defense of games, humanities is not the only thing games are good for.
 
 [does this belong to this post?]
 <blockquote>11/28/2014

 In addition to being more pleasurable, <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/the-most-powerful-forms-of-art" title="The Most Powerful Forms of Art">it is more powerful</a>, in its ability to incite reaction.
 
 The more powerful a media, the more influence it has on people. 2534 2014-10-22 01:05:27 2014-10-22 05:05:27 open closed information-media-and-education publish 0 0 post 0 Essays Literature Thoughts _edit_last 1 _yoast_wpseo_primary_category medium_post O:11:"Medium_Post":11:{s:16:"author_image_url";s:74:"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/200/200/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png";s:10:"author_url";s:28:"https://medium.com/@rahil627";s:11:"byline_name";N;s:12:"byline_email";N;s:10:"cross_link";s:2:"no";s:2:"id";s:12:"d42c33cfaf2e";s:21:"follower_notification";s:3:"yes";s:7:"license";s:19:"all-rights-reserved";s:14:"publication_id";s:2:"-1";s:6:"status";s:6:"public";s:3:"url";s:79:"https://medium.com/@rahil627/information-media-education-and-power-d42c33cfaf2e";} What makes a classic, classic? http://rahilpatel.com/blog/what-makes-a-classic-classic Wed, 22 Oct 2014 06:24:17 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=2540 In answering this question, one comes closer to what one should focus on creating.
 
 Though for each medium (or new media) there are steps in aesthetics that accumulate to what makes a modern example of that medium, the steps are often forgotten.
 
 What makes a classic are those things that offer a perspective of life, and allows time to reflect on it.
 
 As I've mentioned before, my favorite films are the slow, contemplative ones by Asians: Still Walking, Like Father Like Son, Yi Yi, Tokyo Story. These films capture families realistically, allowing the viewer to observe human condition.
 
 Those aren't just my favorites, there are more that I consider classics. My favorites happen to have nuclear families as their subject, but it isn't limited to such. Other films I'd still consider classics: Tree of Life, Apu trilogy, Chop Shop, 400 Blows, La Haine, Vive L'Amour, 4 Months 3 Weeks 2 Days, Nobody Knows, Grave of Fireflies, Bicycle Thieves, Ikiru, Kiki's Delivery Service, A Separation. All of these films contain people. They too portray life realistically and explore the human condition.
 
 It seems to me that's it. <strong>A classic is an art object that realistically portrays life and deeply explores the human condition.</strong> To have good aesthetics (design, pacing, style) are icing.
 
 I have not read classic fiction books, but I imagine the following novels of realism do similar justice: Anne Karrenina, War and Peace, Madame Bovary, Middlemarch, The Brothers Karamazov, Crime and Punishment.
 
 Video games vary, and I have not experienced one that offers nearly as much insight into human life as the other mediums, but it's possible. Jason Rohrer's early games are a start. Jonathan Blow's Braid had a good character. Anna Anthropy's Dys4ia is the greatest example I can currently think of. All are linear experiences. Still, none compare. But there are many other directions for games. When art is an interaction, it can't be duplicated, which is kind of a requirement of a classic, that it can be re-experienced.
 
 New media, performance art, public art, interactive art, etc. are different beasts They usually serve as steps by pushing aesthetics forward (Duchamp), from object to experience (Fluxus), from experience to interaction (Fluxus again?), and so on. Once they become interactive, they follow the same fate as interactive games: unable to become a classic. Ai Wei Wei's work and Banksy just don't quite fit or compare to those classic films or books. [I may be missing some classic performance arts, such as plays and dance] 
 
 I may argue for Brandon Stanton's Humans of New York photograph and text series, and Vincent Moon's music and performance video series, as they provide insight into humans too. Both are archived on the internet, so it is possible to see it all in one viewing, as one normally does classics.
 
 Of recent note, I found the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prize_of_the_Ecumenical_Jury">Prize of the Ecumenical Jury</a> within the Cannes film festival with this stated goal: "honour works of artistic quality which witnesses to the power of film to reveal the mysterious depths of human beings through what concerns them, their hurts and failings as well as their hopes." Their goal is great, but their films tend to be more philosophical.
 
 Also of recent note, one of Calvino's definitions of a classic that I like: "A classic is the term given to any book which comes to represent the whole universe, a book on a par with ancient talismans." This represents the childish ideal all art strives for. 2540 2014-10-22 02:24:17 2014-10-22 06:24:17 open closed what-makes-a-classic-classic publish 0 0 post 0 Art Essays Films Games Literature Philosophy of Film Philosophy of Game _edit_last 1 Caché (Hidden) http://rahilpatel.com/blog/cache Thu, 23 Oct 2014 07:04:22 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=2556 It seems I've transformed into a house and computer person who can consume films now. Some people think if one doesn't have the attention to read a large book that the person is dumb. I contend, one who experiences media and reflects on it, as opposed to reality, has no life. Currently, I have no life.
 
 On to the film.
 
 I will first go over my thoughts [in square brackets], and afterwards some afterthoughts.
 
 <strong>My thoughts</strong>:
 The camcorder in the beginning will look like my cheap camcorder. :(
 
 The neighborhood reminds me of the neighborhood of the hostel in Seoul.
 
 The couple spends a lot of time inside the house. They cook at home with an expensive kitchen. They have a huge library of books, and perhaps film.
 
 They drink red wine. Do they think about what it took to make it?
 
 The family reminds me of that one in Like Father Like Son. Their house like a hotel. The kid must be schooled in geometry and swimming. What use? Habit?
 
 Hah there's a TV show. Why take the time to create such a superficial room? Quite similar to the couple's living room.
 
 The interaction between neighbors is missing. Perhaps they don't even know their neighbors.
 
 A magnificent scene with a dark skinned guy with ambiguous fault. [Equally ambiguous is Georges reaction, whether he reacted that way because the other guy was dark or not]
 
 This kind of paranoia occurs in the western, isolated world.
 
 Perhaps France still has these kinds of problems, of hate, racism or whatever else, but after it developed, they still occur, so these problems seem a bit more odd, and scary [Whoa, I think I nailed it here. Clearly a post-colonial stigma.]. The neighborhood is normally empty, the opposite of villages.
 
 Such a simple action, a tape, letters, provokes so much emotion [I was thinking compared to happier countries or denser cities where one may just disregard it and trash it. It's just material, not a person, sort of thought.]
 
 Fear broods in spaces without people and light.
 
 Such small details in this film and Certified Copy and A Seaparation count, and become exacerbated.
 
 All of these lives, in houses, so odd. They experience so little, except perhaps through books.
 
 Overworking in a developed country, seems to be the trend.
 
 "Isn't it lonely if you can't go out? Is it less if you can sit in a garden?"
 
 "Do you feel less lonely at the metro than at home?"
 
 Oh man, such ethical inquiry. My parents live in a rich neighborhood in the suburbs where they don't know the neighbors. Though not an estate, to me it's a prison compared to a city. Ive asked these same questions to my mom. She didn't retort as successfully as this. I personally feel less lonely in the public.]
 
 "Anyway, I have my family friend. With a remote control. When it annoys me, I shut it down."
 
 Television replaces human interaction. Or any interaction, TV is still a one way communication.
 
 His father played piano. His son prefers to hang out.
 
 A criticism of modern times, and the lack of attention, and rigorous practice.
 
 "Getting old... Lights off? No."
 Hallucinatory visions?
 
 Even the mother lives in a lonely place. Such craziness only exists without much people.
 
 Hah the use of camcorder video intertwining with the real film is so good. Perhaps horror has done this before, but not this well.
 
 Hmm only VHS tapes, and no GPS to check the street name. Perhaps the film can only exist 10 years ago, like No Country for Old Men. Making a film now is too complex [to get around technology].
 
 What makes these films so great is that the characters are smart, complex. They know justice. [They know human values.]
 
 Revenge? And on the other side, guilt. Such a simple concept that harks the mind even at such late ages. [At the time of thinking this, I also thought about New Guineans exacting revenge in tribal warfare because I was reading a book about it.]
 
 Only a guilty person would have gone to the room.
 
 Hmm, another film that deals with the Algerian War, the other being Of Gods and Men I saw within the past week, though, this is only referenced as something done in the past. Perhaps French filmmakers have experienced this themselves and feel strongly about it. [Haneke is indeed quite old and lived during the time. From the Wikipedia article of the mentioned incident in the film, The Paris Massacre of 1961: "After 37 years of denial, in 1998 the French government acknowledged 40 deaths, although there are estimates of over 200." The theme of denial is alluded to.]
 
 Oh man, such good comparison to invasion [colonization?] of Iraq. [Mmm, another colonization thought. Well, this one was an obvious allusion via televised news. As an American-born watching this, it did make it feel more relatable, modern.]
 
 "We will ensure greater homogeneity."
 This is frightening. Not just this line, but the film. [Was that news report real? Homogeneity in Iraq?]
 
 Only in Western countries does so much paranoia occur. Though part of he film is to build horror, knowing where the child is at all times is probably their [the couple's] normal routine.
 
 So much work (bills) for the father, and junk (media, toys, posters) in the child's room.
 
 "If you're alone you'll imagine the worst."
 That's a good friend. She <em>did</em> immediately think of her son getting hit by a car.
 
 Whoa, this film...
 
 It's so good that the film takes place while the characters maintain a normal life, or try to. Work is shown. Raising a child. So much going on.
 
 Rimbaud
 An allusion I'm unaware of, but like Watchmen, every frame of this film matters.
 
 Rimbaud was a poet in his teens, then stopped [making poems], considered a libertine. A Libertine is one devoid of most moral restraints, especially one who ignores or even spurns accepted morals. [Now that's a frightening concept!] Libertines put value on physical pleasures, those through senses. [hmm, that's fascinating, to see where senses and rational must be balanced]. It grew adherents in 17th, 18th, and 19th century France and Great Britian. France sure was a fucked up place. In French novel Dangerous Lessons, the term a dish served best cold was coined, and is considered an early example of Libertine literature. The genre ended with the French Revolution. [what a frightening time, need to Wikipedia Napoleon]. Back to Rimbaud: "Rimbaud was known to have been a libertine and a restless soul. He traveled extensively on three continents before his death from cancer just after his thirty-seventh birthday." Ooof, reading Rimbaud's biography on Wikipedia, there are some comparisons of a strict childhood. "I'm now making myself as scummy as I can. Why? I want to be a poet, and I'm working at turning myself into a seer. You won't understand any of this, and I'm almost incapable of explaining it to you."..."The idea is to reach the unknown by the derangement of all the senses. It involves enormous suffering, but one must be strong and be a born poet. It's really not my fault." Whoa, what a fascinating life. Lots to learn in his actions.
 
 Orphanages breed hatred? Explains revenge.
 
 Those early scenes of guilt and conscience were brilliant.
 
 His mother sleeps with the lights on, but he doesn't.
 
 Meh, these films are too serious. I'd rather chill in Taiwan, without a worry in the world. Except finance and my Chinese. [lol, I was quite scared by the end of it.]
 
 I don't think it's healthy for any life to be solely based on media. It really could damage a formative mind. Good thing I rode my bike all day and still do.
 
 Oh man. The screenplay. Christ it's brilliant.
 
 The father sleeps, a scene plays in which his parents send Majid to the orphanage, for which most of the time I had mistaken it for the protagonist and his wife.
 
 The end, also brilliant, not in a cheesy way in which films revolve, though it does. Masjid's sons tells the protagonists son something, perhaps placing a conscience on him about his father.
 
 <strong>After the film</strong>:
 I was just amazed at how tight the screenplay was, reminding me of A Separation.
 
 Even more, I was amazed by the allusions all over the place. Allusions not just from the television news or even the dialogue about Rimaud, and all the other allusions I missed -- I didn't quite fit in the dog story in my head at the time -- but also the allusions of standard dialog from characters. Every piece of dialog in the film had reason to be there, held weight, symbolism, constantly richening the experience.
 
 The deep, slow shots allow the mind to take in more content, allowing the eyes to wander, whilst reflecting.
 
 Just in <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/what-makes-a-classic-classic">my last blog post</a>, I mentioned the criteria for what makes a classic classic, and this not just meets those, but exceeds them.
 
 I've mentioned before a comparison to Watchmen. Watchmen was a powerful piece of media for me, with its abundance of allusions in every frame, on the frames nearby, symbolism in the chapter, and in the entire novel, constantly interacting with other parts, the details form complex ideas over time. This film similarly accomplishes that, with its allusions, aphorism-filled dialogs, symbolism, interacting and fitting any part of the film, ignoring time, transcending.
 
 <strong>Interpretations</strong>:
 
 I instinctively read <a href="http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-cache-2005">Roger Ebert's review</a>, which lead to his <a href="http://www.rogerebert.com/rogers-journal/cach%C3%A9-a-riddle-wrapped-in-a-mystery-inside-an-enigma">in-depth answer</a> to the film.
 
 Upon reading his review, he mentioned Tuberculosis being a disease in which people cough up blood. I did not know that, but fits. And I wondered, what if the person coughing blood was Georges, making him have TB. I read Wikipedia, and one has "fevers, chills, night sweats, fatigue." All of which Michael had during the film. Well, that's ambiguous, he could have just been in a poor mood. Anyway, it just made me think, Georges had TB, and through guilt, his hallucinatory visions put Majid in his place. Furthermore, his mother is dying too, perhaps of latent TB? A fun thought.
 
 Upon looking at a scene around where Ebert mentioned, after the coughing blood scene, when Georges and his son go to the car, the son waves some plants out of the way, or, does he place a camera? Hah, then I've become paranoid, over-scrutinizing.
 
 After reading the more in-depth review, it makes a lot of sense that the two sons knew each other. At first, I thought Majid's son intentionally met afterward, now I'm going toward the former.
 
 In the comments of the reviews, others have formed their own great ideas:
 
 an example:
 <blockquote>Did anyone notice the movie posters/ads at around 01:26 into the movie? Ma Mere (My mother)& Deux Freres (Two Brothers)? Was Majid G's half brother? Were M's "parents" sent away at a convenient time in France's history so his real mother could adopt him without raising questions.
 
 When G visits his mother she pretends to not remember M. She is visibly upset. M knew G's mother was ill. M had contact with her.
 M says later "WHAT WOULDN'T WE DO NOT TO LOSE WHATS OURS". G to go from single child to have to share. W to be an outsider and to do anything to please. G exploited M's need to belong to be rid of him. How much did G hear when he was a child? Enough to know M was more than adopted?
 
 Majid is forgiving Georges.
 
 M just wants his family. G can't let go of the lies and may believe them. Is G racist? A snob?
 
 Majid's son must have contacted P. They both planned to reunite their fathers. Their grandmother is dying? Majid's son and P tried to bring some peace to both brothers. G refused to see. W would never have his family. So much denial and sadness. No peace for G without the sleeping pills. No family for M ever.</blockquote>
 
 A more encompassing example:
 <blockquote>Okay, I think I have figured out Ebert's "Shooting Gun" based on POV, as well as an ALL ENCOMPASSING solution to the mystery (until you all put a dozen holes through it).
 
 The POV in the shot at about the 20 minute mark before the 'boy with blood' memory has two characteristics: 1) It is a still shot, implying that is is the objective perspective from someone filming, and 2) It is from a second story level at the street leading right up to George's front door.
 
 Therefore, Ebert is implying that the person making the tapes was taping from the second floor of George's house (i.e. Pierrot).
 
 Additionally, even if it a Subjective POV shot, it is still coming from a member of George's household and aimed directly at the spot from which the opening frames of the movie are being filmed. In other words, Pierrot is looking from his bedroom window at the spot from where they are being filmed and knows where the camera is before his parents tell him of the tapes.
 
 (However, unlike Ebert I am not convinced that POV is the solution, because anyone could have been looking from out of that window, out of pure fear, not neccessarily knowledge. They know they are being filmed from that general direction. And if Ebert means the POV of the person seeing the bleeding boy, it seems to be the POV of someone the height of age six, so it had to be George's POV from memory and no one else.)
 
 One issue not discussed anywhere of vital imprtance to solving the mystery is that George is a dedicated liar and never reveals what actually happened between him and Majid, although there are two hints: 1) After killing the rooster Majid appears to approach George with violent intent holding up the axe when the scene suddenly ends, and 2) George tells Majid something to the effect of "You were older and stronger than me, I had no choice". Therefore, what did George do? Was it much more violent than what George finally admits to his wife at the end of the movie? It had to be when he says he was older and stonger and had no choice. George probably beat the living crap out of him and caused him to bleed for days on end, which he has suppressed in his memory as "spontaneous bleeding". George doesn't appear to admit to much and is obviously hiding a lot more as implied from the two scenes just mentioned, which is why it is such a painful memory for the Grandmother. It must have been a lot more violent and the family had to send Majid away for his own safety after brushing the family violence under the carpet, and bringing a doctor in to check the boy after waiting for exterior wounds to heal. Kid's skin wounds heal fast, it could have been a wait of only one or two weeks.
 
 One other issue not mentioned by bloggers which is part of the solution is that Majid may actually be George's brother conceived through an affair between the Grandmother and the Algerian farmhand. This would explain the desire to adopt him and the guilt caused by exiling him at a young age and the mysterious dissappearance of both parents. This theory is based on the fact that Waleed (Majid's son) appears to be in touch with the Grandmother and knows about her health. Why if he is he in touch with her does the Grandmother claim to have no memory of him? Something stinks there to high heaven. The only reason they would be in touch is due to a blood or a continuing adoptive relationship.
 
 In any case the story George tells is very very innocent and could not be the cause of so much trauma on Majid's part and so much guilt on George's part. His only admission is that he said "I saw him bleeding" and "I told him to kill a rooster". Hell, on a farm there is a lot of chicken killing going on.
 
 Majid would only kill himself in that gruesome fashion due to very serious childhood trauma, not just being sent away to boarding school.
 
 I don't think we can say who sent the films, but we can determine who made the films for one good reason: No one had access to Majid's house to film the confrontation between George and Majid except Majid's family. Therefore, Either Majid made the tapes, or his son did (independently or in cohoots with Pierrot, it doesn't matter)
 
 Finally, the second generation seems to know each other based on the closing shot. Majid's son and Pierrot have some kind of positive relationship. Perhaps Majid's son approached him at school and made friends with him. Whether they are in league with one another or not is not important...</blockquote>
 
 For a film to form interpretations of what happened in its entirety is a feat, even more so than Certified Copy, in which one turns into the other.
 
 At the end of the same comment:
 <blockquote>...The point of the movie is that there is a silver lining on the history of violence betwen France and Algeria, led by a new generation that is able to look past racial differences. Pierrot's hero is none other than Algerian Zinedine Zidane who led France to its last World Cup and has his poster hanging on his bedroom wall. This generation can look past racial differences; Pierrot can have a good relationship with Majid's son, although we cannot imagine that George's generation can have an honest relationship with their colonized neighbours.</blockquote>
 
 And for a film to <em>simultaneously</em> hold these symbolisms with strength is an unimaginable feat. 2556 2014-10-23 03:04:22 2014-10-23 07:04:22 open closed cache publish 0 0 post 0 Film Reviews _edit_last 1 _yoast_wpseo_content_score 30 _yoast_wpseo_primary_category medium_post O:11:"Medium_Post":11:{s:16:"author_image_url";s:74:"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/200/200/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png";s:10:"author_url";s:28:"https://medium.com/@rahil627";s:11:"byline_name";N;s:12:"byline_email";N;s:10:"cross_link";s:2:"no";s:2:"id";s:12:"c40219eb723f";s:21:"follower_notification";s:3:"yes";s:7:"license";s:19:"all-rights-reserved";s:14:"publication_id";s:12:"7a04709b0155";s:6:"status";s:6:"public";s:3:"url";s:59:"https://medium.com/@rahil627/cach%C3%A9-hidden-c40219eb723f";} Information Organization, Mediums, Creativity, and Experience http://rahilpatel.com/blog/information-organization-mediums-creativity-and-experience Sun, 02 Nov 2014 10:01:30 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=2593 We receive data sensually.

 That's limiting. The world is full of disorganized data. The way we organize it is a conceptual process. New media explores this.
 
 person --&gt; idea + data --&gt; unknown medium (including performance and interaction)
 
 The more divergent the data of the unknown product, yet still maintaining an idea the better the aesthetic. The more the unknown product explores knowledge (science, humanities) the better the education. The more sensual the unknown product the more pleasurable it becomes and the faster data is transmitted. 2593 2014-11-02 05:01:30 2014-11-02 10:01:30 open closed information-organization-mediums-creativity-and-experience publish 0 0 post 0 Art Essays Literature _edit_last 1 Happiness and Public Spaces http://rahilpatel.com/blog/happiness-and-public-spaces Sun, 02 Nov 2014 09:35:47 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=2595 thoughts from near the beginning of moving to Taiwan:
 <blockquote>Everything can be done locally. The neighborhood is very important. The more traditional, the better. No commute. Just walk outside. It's beautiful.</blockquote>
 
 I feel there is an association between happiness and public spaces.
 
 Countries with traditional markets, a kind of public place, as a rather large part of life -- Taiwan, Southeast Asia (Thailand, Vietnam*, Cambodia* [maybe Loas]), Nepal, Northeast India, Morocco*, Mexico*, seem to be happier. Most, maybe all of them have two kinds of markets: one an outdoors market of farmer's produce and the other for shopping (or strolling) manufactured goods and eating, a simple way to satisfy pleasure.
 
 Taiwan furthers the eating part by creative new kinds of food (in addition to new kinds of manufactured goods) which also satisfies the feeling of doing something new. Taiwan also furthers the strolling part with windowed pet stores.
 
 And countries that have parks. Here people sit, talk, play music, have local drinks or food. Older people can be found here all day, sometimes playing board games, other times drinking and talking. It's better than retirement homes.
 
 In Taiwan, neighborhoods are built in ways to incorporate small parks every few blocks with assorted seats, playgrounds, and funny exercise instruments.
 
 Nepal has large public plazas, it serves the same purpose as parks, but in a less natural way. But one cannot simply destroy those ancient beautiful plazas.
 
 In Korea, beside the large rivers that run through major cities, and near the coasts, a kind of plaza exists, where people can buy or fish(!) seafood and eat by the water.
 
 In Taiwan, Korea, and Japan, there is no law restricting people from drinking alcohol outside. In the college areas, there is often a popular park where kids buy drinks from a nearby convenient store and drink. Such a folly of Western law.
 
 Convenient stores! Not really a public space, but, it has a relationship with them, more than just drinking alcohol. People buy food, cigarettes, and whatever else, sitting outside them, or at the night market, or at a park. They satisfy the more malign needs, including instant noodles. East Asia probably has the highest amount of convenient store density per area; It probably has the highest rational index.
 
 Humans need to satisfy their desires. Having a public place is such a simple way to do so. It allows people to meet, socialize (and oh do people from these countries love to talk!), eat, and shop.
 
 The more per area, the less likely doing something bad (materialism, drugs, prostitution, clubs, bars, etc.) to satisfy desire. Bars, and in a socially alienated way, clubs, are just public spaces commoditized. Malls are corporate night markets.
 
 The bourgeoisie social norms of Western civilization newly found in Eastern civilization perhaps taught through media can be found in the downtown areas of large cities in the forms of clubs, high-class restaurants, and bars. It's highly likely the people that go there are either Western in origin, or rich and took action according to media that influenced them. The public spaces weren't enough, and they wanted more. There's no way of stopping them from going there, they have cars to skip to there destination, ignoring all of the satisfaction found en route. Even with the traffic of the bridge between New Jersey and New York, people will still wait through traffic, park at an expensive garage, wait at a line to get into a club, pay a fee to get inside, and pay extraordinary amounts to buy a drink. Well, now this is digressing. I guess I'll have to leave foot versus car life in another blog post, or read The Death and Life of Great American Cities.
 
 The bourgeoisie social norms of Eastern civilization is not as bad as the West. It's usually just eating expensive food at a restaurant for a long period of time. Karaoke instead of clubs. Having a car is a luxury.
 
 This kinda digressed, but I just wanted to see if I could somehow associate the generally higher happiness of these countries, which I greatly felt, with public spaces.

And after watching the film, I think it belongs to that list. Watching this film and <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/like-father-like-son" title="Like Father Like Son">Like Father Like Son</a> is good for the brain.
 
 During the viewing of this film, I was sleep deprived, perhaps on my 22nd hour of the day, and in a terrible state: I've imprisoned myself in a house for three months now and lost weight [underweight]. Perhaps because of this long-term isolation, the viewing was more immersive. I left relatively few thoughts.
 
 Surprisingly, there were many thoughts on human nature. The main plot device is a symbolism of two kinds.
 
 <strong>Thoughts</strong>:
 <blockquote>Scenes of different places from different lengths and angles go by quickly to show routine life. Such simple yet powerful technique.</blockquote>
 The scenes here are of the mother's life. It showed contemporary city life in Japan really well. It reminded me of how in five minutes or less Pixar films accomplish the same feat, especially that in the film Up and the short film (not Pixar) La Maison en Petits Cubes. It only takes a few minutes to show an entire life and grab the viewer in a somewhat romantic way.
 
 <blockquote>Japanese people, so proper.</blockquote>
 Hah, it's always interesting to see how formal, rational, Japanese people are. I imagine this is the general view from Western civilization.
 
 <blockquote>"Overcoming obstacles", instead of just feely saying or doing something.</blockquote>
 This is another observation of Japanese culture. Perhaps the translation just sounds funny and sticks out because of it, but in many times in other Japanese media, people use "overcoming obstacles" to many very dire situations, especially when coming of age. It sounds trite to me, but it also fits the trend of parents in Japan over-worrying about their kids.
 
 <blockquote>Such a lonely life: Living in an apartment. The father dreams of having a bookcase in a tiny apartment. Their only satisfaction of desire comes from home-cooked food. No fun? No family? No friends?</blockquote>
 Another observation of how rational Japanese culture is. The mother's life seemed so robotic. Home, work, cook, read. It showed very little irrational satisfactions. It's possible some books were hentai, but even then, it's so controlled.
 
 <blockquote>The law isn't friendly to animals, people are afraid of breaking rational social norms, which animal's actions do.</blockquote>
 and a later thought:
 <blockquote>Wolves can be a symbolism for any kind of problem unusual to society.</blockquote>
 The law represented in the film by some health department checking children's shots. The mother is pressured by the law to leave society.
 
 Also, then neighbors are don't accept the barking noises.
 
 There's a great scene where the mother wants to hide her kids from the public. I made me think of how mothers with handicap children feel.
 
 <blockquote>Environment, city versus nature.</blockquote>
 and
 <blockquote>One more human, one more animal</blockquote>
 Obvious, but nice to see the spectrum of rational versus irrational (passionate, creative, etc.) in both humans and environment.
 
 [Update:] I just had the thought: it's interesting that they partially grew up in the apartment. The boy desired home for many of his young years because he grew up in a home environment, only adjusting later. The girl grew up a wolf. It seems the boy represents nurture and the girl, nature.
 
 <blockquote>Cause and effect.</blockquote>
 I often think about cause and effect more nowadays. How seeing a guy led to a baby, led to being shunned by society, led to living a hard life on the farm. The mother's actions were very rational, a grand success. At no point did the film turn malign. The mother didn't abandon her children as shown well in Nobody Knows and from a different cause in Grave of Fireflies. The film never explores nuances in reality, where small decisions and actions have huge effects. Overall, it just follows an optimistic path of a normal good life, a life we are familiar with through most media.
 
 <blockquote>Spending so much time building a home, oh the joy of simple living.</blockquote>
 This may have been two separate thoughts, I can't tell by my handwriting.
 
 The mother spends a lot of time cleaning the house the first time, and several times after the children mess it up. I often feel people spend too much time cleaning the house. If the kids spend more time outside, in nature (or cities) or school (or work), the house shouldn't matter much. People in America spend a lot of money renovating their houses or apartments. Often, it's just a past-time. There isn't a real reason behind it. One can survive with a lot less. So, it's alway weird for me to see how much time people spend on houses, as opposed to experience. Though, in this case, the mother spends the right amount of time.
 
 <blockquote>Books for education.</blockquote>
 Though one can learn from books, the film must take place at a time where computers were less prominent. It's interesting to see how the mother is able to stick to a rigid routine of learning through books, an outdated form of education. If it were taken place in modern times, one could easily just have used a smartphone and do research on wolves and local fauna and plants, and farming. Earlier in the film, they were learning Greek philosophy. Though, I really loved the book truck that came later. That's a new concept to me!
 
 <blockquote>All education from mother.</blockquote>
 Well, I guess not all, as the daughter does go to school. But in the primary years, all formal education comes solely from the mother, and nature. For the son, all of his form education <em>is</em> from his mother.
 
 I always felt nature should be a large part of early education. There's a lot that can form in one's mind given time to play in nature.
 
 It seems like quite a lot of burden from a mother to be the sole human of all education for her children. It's just wild to think that all human knowledge is passed down from her to her children. It's normal, but here it feels primal. Also, I feel Japanese families are generally more nuclear, perhaps reinforced by the small apartments. More emphasis on the nuclear family as opposed to public societies. 
 
 It's also nice to see the boy not attend school at such an early age and go into nature. In America, the normal age is after high school, or after college. I always felt sometime after elementary school seems to be right. A good symbolic nod for progressive education, if the child feels so.
 
 <blockquote>Instinctual pleasure from manual labor.</blockquote>
 An effect of living closer to nature. It's nice to see the children have pleasure running in the wild near their farmhouse and the mother working hard, though, seemingly, enjoying it. It harked the thought that humans desire direct pleasures often, which can be as simple was walking in nature, and how middle class society denies them of it, especially the city culture of Japan. A representative scene was in the city apartment, when the daughter would get angry (and therefore turn into wolf) when she wanted to go walk.
 
 After an education from home,
 
 <blockquote>Four years, no people. Amazing.</blockquote>
 It's astonishing to see how the kids, well, at least the daughter adapted to society after four or so years of living only in the company of their family. In most societies, there are at least one of the following: extended families, kids on the street, friends. But there are those more sheltered households, so I guess it's not so bad. During the viewing, it was astonishing for me, to see so many people, and to see the artificial environment it took place in. Not as frightening as a city though, as the pre-school was not far from the farmhouse. A good step.
 
 <blockquote>Hah, was nice to see that the daughter started as a wolf, then grew more human, and the son the other way around.</blockquote>
 This is probably common; I may have fit the boy's fate.
 
 <blockquote>Though often over-dramatic similar to the director's previous works, it does explore human ethics, especially the theme of rational versus instinct [irrational], and I imagine this is more difficult in a megacity of Japan, the heart of middle-class discontent.</blockquote>
 This thought was followed by:
 <blockquote>A great plot device. It enabled the film to explore the core theme through several situations.</blockquote>
 And lastly:
 <blockquote>It is frightful how I die / do nothing without social stimulus. Without the city, without a need for money, I stop. With travel and civilization, I thrive.</blockquote>
 
 I am not sure if these were during the film or at the end of it. For the most part, as I said, I watched without thought, without any deep analysis.
 
 I agree, the film is aesthetically the same as the last two: anime. It even had a few scenes that reminded me of Akira, when 3d-generated thingies were new and cool. They were rather weird, unfitting to me. Nothing new in aesthetics. Though, there were some beautiful scenes that depicted contemporary life in a Japanese city. In animations, I often think how odd it is to put so much work to mimic real life; I mean, if one spends the time to make an animation, then it should explore some fantastic element that a real production can't, to further aesthetics. Hosoda's films do this, just slightly, perhaps just right, making the films still feel real. A lot of work put into the animation, as usual.
 
 The film is indeed over-dramatic and therefore feels inauthentic. I feel the worst was done with the blaring dramatic music. That's a shame.
 
 It is interesting to see how Japanese people constantly churn out media that explore the nature, not human nature, but natural earth so much. Surely this must be a yearning from living in such artificial places.
 
 The plot device indeed is great. I'm sure it was used in past media several times: man as animal, but I don't remember it being used this well, in contemporary society, as opposed to some wild fantasy or science fiction.
 
 The last thought, as I said, represents my current poor state. I'm currently in a suburb, not even represented in the film, and not worth being. The city provides people, the farm provides nature. The suburbs provide neither.
 
 I remember watching The Girl Who Leapt Through Time, twice. Once the next day. I even spent some time looking at other people's timelines. I wanted to spend more time with the film. I loved it. Similarly here, I want to watch it again. There is something alluring about Hosada's films. Is it because there is more to learn from it? Is it because it contains <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/a-japanese-ideal">ideals</a>, which helps me make better current decisions? Or is it the simple pleasures of life that I desire? I don't know, but it's an exceptional thing. I've only watched a handful of films twice, and Hosada has accomplished in creating this feeling, thrice.
 
 <h2>a later thought</h2>
 <a href="https://hitchtheworld.com/musings/ants-theyve-got-the-right-idea/">Patrick observed ant's</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eusociality">eusociality</a>. That drifted my mind toward wolves. Again, wolves are a good choice because they are often social, part of a pack, for the benefit of the pack as a group, but at times <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lone_wolf_(trait)">wolves remain lone wolves</a>. It's great that Hosoda's film raises wolves, allowing the wolves a choice, ultimately nurturing the lone wolf.
 
 another thought:
 Hmmm, I distinctly remember thinking much about the exclusivity of society while watching the film. Especially of a scene where the mother is a bit ashamed of her kids (in wolf form) being shown to the public. It's easy to think of children with disabilities, orphanages, or just plain abashed, wild children. 2632 2014-11-05 20:15:31 2014-11-06 01:15:31 open closed wolf-children publish 0 0 post 0 Art Film Reviews Films _edit_last 1 _yoast_wpseo_content_score 90 _yoast_wpseo_primary_category medium_post O:11:"Medium_Post":11:{s:16:"author_image_url";s:74:"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/200/200/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png";s:10:"author_url";s:28:"https://medium.com/@rahil627";s:11:"byline_name";N;s:12:"byline_email";N;s:10:"cross_link";s:2:"no";s:2:"id";s:12:"1c72da37f563";s:21:"follower_notification";s:3:"yes";s:7:"license";s:19:"all-rights-reserved";s:14:"publication_id";s:12:"7a04709b0155";s:6:"status";s:6:"public";s:3:"url";s:55:"https://medium.com/@rahil627/wolf-children-1c72da37f563";} Start from Nothing http://rahilpatel.com/blog/start-from-nothing Thu, 06 Nov 2014 09:53:30 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=2651 When I shifted from travel to house person, I found a problem with reading books. Many assumed one knew a bunch of ancient references or body of knowledge.
 
 I simply could not relate to authors of books because they are insular. Too many references from media, usually from the Western Canon (I think I wrote this while reading Antifragile). To understand them is to Wikipedia several references which lead to common ideas. This is not the way to go about creating. One has to start with nothing, assume nothing, like a well designed game tutorial, or a book that starts with series of propositions, or any film.
 
 There hasn’t been many generations that hasn't grown up without great books as a source of knowledge, but of these generation, nearly none of them read them, only know of them, through another media. Few have read Aristotle, but perhaps has a vague idea of his life and writings through references of other media. And that is okay.
 
 I guess the problem I have is that lots of books assume so much, especially with regards to how society acts and knows, and in doing so, made them unreadable.
 
 References to media should always be avoided. It is always better to reference personal experiences, because they are more relatable. And perhaps even more interesting, because it is personal and unique.
 
 [TODO: can write more]
 
 Update:
 I later found writings that begin with a proposition and build from that i.e. Tractacus, The Prince, etc. a decent form.

 I grew up with games, then films, then new media, in that order. I learned what made them aesthetically good by experiencing them, always gradually gravitating toward newer (to me) aesthetic ideas. I learned of new media only once I moved to cities because they only exist there. They're not circulated around the world as films, games, and books are.
 
 Once an aesthetic idea is learned, it sticks. Any later experienced implementation of the same idea is outdated. For example, I read Watchmen first, the rest of comic books (including grpahic novels), seem outdated.
 
 When one creates, the learned aesthetic ideas mingle.

 I would think a few laptops, internet, a secure public place, and a watchman who can teach how to use the computer to learn suffices. If the people do not know a language, then the teacher must teach them just enough language to use the computer for them self-learn. Perhaps there should be a liberal curriculum too, mainly taught through Wikipedia. For advanced peoples, OpenCourseware. Every populated place should have such a space.

 <blockquote>"the work of art can recapture the lost and thus save it from destruction, at least in our minds. Art triumphs over the destructive power of time."</blockquote>
 
 <blockquote>"we are all capable of producing art, if by this we mean taking the experiences of life and transforming them in a way that shows understanding and maturity."</blockquote> 2663 2014-11-06 03:30:03 2014-11-06 08:30:03 open closed art-objects publish 0 0 post 0 Art _edit_last 1 Contemporary Philosophy Books are too Bulky http://rahilpatel.com/blog/contemporary-philosophy-books-are-too-bulky Thu, 06 Nov 2014 08:43:03 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=2665 It's natural for people to have an idea of the nature of the world, but I find it unnecessary for such lengthy proofs.
 
 If one is presenting a new proposition, then it should be just that. No book required. The proposition will likely be invalidated soon.
 
 Books should be formatted and ordered as such: proposition, a few of the best examples that cover nearly everything.
 
 The books that brought this thought at the time were Antifragile, and Surfaces and Essences.
 
 Only one of the charts was needed for Antifragile. Surface and Essences could have used some graphical representation of examples too.
 
 Books that have several ideas, say The Death and Life of Great American Cities, should still follow another format: all propositions, then all propositions again with examples (cases).
 
 Gladly, some fine people usually take care of the extraction and post it to Wikipedia.
 
 God, books are such a lame way to transmit content.

 With that known, and according to my history [todo: need to link blog], it is natural to choose the more pleasurable art objects or experience.
 
 I naturally chose games, then films, then new media, then books, in that order. Of course I used Wikipedia to follow up, and dialog with friends. It's interesting to see that books came last in my education; It is my last choice in gaining information.
 
 If one want to learn about ethics, watch a film rather than read a book. If ones wants to learn about strategy, play a strategy game rather than watch a film. If one wants to learn how to make something, make it rather than observing others make things.
 
 If one of the goals of education is to make subjects interesting, then using newer art mediums is a natural method, especially for a self-education where experience is impossible (stuck in a house) or just really inconvenient.
 
 A lot of my history was just random play (hedonism?) rather than a directed curriculum, but luckily, there's enough content in the world where one can learn and live via newer art objects and experience while living a surprisingly pleasurable life. 2678 2014-11-07 00:36:57 2014-11-07 05:36:57 open closed growing-up-with-technology publish 0 0 post 0 Epistemology Essays Literature Media Philosophy of Education Philosophy of Technology _edit_last 1 City Experience and Media http://rahilpatel.com/blog/city-experience-and-media Fri, 07 Nov 2014 06:21:23 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=2686 A thought after coming to my parent's house:
 <blockquote>
 10/6
 Within the past few days I had these thoughts:
 If a person grows up in a city, and isn't completely isolated within a house, that person would have been exposed to more information, through all senses, than he would have in a controlled environment. In a controlled environment (house, class, suburbs) data is directed by educators and/or media. Growth depends entirely on the interaction of the person with other persons. And if there are no persons, then an interactive media, such as the internet.
 
 No. There's a lot to learn in a house, there's just more in a city. Interactions of masses of people in the public cannot be entirely comprehended. If one has leisure time in a city, it's quite easy to max a brain out with the sensorial input of the artificial and people.
 
 It's quite difficult to emulate the city experience at home, and even more difficult when one combines media and city life: simultaneously listening to headphones, talking to multiple friends on a smartphone, while on a subway. Human interaction cannot be emulated; It can only be observed. The closest practical solution to creating as much input is Veidt's: an array of televisions, and perhaps each with it's own audio output. And even then some of those televisions should have a person simply walking with a video camera, which no television program does.
 
 When I arrived to my parent's house I experienced a huge step down in the feeling of experience, and I've never been able to get to a city level, and sure not an Asian city levels. It's too artificial, cold. In order for me to create I cannot be in a void, or perhaps only temporarily, like late nights at a library. But I still need a stimulus-filled normal life.</blockquote>
 
 Life cannot be emulated.
 
 The amount of sensorial information gained from a city cannot be surpassed by media unless the media is interactive, and even then, it's quite difficult.
 
 If one grows up in the suburbs, or in a house far from having any sort of public life, it is natural for a person to try to consume as much media as one can to simulate the city. Technology now allows people to communicate, and even then, it's not quite the same as physically being in proximity. 2686 2014-11-07 01:21:23 2014-11-07 06:21:23 open closed city-experience-and-media publish 0 0 post 0 Communication Epistemology Life Media Thoughts _edit_last 1 Time, Social Life, and External Stimuli http://rahilpatel.com/blog/time-social-life-and-external-stimuli Fri, 07 Nov 2014 06:30:25 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=2688 <blockquote>

 Should life be based on some kind of time? Why? Why not just live according to one's body time? Time depends on current interest. If one needs to talk to people, than one likely should wake up with those people. If one's friends wake up at the same time as you, then the time of others does not matter.</blockquote>
 
 There are two factors in time. Personal interest and the sun.
 
 If one has a social life, one will wake up on a similar time with them.
 
 If one lives in a city, and enjoys being awake in accordance to others in the city, one wakes up with the city.
 
 If one has neither, one has no reason to wake up on time. He will just follow his own body and interests.
 
 If one sleeps outside, or in a place where sufficient sunlight exists, the heat may wake one up.
 
 If one sleeps in a place where noise exists during a certain period of time, one may wake up during that time.
 
 If one sleeps with people nearby, one may wake up with them.

 Heat is a sensual experience, and it causes one to do things. For one, to get something cold to drink or drink for homeostasis.
 
 Further, it sure does feel that heat causes action, maybe even a bit more instinctual.
 
 Some historians say that climate matters, scientists say it doesn't. Broadly thinking, Africa compared to Europe.
 
 I think the heat combined with the city has some detrimental effects.

 I believe in this thought, I meant lazy in not doing work toward current direction, that the heat was driving me to do other things.

You wonder, why was this made?
 
 Perhaps it existed since or before the Industrial Revolution. That's reasonable.
 
 Yet, there are tons of places in the world that follow those ancient designs. In India, China, Korea, and Taiwan there are rows of giant apartment buildings being built close together in random areas with no commercial buildings in sight.
 
 I usually just give them a bewildered look from a transportation vehicle: train in India, the Yunan airport entrance, a train in Taiwan, a bus in Korea, a bus in Japan. There's a scene in an Edward Yang film (Taipei Story?) where a guy looks out of an office window toward apartment buildings being built, also bewildered.
 
 Why anyone would want to live there, I am unsure. Do humans need housing that badly? Is a tent not enough? Can't one just buy a plot of land and build a nice little one story in the middle of nowhere? Property and its relation to humans is really complex, even more so in cities where some people have a choice.
 
 Science parks are similarly baffling and inhumane. Did the government team up with Rockefeller?
 
 How the heck do these old ideologies still exist? Was it just the image of American modern buildings that other governments envied and revolted by building their own Petronas Towers, alongside slums?
 
 The distance of modern architecture to romanticism is so far. 2690 2014-11-07 01:57:26 2014-11-07 06:57:26 open closed bland-apartment-buildings publish 0 0 post 0 Essays Thoughts Urban Philosophy _edit_last 1 Cultural Values of Households in Asia http://rahilpatel.com/blog/cultural-values-of-households-in-asia Fri, 07 Nov 2014 07:28:29 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=2692 a part of a thought after going to an uncle's house, after coming back to my parent's house in Virginia:
 <blockquote>
 10/2/2014
 ...The rich value large houses in farms, isolated from the city, in India and when they immigrate...</blockquote>
 
 Cultural values differ, and this is especially apparent and interesting in Asia.
 
 In Korea, Japan, sometimes in India, and sometimes in America (especially of young professionals), and probably much of the world, people with choice seem to value living a high-ride modern building in a city. More points for being near a body of water or close to downtown. More amenities, more points. The same logic applies to hotels.
 
 In India, people with choice value living in a large farmhouse with several servants.
 
 In Taiwan, a small house with a garden in a nice neighborhood is best. Not a bad ideal! The high-rises in 信義區 are a new phenomenon, perhaps influenced by the West.
 
 In America, some dream of living in a large house in the South where the land is cheap, not too different from the hippie's dream.
 
 From this, it seems people with choice have a tendency to isolate themselves from the city. Are the people on the street that hideous?
 
 What's really frightening is when those people with certain values of households immigrate to America. Indians who lived in farmhouses move to gated communities.
 
 Surprisingly, Chinese people do extremely well in creating their own towns on the outskirts of Western cities. No high rises. Some of the best street life that exists in America exist in Chinatowns. Well, I guess if these Chinese immigrants had money in their own country, they wouldn't have moved here. I've always lived near a Chinatown, and it may be because I value these people the most.
 
 I hope to move back to one those smaller apartments in the intellectual center of Taipei. 2692 2014-11-07 02:28:29 2014-11-07 07:28:29 open closed cultural-values-of-households-in-asia publish 0 0 post 0 Anthropology Thoughts Urban Philosophy _edit_last 1 The Suburbs Still Fail http://rahilpatel.com/blog/the-suburbs-still-fail Fri, 07 Nov 2014 10:29:07 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=2701 <blockquote>
 10/2
 People from the suburbs, like farms of any developed country, create knowledge from what's around. Even with the development of the internet, people still lack much knowledge.
 </blockquote>
 
 An interesting phenomenon.
 
 Even in the Information Age, the suburbs are still far from a progressive lifestyle. It is surprising how little has changed before and after the internet.
 
 Is it because the people have become accustomed to the society and lack action to change from it? What goes on in the mind of a person who lives in an older society when they experience media from a more modern one? What does America mean to an Indonesian? What does the city mean to a suburbanite? Just some distant society which has no affect on one's own?
 
 The most interesting observation is that people prioritize reality over media. Few people get ideas from media or other societies. Instead, it's what they experience in the reality of daily life form which they derive most of their knowledge.
 
 Is it prioritization of reality over media or a lack of will to take action toward a different society?
 
 For the most of the world, sadly, I imagine is the lack of free time to even think about it. In the suburbs of America, this is not the case.
 
 The suburbs are always a perplexing society.
 
 <blockquote>~2/14/13 to 8/6/13 in San Francisco the second time:

 The suburbs are conducive to laziness. The free-time is ill-used. 2701 2014-11-07 05:29:07 2014-11-07 10:29:07 open closed the-suburbs-still-fail publish 0 0 post 0 Thoughts _edit_last 1 Imitate Nature or Art http://rahilpatel.com/blog/imitate-nature-or-art Sat, 08 Nov 2014 07:22:54 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=2711 A thought sometime in Japan:

 Also going over thoughts in San Francisco and New York, it seems I consumed a lot of games, and used them as a basis for creativity. The results were not so good.
 
 This is a common thought of any artist, and I will answer that it is wrong. One can learn the aesthetic idea of other arts, but the <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/a-design-strategy-for-data">creation of it should be based on sensual input</a> from life, aka nature. 2711 2014-11-08 02:22:54 2014-11-08 07:22:54 open closed imitate-nature-or-art publish 0 0 post 0 Art Thoughts _edit_last 1 Social Determinism, Travel, and Aesthetics http://rahilpatel.com/blog/social-determinism-travel-and-aesthetics Sat, 08 Nov 2014 08:45:51 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=2716 a thought soon after moving from Japan to Taiwan:
 <blockquote>Consume more locally. You were into games in New York because that is what you consumed. In Taiwan, there are no games. Consume Taiwan -- life, travel, people. Do something with that.</blockquote>
 
 When one lives in the city, especially in hostels, where one interacts with the people one lives with, institutions of the city, and the general public, social determinism is likely more influential than media determinism[?].
 
 When I was in college, I thought it would have been great to make films or games, because I loved watching films and playing games. When I was in San Francisco, I was unable to build much interest because I was working most of the time. When I was in New York, I thought it was great to make games, though games played from the suburbs did influence, moreso, there was a scene if independent game developers in New York.
 
 When I began traveling, I kept these influences with me, for a very long period of time. When I travelled through Thailand, I wanted to document the gritty parts of Bangkok. When I was motorcycling slowly through northwest Thailand, I was thinking of game ideas and making small prototypes. When I travelled through Laos, I wanted to document tribal people's a la Vincent Moon, or just make films with them somehow. When I was in Vadodara, India, I had a friend come, and we were supposed to make a game, but we didn't. And at that time, I really felt no need to make games.
 
 In India, there was but only a small audience that could afford the leisure or device (iPhone, iPad) to play games, and an even smaller audience that would want to; There was more to life, it seemed. India was no place for the development for video games. Games sure, but not ones associated to expensive devices. How could I make something that a large portion of the world, one I was visibly surrounded by?
 
 Games had loss a bit of interest to me because of this, and I still haven't quite been able to recover interest to it. The ideal thought nagged: why would I bother making things that only a narrow audience could appreciate? (At the time I was more into pushing aesthetics of games, experimenting with mechanics.) Films made much more sense. Indians love Bollywood.
 
 My question, similar to Kevin Kelly's, What Does Technology Want, resulted in <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/information-media-and-education">this conclusion</a>.
 
 At a later point, I arrived to Taiwan. I had already been nearly a year before. At that time I had 9 days to explore Taipei. As I did in previous cities in East Asia, I searched out all forms of contemporary art. I found that the art institutions of Taipei were quite a bit behind Tokyo, and far behind New York, in aesthetics. The Digital Art Center just had a room full of videos playing. The Museum of Contemporary Arts had a mix of traditional medias. After quite an amazing exhibition at Tokyo's NTT ICC, Taipei disappointed, though I loved Taipei for a billion other reasons, and though far behind in the arts, I still would choose that country over New York as my ideal place to live.
 
 But finding people of similar interests proved difficult. If there aren't people who experienced new media, how could I pursue it? Should it be pursued?
 
 If it doesn't exist in the city, how can people experience it? I guess through the internet. But the country is a bit insular, in that people normally use Google in Chinese and likely look at arts in Beijing, which probably isn't bad.
 
 I believe my greatest failure in continuing the pursuit of arts was this: that I failed to educate others of the ideas that I experienced in New York to the people of Taipei. I didn't quite realize this at the time; I just didn't understand why no one else knew about those aesthetics, and my misunderstanding lead me to do other things.
 
 I found interest in Chinese, of course, because I wanted to talk to the people around me. That's the best example of social determinism one can have.
 
 So, instead of pursuing games and new media, I took Chinese classes and began Humans of Taiwan (a mix of wanting to talk to people and my fascination of the public), and continued with life.
 
 Though the internet exists, there are differences in knowledge of aesthetics. Taiwanese people have a rather high proficiency of English too, but they use their own Google and media world. Perhaps Ai Wei Wei leads them to more modern ideas. As aesthetics get closer to experience, one can't even experience certain aesthetics without living in proximity to a city of current art. <strong>Aesthetics is almost tied to location by social determination</strong>, and I frustrated myself in searching for people with similar knowledge and interests of aesthetics without knowing why. 2716 2014-11-08 03:45:51 2014-11-08 08:45:51 open closed social-determinism-travel-and-aesthetics publish 0 0 post 0 Aesthetics Art Philosophy Thoughts Travel _edit_last 1 The Ideal Neighborhood http://rahilpatel.com/blog/the-ideal-neighborhood Sat, 08 Nov 2014 07:47:06 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=2731 A thought soon after moving to Taiwan:
 <blockquote>Live in traditional area, work in city, as I did in San Francisco and New York.</blockquote>
 
 <blockquote>Everything can be done locally. The neighborhood is very important. The more traditional, the better. No commute. Just walk outside. It's beautiful.</blockquote>
 
 <blockquote>between 9/28/13 and 10/7/13:
 Live far from the city. In a residential, quiet area. Somewhere where it feels like Taiwan. Not a city.
 </blockquote>
 
 <blockquote>10/9/13
 Stick to high art and professional work, yet live locally, for inspiration.</blockquote>
 
 Households, especially in cities, depend on the area (unless one is really rich and not interested in people). If it didn't, everyone would live in rural areas in giant houses for a low amount.
 
 In my past, it seems I strived to live in a traditional area, yet have easy access to the city. Whatever their tradition is. This meant living in Chinatowns in San Francisco. I would have done the same for New York, but time was running. Chinatowns offered me cheap property, cheap groceries, cheap eats, a nearby park, and friendly people. In Taiwan, I lived next to a day / night market in the heart of the city. That's my ideal area, the simple pleasures in life: nature and cheap food.
 
 Even better, would be to have some kind of novelty. It being foreign. Something to draw inspiration from on a daily basis.
 
 That is, at least my first place of dwelling. After that I make friends. Soon, I find myself moving in with them. Then I make more friends, and soon, I find myself living closer to my closest friends.
 
 That leads to another ideal: to work with friends.
 
 <blockquote>10/10/13
 I'm quite scared of working. I think I just need friends to work with. That's all. I'm thinking too negative right now.</blockquote>
 
 Once one has achieved in living with with friends, then working with friends, then hopefully, they can all move together in the area of their choice. That is the order.
 
 It is a common false belief that one should live near their job. One's job shouldn't exist in an undesirable location. The choice in location reflects the choice of the company.
 
 <blockquote>>9/3/13
 I barely walk for an hour and I see no reason to go further. There is no goal. Nothing to see. No people to meet. I'd rather talk to the people at the fishing area, or just hang out within their proximity.</blockquote>
 
 An hour's walk is the max one goes to take a break, at least, in a city. So, it is important for the vicinity to have shared values. Only a strong interest (likely social) will pull a person further than one hour.
 
 <blockquote>9/16/13 in Osaka
 What place is best to live? In places where struggle exist I feel extremely creative. In places where there is no struggle, I can work for long hours, not thinking about the time that passes. Neither is good. I need to combine work and life, as I did in Seoul.</blockquote>
 
 <blockquote>We only think when confronted with a problem.
 - John Dewey</blockquote>
 
 The places on dwells directly affects the way one lives, and works (if one believes in social determinism, or wants to be part of society). Choosing a place to dwell should be based on what one wants to do. Cities provide communities, venues, school lectures, and more for artists. Developing countries with problems may sway one toward human rights and politics. Living in two contrasting societies can make one feel that the other is absurd.
 
 Creativity in cities can lead to furthering of aesthetics. My history clearly shows that I think of aesthetic ideas while living in a city where I consume contemporary art. Though, that may be from reacting to it. I do often think about high art in less developed places too, but it's greatly affected by the locality, perhaps using less technology and more local materials: local craftsmen, bamboo, food carts, natural landscapes.
 
 Creativity in developing countries, or any society other than one's own, also provides another perspective, <strong>which will shape what one creates</strong>. It forces the creator to be more mindful of the audience, resulting in a more universally appreciated art, one that works in their past society and current society, fitting for structuralism. It could have elements of traditional cultures, different political systems, different amounts of wealth. I feel Ai Wei Wei exceeds because of this. He can use craftsmen in China to create a massive piece, understanding their place on a human and political scale.
 
 Creativity in developing countries can also lead to practical applications, useful technology. In a developed country, technology seems to have passed the needs of humans. Each individual could live with 50 things or less. Living with less would increase the chance of creating something useful. If it is useful to someone with less, it is likely be useful to the rest.
 
 Therefore, I believe creating in a developing country may be better for artists, humanists, innovators, hippies, and, perhaps, anyone of age. With the internet, it is easy to catch up current sciences and aesthetics. Being a part of a human rights community would surely lead to more practical technology. If one has time, one can continue creating high aesthetic art with a unique perspective, likely more political. Though, it may be difficult without a community, such as those that exist in cities.
 
 <blockquote>>6/28/13 in Hong Kong:
 I'd rather live in a random town and work there. Build a community. Make personal art. Somewhere in east Asia, where the people are nice.</blockquote>
 
 The people have to be nice though, resulting in a more social, lively life, in which I am less likely to consume media.

 This was indeed a strange moment.
 
 I was in 萬華區 taking photos for Humans of Taiwan. It's the grittiest part of Taiwan. The metro exits into a park full of people. Many not even Taiwanese. It's visibly poorer, filthier, with an extremely high density of people.
 
 The past few days I did well in talking to people and taking pictures. This moment changed that. After talking to a few people and taking a picture, at some point I was unable to continue. I couldn't talk to some, or anyone anymore. My mind stopped forming Chinese sentences. Perhaps facing the poor caught up to me emotionally, and my care for them stopped me, from doing anything.
 
 I mean, what was I doing anyway? To them I am perceived as a tourist taking a photo with them, or a language student, taking a photo of them. Taiwanese people know how Taiwanese people are. Was I really gaining any unique insight into human nature?

 There's no point of even reading, audiobooks replace it, and further, audiobooks is able to give a gestalts, because one is simultaneously taking other sensorial input. A book in a comfortable place: home or at a cafe, provokes less thought with surroundings than say, listening to an audiobook while in a subway, walking, or at a party. Time is lost, and more importantly, social life time is lost.
 
 Update: After reading a bunch of books, there is a problem with audiobooks. It's a bit more difficult to read the table of contents and skim the contents of a book. Sliding through time is random. One can't simply skim to the first paragraph, or the first line of the next few paragraphs. Audiobooks need to be organized to have markers in time for chapters, and even mini-chapters.
 
 What I had written this post, I wasn't listening to audiobooks, I was listening to lecture series. Lectures are superior in audio form. It's less likely one will have to skim a lecture. I took notes on my phone via a text editor application through dropbox text files. These notes were the equivalent of underlining. Perhaps even better than writing on the sides of a book, because what I write creates a summary of each lecture. It also provided me a time to think and write in a different language. It feels closer to dialog. 2706 2014-11-15 10:07:59 2014-11-15 15:07:59 open closed reading-versus-listening publish 0 0 post 0 Communication Media Philosophy of Education _edit_last 1 Hippie Ethics http://rahilpatel.com/blog/hippie-ethics Mon, 10 Nov 2014 14:37:12 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=2713 a thought soon after Taiwan:
 <blockquote>I have no idea of what life is. Should I care for the less fortunate? Innovate? Live happily in a third world country? It seems all I can do is live. Spend less time in indecision and do as much as I can, while still taking the time to create.</blockquote>
 
 The ethics of a hippie is to create or be part of a good community who's values the hippie aligns with. This often comes in the form of a public space: an NGO, a progressive school, a hostel, a new school, a community center; It could also be in the form of a online organization. Values may include: advocation of human rights and equal rights and peace, minimal materials, time for creativity, diversity, be charitable, etc.
 
 The stereotyped ethics of a hippie, an artist, and intellectual are the same, just different in emphasis.
 
 Independent organizations whom have these values have risen thanks to the information age. DIY spaces, event spaces, workshops and lecture series, NGOs, are all at the edge of technology and modern values. Large institutions can't keep up.
 
 To me, it seems a good way to live is to live within one of these institutions, at the edge of technology and modern values. Spend time contributing to the community. And since I suffer from passions, to spend some time creating.
 
 These kinds of communities exist everywhere; Does it matter which one joins? Should it be one of the highest academia, in technology, art, values, and methods? What is the difference between an organization in New York and one in Nicaragua? In the information age, does it matter?
 
 New York is indeed at the forefront of intelligence, innovation, technology, aesthetic, and so on. It has several well-developed communities that cooperate to create powerful animals, which themselves cooperate to create more powerful animals, which eventually turn into a big apple.
 
 Nicaragua does not. One would have to rely on the internet and friends abroad to gain information. One would have to educate these ideas to the local. Modern art will not be appreciated by anyone. But to me, there are some really gripping pros: <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/imitate-nature-or-art" title="Imitate Nature or Art">the proximity of nature</a>, a new culture (which could prevent art from <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/universalism-in-art" title="Universalism in Art">becoming narrow</a>, or encapsulate the cultural characteristics), and <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/minimalism-ethics" title="Minimalism Ethics">minimalism</a>.
 
 Minimalism, I feel, is the greatest factor. Though it's very possible to live in New York with hippie ethics, it's easier to become distracted, disgusted, without creating a tiny space where one's mind can keep a more right social construct of the world. In Nicaragua, nature offers space which gives a feeling of freedom. To live in New York one needs strong will. To live in Nicaragua, it's less needed. This affects one's daily life, in the work one does and the things one creates.
 
 In creativity, I see two values. The first is to create for functionality from a minimalistic perspective. One is less likely to create something wasteful, and conversely, more useful to the people around, who may have a low human development, which has a higher chance of being useful to the rest of the world too (though they may have a more expensive technology that does the same). The second is to create for aesthetics from a minimalistic perspective. Again, One is less likely to waste money into the art object (this works well because there is no correlation between aesthetic and wealth), and conversely, more likely to use the materials around, which may lead to more creative products.
 
 [TODO: can argue more]
 
 I said Nicaragua, but personally, my dilemma was between New York and Taiwan. I love both, one The City the other the romantic ideal. Perhaps this was an attempt to rationalize my reasons to desire to live in both.
 
 Ways to do good in the modern world:
 diversify media
 diversify the ways people get media
 reverse propaganda / doctrine
 help individuals (human needs)
 create new / progressive schools
 - create new curriculums for them
 distribute wealth
 distribute labor
 work and or participate in a good community
 innovate for good* (functionally with new media, also satisfies creativity passion!)
 advocate good ideas (human rights, environmental, equality, etc.)
 create media art with good content
 create public art with good content
 utilitarian ethics
 educate
 document?
 and as always, help everyone around (family, friends, neighbors, local community, city communities)
 
 All of these things are worth doing, but even more, what has the greatest, lasting, effect on humans?
 
 Order of good deeds:
 politics
 academics and media
 academic and political relationships
 local relationships

 The idea of going home and being at home results in less action, and more likely to passively consume. This is because only one's housemates exist in the house, and media.

Audio seems to be quite undervalued, and often replaced by music. Though music is great, just think of how many audiobooks one could have listened to instead of music.
 
 A good example of the weirdness is in the film Of Gods and Men. Watching those monks sit and read all day is otherworldly. They abstain from the pleasure of talking! Compare that to a street in an Asian city.
 
 When living a less sedentary lifestyle, one gets into a habit of using more audio sources (audiobooks, lectures, radio, language courses) and using voice message apps (LINE? Perhaps all of the Asian communication apps) for communication. All of this, of course, simultaneously while doing something else with ones eyes and body.
 
 It feels as if the world was constructed around books, and now with technology, feels rather ancient.
 
 Perhaps in a future, instead of office buildings, people would just gather in public areas and do their work while walking around and talking; If it's cold, there could be a fireplace.

 Perhaps backpackers achieve getting closest to this. There are many who keep a list of items they have with totals often less than 50. (<a href="http://carrotquinn.com/2014/03/26/pct-2014-gear-list/">example</a>)
 
 After backpacking Asia for a long time, Kevin Kelly also tried to stick to these ethics. He went further. Trying to list what technologies were actually useful. As time goes, more products become obsolete, products become smaller, life is more convenient. The iPhone is a billion tools in one.

 To live a fully developed life, all one really needs is water, food, dwelling to protect from weather, a personal computer, an educated person to learn from, especially for younger years, a person educated in medicine with equipment.
 
 Therefore all the material items one needs are: a water filter, food (if grain is rice, then a pot and fire, or, a rice cooker), a personal computer, a tutor or parental figure (if young), and healthcare.

 The norm is is to keep relationships healthy via communication over the telephone, e-mail, and video-chat. I only talk communicate to people if they are physically near.
 
 If I live in a house in a suburb, then I am alone.
 
 If I live in a city, I have the people in the city.
 
 If I live in a house with several roommates, I will talk to those people more than more-valued relationships.
 
 If I live in another country, then I do not talk to the people in the last country.
 
 I believe I do this because I have no control of my social impulses. If someone is nearby, I talk. If there is a delicious piece of foodstuffs nearby, I eat it. It's not much different. It's a pleasure to talk, as it is to eat. The proximity of pleasures result in action. Perhaps that makes me <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/hedonism" title="Hedonism">hedonistic</a>.
 
 This trait alone causes destruction of relationships, makes me prone to <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/social-determinism" title="Social Determinism">social determinism</a>, and eventually leads to severe <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/adaptation" title="Adaptation">adaptation</a> to different societies.
 
 The only way to make me work is to put me in a work place. The only way to make me talk is to place me in a place filled with people. The only way for me to make art is to place me in a place where many people make art. The only way for me to work for charity is to place me in a place that requires charity.
 
 Sure, I make decisions, sometimes getting out of society and therefore escaping social determinism, but, for the most part, it seems my life has almost entirely depended on where I place myself. Therefore, <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/the-ideal-neighborhood" title="The Ideal Neighborhood">the placement</a> of myself is of utmost importance. 2918 2014-11-10 06:37:12 2014-11-10 11:37:12 open closed social-life-in-proximity publish 0 0 post 0 Psychology Schizoid Personality Disorder Thoughts _edit_last 1 Constant Progressive Action Ethics http://rahilpatel.com/blog/constant-progressive-action-ethics Tue, 11 Nov 2014 10:43:00 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=2956 <blockquote>11/17

 Often, when I say action in my thoughts, I mean, a thought that leads to me taking an action via my will in a way I feel that is progressive. Progress can be anything from finding something delicious to eat to helping a friend.

 Living and working, simultaneously, is something I feel I've been striving for my entire life.
 
 I feel that work life balance is different. It suggests that they are separate entities. I never feel that way.
 
 Some people can go to an office work, come out, then enjoy life with their family and friends. The work hard play hard lifestyle. I'm constantly trying to fit work in life. I have no hours. I just live.
 
 This is when I felt that computer programming is devoid of life. I spent most of the time in public places: outside, in a cafe, with friends, still it wasn't enough. I wasn't experiencing enough life. I filled the void with films. The only way to do a computer programming job is by having a steady workplace, at home with a family, or in place with friends.</blockquote>

 New experiences make time pass slow. While traveling I'm always experiencing something new.

Most work requires routine. Only the design stage is new. How will I be able to satisfy my hunger for the new while working?
 
 I think I did well working a few hours at night at hostels, but what about the day time when my brain was dead. Should I learn to do nothing, consume nothing? Is this okay?
 
 I need to live during my night hours. Stay outside, in a park, in a hostel. Keep living and working, even during off hours.</blockquote>
 
 Living and working is another way to word this ethics. To maximize life, strive toward goals, yet survive.
 
 Now, I think my conception of <em>work</em> for a long time was the office kind, sitting in front of a computer and doing work. That is what society conditioned me to think work is. That or my programming degree, I don't know. So I only felt I was doing work when I was working for a job or making a game. Did I not view everyone else's jobs as work? The service industry? I don't know. I'm just glad my conception of work has changed since then.

 When an artist creates something there are two directions, which can be combined: to further aesthetics and to further humanities. Humanities contains knowledge that can educate. Aesthetics has a method of transmitting knowledge that can provide a better means to educate. 2961 2014-11-11 05:57:30 2014-11-11 10:57:30 open closed aesthetics-versus-humanities-in-art publish 0 0 post 0 Aesthetics Art Communication Philosophy _edit_last 1 Film about Games http://rahilpatel.com/blog/film-about-games Tue, 11 Nov 2014 12:18:22 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=2965 I had a thought about making films about games.
 
 The first short film had the theme that games leads to actions more so than books. It had two classmates from New York, one Chinese, one Hispanic. The Chinese one more book'ish, the Hispanic less. It shows the life of each. Then, there is an incedent they both pass individually. The Hispanic kid acts upon it quite intelligently, using the nearby city to his advantage. The Chinese ignores it.
 
 I presented it to a local New York venue. I told them that perhaps I created them, and not games, because I grew up in the suburbs on film. That was my primary education. And somehow, I was stuck in the past.
 
 I showed them another film, the draft of one, to test. The film was about also about games. It showed how ideas were transmitted through experience of playing games. In the end of the film, the film reached the limits of it's medium in transmitting ideas. The end had a frame that displayed press start to continue playing. 2965 2014-11-11 07:18:22 2014-11-11 12:18:22 open closed film-about-games publish 0 0 post 0 Film Ideas Films _edit_last 1 Asceticism Ethics http://rahilpatel.com/blog/asceticism-ethics Sat, 15 Nov 2014 13:26:43 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=2971 <blockquote>

 I'm hijacking this old post for a newer set of ideals.
 
 todo: take from home page, todos / notes, and three months in Taipei
 <blockquote>9/16
 Choosing actions based on the gathering of knowledge.
 ...
 A constant progressive education.
 ...
 Leading to DIY spaces in cities, independent schools in less developed areas, hostels, public venues, open mics, hip cafes, central parks.
 
 These are spaces where diverse peoples converge, interact, share skills, experience together, share ideas.
 
 There is a distinction between public spaces with events with an underlying business purpose and those without
 
 What would the ideal space be?:
 
 Something between a progressive school and a DIY space? One where people can be themselves yet participate in classes.
 
 Mention modern schools in New York, The New School, and DIY spaces.</blockquote>
 It is indeed nice to see New York have many forms of public spaces: <a href="http://www.newschool.edu/">progressive schools</a>, <a href="http://babycastles.com/">DIY spaces</a>, public venues, <a href="http://flatironschool.com/">vocational schools</a>, and <a href="http://sfpc.io/">art schools not affected by wealth</a>.
 
 Why did the resurgence of vocational schools take so long? No one should spend four years to learn how to make a website. A single workshop could do that. And nearly every university fails to offer a good liberal education.
 
 That's what exists. Let's go back to nothing. What is the ideal public space?
 
 It would have the obvious characteristics:
 Everyone is welcome.
 Physically open most of the time
 Anyone can propose something.
 Easily accessible
 No underlying business directions
 No constraint in subjects*
 etc.
 
 If a space plans to have DIY stuff, then a building is required. Otherwise, a gazebo at a park would do.
 
 To keep it alive, there has to be someone there.
 
 To keep it growing, there has to be events.
 
 There is no end goal in a public space. Like a special non-evolving pokemon, it stays a public space.
 
 If a group of people find direction, it should not influence the entire space's direction; They are just a group of people in a space, which may do things (create projects). (Though it may help finances and grant-writing)
 
 [todo: need to think more]
 --
 
 *Is having no direction possible? A bunch of random mics or meetups often have no results. It will just die. Indeed a direction vs diversity problem. I'm optimistic. It has to be possible. It's entirely up to the people to collaborate and create. It just helps if there is a constraint. But the constraint shouldn't be on the entire space. Instead, just constrain events for creativity.
 
 Should people do work (full-time or temporary) at public spaces? Only if they contribute to the space enough? If it's a free space, like outdoors, then there's no stopping them.
 
 Spaces lack external stimuli. Perhaps meet-ups should alternate locations, or be in transit.
 
 Possible income for spaces in buildings: food (part restaurant!), drinks (part cafe?), sleep (part dormitory? hip travel services?), merchandise, commission whenever a person is hired from the space, door charge for events.

 aka Dean Moriarty ethics
 aka On The Road (film)
 
 <blockquote>a thought from the next day:
 I was thinking about the scene where Sal parts from Dean in New York, how their lives departed, one toward intellectual pleasures within society, the other, the same old kicks. Who’s life is better? Dean is more free, Sal is constricted to society. Dean struggles with money, Sal, maybe less so.</blockquote>
 
 I didn't mean to write a film review, I actually thought of Dean Moriarty.
 
 Are his ethics wrong?
 
 Dean is embodies <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/hedonism" title="Hedonism">hedonism</a>, yet, he is the main subject of interest. He leads Sal and other artists on adventures. He <em>is</em> the reason the book exists. He may have contributed to the electric Kool-aid experiment too. He continually experiments. He's <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/constant-action-ethics" title="Constant Action Ethics">constantly acting</a>. Though his actions and the consequences of his actions are uneven, he <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/hedonism-and-wisdom" title="Hedonism and Wisdom">learns more</a>, and acts with that knowledge.
 
 What's great about Dean is that he never settles, never gets old. He continues to explore. His understanding of the world and people is immense.
 
 I think Dean is able to bear fruit in experiments because his daily life involves the use of various skills and constant cognitive action. To take trains through America, work part-time jobs, understand modern aesthetics, understand current psyche, naturally leads to dissident thoughts, but it also leads to having great knowledge, and a great mind. A mind quite far from the <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/verbal-language-and-written-language" title="Verbal Language and Written Language">society shaped by written language</a>, yet living in the heart of society, New York. He is a genius inside the body of a working machine. Scientists should have been asking him for answers.
 
 I think of Dean because I was very close to being or even was Dean.
 
 What the difference between Dean and Christopher Doyle, Kevin Kelly, or any other hippie who's partial to the sensual nature of street cultures? Chris picked up a camera and Kevin picked up a pen? Maybe Dean just needed an outlet for creativity, to be taught how to channel his energy. He even asked Sal how to write.
 
 Dean isn't bad. If Dean didn't have kids or ditch friends, he'd be great.
 
 There are many Deans that live in cities, usually aged less than 35. They're not terrible people. For some people, a city is enough.
 
 
 
 
 Thoughts during watching:
 Perhaps can have the same experience as the book, in a much faster time.
 
 It already has a better gestalts. Books are so dead. Even if this film is inferior to the book, it's a faster way of gaining knowledge and experience.
 
 Third in jail, third in a pool hall, third in a public library. Not a bad division of time. Think, play, and learn.
 
 Mmm, same problem. One has to live to create. No one creates anything worthwhile while living in isolation, unless that person has experienced much. All that can be written is introspection.
 
 The characters live so much life, yet, they create so little, because their art form is so far from experience. Unlike Banky, who can create new art, object or experience, they are limited to writing. How ancient.
 
 Hmmm, picking cotton. Not much different from Woofing.
 
 Mmmm, dean can't stop living, even rather die than stop. "It's good to have a family, isn't it?"
 
 Haha, no care for the law.
 
 To life.
 
 The dance is great, hah.
 
 Dean gets angry whenever someone stops him.
 
 Hah, Ed Duncal marries for gas money. Such simple causation.
 
 Dean doesn't know the concept of responsibility.
 
 Hah, the daughter is so traditional.
 
 Only Sal sees the positive influences of Dean?
 
 Was benzadrine that popular?
 
 Marylou wants something normal. Normal being house, work, family.
 
 Hmm, this film is so old aesthetically. Can't compare to Hanneke, Farhadi, or other contemporaries.
 
 Hmm, Camille is the best actor. Similar to Melacholia.
 
 Mexico City is indeed heaven.
 
 And Dean ditches him.
 
 Hah, Sal's such a good boy.
 
 
 
 Reading Cassady's Wikipedia article:
 This is far more informative and real than the film. The facts are so much easier to determine a person. Father was an alcoholic, was on the streets of skid row, improsoned many times, was intelligent and helped by an educator who may have had sex with him, had several sex partners, one gay, 4 kids by two girls.
 
 His hedonistic ethics aren't too bad. He inspired a book, was far more interesting than anyone else. The only lawless thing is having kids and not supporting them. Which he eventually did.
 
 Hmmm, His wife divorced him to help him, but felt that was a mistake as the family was the last pillar of his self-esteem.
 
 "Twenty years of fast living but there's not much left"
 
 Hmmm, regrets his wild life, yet, the people around him love him.
 
 
 
 
 I googled up this analysis from gradesaver.
 of the parting scene and end:
 The close of the novel finds Sal beginning to settle down with a new love and a new life. Remi Boncoeur's offer to take Sal out on the town in a Cadillac suggests the alternative of a respectable, conventional life. But as Dean shows up with no other intention but to see Sal, Sal wrestles with the feelings of being torn between the two worlds. In the end, Dean cannot enter the Cadillac to go to the opera, just as Sal can no longer follow Dean on the road. Sal has made his choice. As Sal and Dean recede out of one another's vision, one might recall Paul Klee's Angelus Novus, the postmodern "angel of history" as described by Walter Benjamin. This figure has great resonance with Sal's experience.
 
 The novel ends with Sal contemplating the passage of time on a river in New Jersey. For Sal, no ultimate understanding of what "it" is has been accomplished. Sal finally understands that there is no such understanding except that of time moving by and people growing old and fading away. As for Dean, only his memory remains with Sal.
 
 of Mexico City:
 To Dean and Sal, Mexico seems to be the promised land that they were looking for on their many journeys. For Sal, Mexico represents the best way out of the conventional white American life. The beer and cigarettes are cheap, they can smoke huge amounts of dope, and they can visit whorehouses anytime they wish. All of this costs little money, and even more importantly, the police and the citizens of Mexico only watch, enthralled by the behavior, allowing it and encouraging it-perhaps because they are Americans. This culture has its own norms, and it is unclear why the travelers should be expected to worry about or even to know about conventional Mexican life.
 
 [Mmm, Taipei also has cheap vices. My vices are just simple pleasures: cheap food, tea, housing, and access to city and nature. But aren't those what everyone wants from a place they live in? The police in Taiwan also don't care, for different reasons, and it does make one feel more free, to be able to sleep anywhere, without a worry for crime. But Taiwanese people also live the same way, they'll sleep anywhere too, if they're tired, or if it's just too hot outside.]
 
 Sal and Dean seem to have no knowledge of Mexican culture and instead see the land around them only in terms of their own situation. The people's poverty, instead of a hardship, seems to be complete freedom. Just as with African American culture, Kerouac's characters again invert the traditional understanding of the repression of racial marginalization and poverty, instead presenting the life of these Mexican people as being gloriously free from the pressures of work and money that are experienced in America. For them, the primitive nature of Mexico is its best feature. Unlike their American journeys, Sal and Dean see their trip to Mexico as a trip to the source of life. Mexican culture seems not to have been touched or corrupted by modernity. In Mexico, there is nothing to run from or to. It is only a culture to be embraced because it seems to stand outside of time and history.
 
 [in Taiwan, it is also difficult to see the hardships, because people are so friendly. I still don't think much of it is hardship, as everyone is educated and fed well, perhaps more so than America. Of course they work, many doing service work, and when I asked them solemnly of they are happy, they said yes. I completely agree with the last sentence. Taiwan and perhaps Mexico are closer to life, as are other happier, island nations. There is a real discontent from developed countries, especially in the middle class. To be near people who are happier is all one really wants, isn't it?]
 
 The culture that Dean, Sal, and Stan experience in the mountains of Mexico stands outside of anything they have ever seen. Realizing that the road they are on is itself a modern construction just ten years old, however, Dean begins to understand that even wilder forms of life live beyond the highway. Yet, because they are still white American men, they may not be able to leave the highway to discover the Mexican subcultures. There remains a divide between what they want to experience and what they are able to experience. Sal despairs in his realization of what the road might mean for such seemingly pure cultures. He thinks about the invention of the atomic bomb, a symbol for the great destruction that modernity has brought, and despairs that one day the roads and bridges of culture will be destroyed along with the possibility of a pure and free existence.
 
 [Mmmm, adaptation is not so much a problem now. There are methods to learn a language easily. And culture too is not difficult to assimilate to.
 
 Where modernity is going is indeed uncertain, especially when one compare happier cultures. People live longer, but do they still live happily?] 3555 2014-11-14 05:34:03 2014-11-14 10:34:03 open closed i-think-of-dean-moriarty publish 0 0 post 0 Ethics Film Reviews Films _edit_last 1 _yoast_wpseo_content_score 30 _yoast_wpseo_primary_category Korea and The Apex of SPD http://rahilpatel.com/blog/korea-and-the-apex-of-spd Sat, 15 Nov 2014 15:38:02 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=1361 the height of travel

 When I flew from India to Hong Kong, I felt that I was on top of the world.
 
 I saw through Hong Kong. I explored it within a week. I found the most valuable artists there. I had little to no interest to it's culture. I was done with it.
 
 When I arrived in my high class hostel in Seoul, I felt the apex of Schizoid Personality Disorder (SPD).
 
 I could barely go to the bathroom without thinking about how much money was being wasted at the hostel. After being in India and Nepal for 3 months, then going to Hong Kong for a week, the amount of goods in Seoul felt ridiculous: spacious rooms, clean, free water, six lane roads, cars, tons of space, cafes, endless comfort.
 --
 
 It was probably the deepest feeling I had during all of my travels. I would be talking to myself at really high speeds. Questioning everything, material and human. It was as if I was re-constructing what society is in my head.
 
 I questioned why anyone could create anything. Life was far beyond a means a living, yet people moved to take action, perhaps toward some work, which I didn't understand.
 
 I think it's because Seoul feels like a sprawling suburb, and suburbs are still non-sensical to me. My mind couldn't figure out why anyone who act in such ways.

It sucks that I used a philosophic term. The woes of reading crap other people wrote. Anyway...
 
 Away from home it seems I live by a categorical imperative. I usually live in cities, or travel, and I rarely relax. I live 16 hour days, always doing something. That something may not make sense in hindsight, but at the time, it must have.
 
 If I don't take a break, actions increasingly become minute. Every action is thought of, every thought is thought of, and so on, to the point that I can't act. That's the <em>maximum categorical imperative</em>.
 --
 
 During the very end of years of travel (and often when traveling to a different society), I was approaching this maximum. At the end of my time in Taipei, I had a month of no work, so I just walked around, read, and thought a lot. I wasn't a part of society at that time.
 
 When I arrived in New York, I experienced absurdity. I was thrown into society via social obligations, and school. Both of which I chose long ago but wasn't prepared for. No action seemed right, except those required to live.
 
 My mind slowly made sense of the chaos; my brain on fire, trying to figure out what actions to take. Design for aesthetic? Design for practical? Why make media? Why not just act now, in the public, and directly influence people via public art objects or performances? But I was too slow to adapt, and really, I didn't want to. I had my own perspective, larger than New York, or so it felt. I had to postpone school, and New York. To continue school and stay there, I would have had to make sense of those actions first. But I couldn't. I couldn't make sense of how people could make trivial things with technology; I couldn't make sense of what one should make. I disliked the attachment of education to wealth. I felt the school environment restrictive, though thankfully it's in a great city from which to derive all inspiration. How do people make sense of everything?
 
 They don't. One just becomes accustomed to society without thought, and once in society for a long enough period of time, does not think about it.
 
 Coming from another country, recently experiencing a very active period of time, adapting would have required some time, and it did. I went home. And the change from maximum categorical imperative to automaton apathy took nearly three months. It takes three months of prison to destroy a person's will.

 The productivity of an artist is measured by the number of novel ideas executed over time.
 
 Banksy said it well:
 <blockquote>I use whatever it takes. Sometimes that just means drawing a moustache on a girl's face on some billboard, sometimes that means sweating for days over an intricate drawing. Efficiency is the key.</blockquote>
 
 <blockquote>Humans of New York and Vincent Moon have little to no design, or its all improvised. I like that. Less design, more work.</blockquote>
 
 These two people exemplify these ethics. They live and make a complete product daily, or nearly daily.
 
 Even more creative are those who directly affect others, like educators and good friends.
 
 Fluxus and Zack Gage also come to mind.
 
 When I arrived in New York to attend school, I felt there was no reason to create media, or use computers to do it. This led to ideas like <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/category/art-2/new-media">these</a>.
 
 Media is an unnecessary step, it felt. Why not directly affect people with public art? Heck, even writing the idea in words felt unnecessary. All I could do was draw the idea to convey it, putting the idea on to digital paper.
 
 My intentions were now more political, criticizing society, or shining light upon problems hidden in the artificiality of contemporary cities.
 
 The first goal of art was the political idea it conveyed. The second was how I used current technology to implement it. In that order.
 
 I wanted to disrupt society. I wanted to GPS track rats and post maps of rat pathways on top of subway maps. I wanted to show animals being slaughtered next to fried chicken shops. I wanted to show how bums are being kicked out of public parks by law enforcement for beautification purposes for the wealthy population. I wanted to reflect the twin tower lights on to windows of the offices of banks.
 
 Indeed, an emotional time. But also, perhaps, the greatest.
 --
 
 Another thought on these ethics. Following these ethics, one is constantly taking action, creating, something that is an accumulation of all the knowledge one currently has. As one gains more wisdom, the art objects or performances themselves become greater. The oldest people create some of the most knowledgeable art. I think of old filmmakers and writers who expound all of their knowledge into a single art object, their grand narrative, their language-game of life.
 
 I always find it difficult to take a break, read history, non-fiction, without actively creating.
 
 Why do that, when one can live a more progressive lifestyle, creating and learning simultaneously? 3036 2014-11-22 01:25:00 2014-11-22 06:25:00 open closed constant-art-ethics publish 0 0 post 0 Art Ethics _edit_last 1 Suburbs are Obsolete http://rahilpatel.com/blog/suburbs-are-obsolete Sat, 22 Nov 2014 06:26:33 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=3038

 <blockquote>11/21/14
 I read a bit of a tiny book on Descartes last night. He too created a philosophical doctrine out of nothing. He too spectated and then settled in a city with friendly people: Netherlands. One can't get away from people. But one can choose not to interact with them, and instead, just spectate, as a way to form one's own beliefs, without the opinion of others. Other people are death and life of creativity.</blockquote>
 
 To create a set of unique beliefs one must spend most of their time observing reality, for a long period of time. Despite it being the information age, travel and living is still the best method. Especially walking around cities, and sometimes traveling to suburban and rural areas.
 
 That is, until Google offers video footage of people walking in several parts of the world. Then one can have a Veidt style setup of a bunch of monitors playing the footage.
 
 It is on the edge where philosophy and humanistic thoughts begin. It's also where one creates their own ideals for societies, ethics, education, and art.
 
 Jane Jacobs knows urban planning because she lived in a city and spent a lot of time either observing or interacting with it.
 
 From the Wikipedia article on Lyotard about meta-narratives:
 <blockquote>Most famously, in La Condition postmoderne: Rapport sur le savoir (The Postmodern Condition: A Report on Knowledge) (1979), he proposes what he calls an extreme simplification of the "postmodern" as an 'incredulity towards meta-narratives'. These meta-narratives—sometimes 'grand narratives'—are grand, large-scale theories and philosophies of the world, such as the progress of history, the knowability of everything by science, and the possibility of absolute freedom. Lyotard argues that we have ceased to believe that narratives of this kind are adequate to represent and contain us all. He points out that no one seemed to agree on what, if anything, was real and everyone had their own perspective and story. We have become alert to difference, diversity, the incompatibility of our aspirations, beliefs and desires, and for that reason postmodernity is characterised by an abundance of micronarratives. For this concept Lyotard draws from the notion of 'language-games' found in the work of Ludwig Wittgenstein. Lyotard notes that it is based on mapping of society according to the concept of the language games.</blockquote>
 
 We all have language-games of history, mind, and society. It is best to create one less influenced by media. 3040 2014-11-22 01:33:21 2014-11-22 06:33:21 open closed living-on-the-edge-of-society-ethics publish 0 0 post 0 Ethics Philosophy _edit_last 1 Music and Inactivity http://rahilpatel.com/blog/music-and-inactivity Sat, 22 Nov 2014 06:43:40 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=3047 <blockquote>>9/3/13Music is what kept me working.

 This is wrong. One should constantly think (talking to oneself inside one's head) and/or consume, to stimulate brain, and increase chance for reaction.

 The combination of a human, performing, in public, is powerful.
 
 More powerful than any media. More powerful than any performance in an artificial environment.
 
 These are humans. They are performing. There is no place in society for them to act this way, or, they don't feel they belong to such a place in society, or, they simply want to perform directly toward humans, so they do it in the public.
 
 The most powerful effect is direct human interaction.

 From a good vantage point, the wedding is similar to those villages in Southeast Asia -- an unfamiliar social custom. This, even more inaccessible, as the village only requires going there whereas the hotel has a high cost.</blockquote>
 
 When I came back to America, society was even more absurd than those in traditional societies. It felt so far from nature, so artificial.
 
 In this particular case, attending an Indian wedding in America, really is non-sensical because it's a tradition transposed atop a different society.
 
 A decorated horse is replaced by an expensive car. Stealing shoes from the groom meant he had to walk back barefoot, in addition to losing a nice pair of wedding shoes; Now it's possible for the groom to either follow tradition and give money in exchange, or just wear another pair. Food cooked in large cauldrons rather cheaply from nearby farmers have been replaced by catering from an expensive restaurant.
 
 Traditions are fine. The influence of materialism is not. India is a really odd society in which the two mingle. Full of tradition and materialism, at least, in the upper classes. 3056 2014-11-22 21:45:20 2014-11-23 02:45:20 open closed adaptation publish 0 0 post 0 Social Philosophy Thoughts _edit_last 1 Absurdism http://rahilpatel.com/blog/absurdism Sun, 23 Nov 2014 02:48:55 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=3090 <blockquote>>9/3/13

 I believe these thoughts came to me when I went to Busan, then a hostel, then we drove together to a temple. Driving to a temple itself was already hypocritical. It's always odd to see tradition in a developed society, but here it seemed the contrast was even higher.
 
 It was odd to go to Japan and Korea and not be able to get the feeling of being transported to an ancient civilization. Both repaired or even rebuilt their temples to fit the wants of current society, perhaps for tourism.
 
 I'm told Juju island is basically a tourist attraction now.
 
 Japanese people have gardening down to an art. That is exemplary of shaping nature to human wants.
 
 Do these societies not appreciate the sublimity of nature? The rustic? The past?
 
 Contrarily, compared to my experience in suburban American, they seem more appreciative of nature.

 Human struggle is almost necessary for art. The way one struggles is different in the middle class suburbs and in the city.
 
 In the city, one can visibly see struggle on the streets, and of the many institutions one passes by.
 
 In the suburbs, it's more likely one will only see struggle through art.
 
 There is a difference in the potency of the affect because one is real and one is not. One should, if possible, see it visibly first, then rely on media, or else there will be a detachment of reality. 2724 2014-11-25 08:02:45 2014-11-25 13:02:45 open closed struggle-and-convenience publish 0 0 post 0 Media Mind and Matter Philosophy Thoughts _edit_last 1 Progressive Education http://rahilpatel.com/blog/progressive-education Sun, 23 Nov 2014 03:38:39 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=2752 <blockquote>9/12/13 in Busan

 If one a family, then I still think it should resemble a dream cafe, with more play space.

 Writing (and crafting) is a glitch of humans, often enabled by isolation. I should have never written anything. Only write to argue, which is, a weird form of talking.
 
 Even then, isn't it better to <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/constant-progressive-action-ethics" title="Constant Progressive Action Ethics"> constantly act </a> with what knowledge one has?
 
 Education is just the passing of immaterial knowledge, which can be gained through material (art objects, artificial) or through humans (talking, observing).
 
 If one does not stop to craft or write, knowledge still accumulates. There are only a few reasons to write, for documentation (history), aesthetic (literature, near dead), and to argue ideas (science and philosophy).
 
 I thought the process of writing would incite ideation of things I learned via non-verbal empiricism over the past few years. I thought that peering through my own repetitive scattered thoughts would lead to confirming of beliefs. Instead, it merely led to learning language. Though nice, I still consider it failure. This is because either, I didn't try hard enough to write (try arguing more, or writing a philosophic treatise!), or, that learning occurs when experiencing, writing not being considered an experience.
 
 I am still severely lacking ability to vocalize thoughts and ideas, but should it be limited to verbal language? As a person who grew up with film as an education, I could continue to live and create without knowing the words materialism, bad faith (Sartre's), and epicureanism, but knowing the ideas behind them. Of course, I would be able to speak and argue better, but my point is, it's not necessary. <strong>Conceptual metaphors do not require language</strong>. Perhaps <strong>this is my source of anti-intellectual air</strong>. I have no patience for words. Give me video. Frame it in a fun way. <strong>Perhaps this is where progressive artists and academia divide</strong>. Further, I feel <strong>it hinders creativity</strong>. Ideas can be created from materials, not just letters. Why use the words some philosopher or scientist used? Reading what others makes one prone to dogma. It's more memorable to create one's own words or references. Of course, contrarily, it hinder's one's ability to have modern conversation through written language.
 
 I think the only way to write is to write down thoughts, letters, speeches, and record conversations, while simultaneously experiencing. This way, written language is only used during experiential times. Looking back at thoughts is something one does at a very old age, or, if great enough, someone else will discover it and do the tedious work for you.

 From <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/i-still-dont-understand" title="I Still Don’t Understand">I Still Don't Understand</a>:
 
 <blockquote>After all this recent milling about via written language, I feel my gut was right all along. I knew everything I've written already. My convictions are the same as before. <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/no-more-writing" title="No more writing">Writing it down wasn't required.</a></blockquote>
 
 Now I'm starting to believe very few people have the linguistic ability to convey what they are actually thinking, and taking the time to verbalize (down to specific terms) is wasteful. People who live the most <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/i-think-of-dean-moriarty" title="I think of Dean Moriarty">active lives</a> are making decisions at lightning speed based on their current knowledge. People are decision-making machines. These people should be the subject of cognitive science. People live in a way so that they use the least amount of time explain a something, so they can continue taking action. If jargon suffices, why use a more specific term? A single word of jargon could have several meanings (conceptual metaphors). Watch any stand-up comedy; Count how many definitions of nigga there are.
 
 If it works, don't fix it. And what is meant there is, if having a small vocabulary works, why spend the time learning the words to apply to meanings (target domain?).
 
 Again, I feel this is a source of perceived anti-intellectualism, and where "street smart" divides from academia smart -- It's just difference in capacity of language. And being a person who has spend a lot of time in the streets, played video games, watched films, explored cities by the streets, who's friends similarly may be considered street-kids, hipster, hippies, or simply <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/conciseness-in-art">choose not to be wordy (a good virtue)</a>, I too suffer from having a low capacity of language.
 
 The con of this is losing access to knowledge, sometimes found in the form of giant books, though <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/information-media-and-education" title="Information, Media, Education, and Power">the world has now come a far way in media</a>, to enter modern conversation in science, history, and philosophy, it almost seems required. <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/a-personal-journey-through-books" title="A Personal Journey through Books">I personally suffered a huge learning curve in books</a>. What is the point of creating something so inaccessible? <strong>Is it the duty of an artist to make knowledge accessible?</strong>
 
 Well, I guess the knowledge has to come out somehow, and if it takes a big fat book to make an argument, so be it. But I highly doubt it's required, and I'm more certain that the concepts could be transmitted more efficiently in another form. I'm starting to now think that <strong>it is indeed the artists that make the world smarter, not the esoteric elite</strong>. The elite keep knowledge to themselves. The artist spreads the knowledge to the people. <strong>The best educators <em>are</em> artists</strong>, and, perhaps, vice versa.
 
 Even now, academia sit in offices in a university reading a pile of books. Someone once said history is best way to learn about human nature. I only half-agree. Nothing beats historical facts when studying politics, especially when compared to say, fictional art objects. Chomsky's life seems to involve reading a lot of books in MIT, then talking about it to interviewers. It worked for him. He's smart. But it's just one way. And reading history mostly limits things to politics. It entirely misses the sensual part of life, what people really think, which is where art comes in. But in a far more fun way, one could simply live; just walk around a city, look at things, and if one has time off, travel. Look at modern civilization, then look at less developed ones. Living a lot of life also can lead to a lot of knowledge, but it results in differences of how knowledge is obtained -- there's less words, and it's probably more sensually satisfying.
 
 Perhaps this is all a result of living a very lively life, then putting oneself into isolation. Such strong feelings for nomadic life, and against a sedentary life. 2987 2014-11-27 00:25:41 2014-11-27 05:25:41 open closed no-more-writing publish 0 0 post 0 Art Epistemology Literature Mind and Matter Philosophy Thoughts _edit_last 1 The Public is Stimulating http://rahilpatel.com/blog/the-public-is-stimulating Sun, 23 Nov 2014 08:19:47 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=3058 <blockquote>in Seoul:

 I feel that the less information there is, to a certain point, the less likely one will believe at face value, question it, and perhaps, react to it.
 
 Now, that there is so much information, it seems people have become more indifferent to media. Do Americans shrug at imperialism, knowing but not caring? Or is it the discontentment of failed urban planning and a failed government?
 
 I can't imagine solidarity in action similar to Taiwan and Hong Kong in America.

 I was somewhat interested in Japan due to games I played as a child, notably, Final Fantasy.

 The suburbs are deprived of life. It makes a good place for a child to learn through media. The difficulty of media studies is to relate it to reality. The more distance between the societies, the more power it takes to consider actions seriously, and critically think about. The more one is distanced from society, say the isolation provided by a house, the more one can see it as reality (huh? doesn't sound right). One can read the Iliad, but how many people think of that society as real? It is real. Read about wars in New Guinea from Jared Diamond and one will see that those ideas in The Iliad are real; It's a series of battles and rituals. But if one lives in the same society an entire life, it really is quite difficult.
 
 Media that adheres to realism are the best because they mirror human nature. Realist artists such as Tolstoy and Ozu are classic because of this characteristic.
 
 Documentaries are good too, but difficult to display in a structure as aesthetically appealing as fiction.
 
 
 
 <blockquote>>6/28/13 in Hong Kong:
 It doesn't make sense to watch movies while traveling. I’d rather spend time living. Talking to people, exploring.</blockquote>
 
 Conversely, it is very difficult to experience media while living a very active life. During my two years away from America, I watched perhaps a handful of films, read no books, listening mostly to local music. It didn't make sense to consume media, novelty was a walk away, experience could be created within the vicinity. I felt all media was so far from reality there was no reason ever to watch a film. I just kept thinking of what the director was doing to make the film. It led me to only care about experience-related art -- public games, new media, and performances.
 
 At the end of travels, I was able to consume philosophy and non-fiction, because then there was no acting, and the knowledge was more direct.
 
 
 
 <blockquote>8/3/14
 A thought after listening to today's lecture going in to post-modernism.
 
 It is indeed scary that people cannot differentiate reality from media. That their favorite icons are not their real friends.
 
 And perhaps that is what scares me about America. I am highly adaptable. If I live in America, I live a post-modern life, consuming more film than reality. I see the poor in films, not in reality. If I live in Asia, I live a traditional life. I am attached to reality. I see the poor in real life, media doesn't affect me, and often, I don't want to consume media because life is more valuable.
 
 Perhaps it's a matter of age. One should consume media because one can learn a lot, and quick, quicker than teachers can teach. But later in life, one must detach from media and stay connected with the world, only consuming reality, non-fiction.</blockquote>
 
 Media studies is a great education, but should be done in a lively environment.
 
 <blockquote>To not react to the world is to die? No, it's introspection. One has built up so many reactions in ones life, one is able to think, even without external stimulus. Only a newborn who has no external stimulus will know nothing.
 
 What's the difference in growing up in a post modern society and a traditional one? The knowledge gained is the same. The difference is that people in a post modern world are unable to differentiate what's real and what's media.</blockquote>
 
 It's much harder to reacty impulsively to media.
 
 <blockquote>8/9/14
 Media really is the only outlet to the suburbs. Films served as a telescope to the world.

 One that contains knowledge
 One that directly affects humans via physical interaction.
 One that is social
 One that is beautiful
 
 These are also forms of pleasure.
 
 Physical interaction can be satisfied without manmade objects; The sublimity of nature is enough. So is eating and exercise.
 
 In another view:
 One that affects the mind, and
 One that affects the body
 
 The potency of art depends on the potency of the characteristics of the art and the audience. A more sensual art more strongly affects a more sensual person. A more mindful art more strongly affects a more rational person more. Beautiful and social arts affects everyone.
 
 The more potent, the greater chance of reacting to it.
 
 If social, potency, and therefore chance of reacting, is multiplied.
 
 Hmm, is a social experience the end?
 
 Or the beginning of another?

 Simply, if one human is having a problem, without another within vicinity, how will that person get over it?
 
 Densely populated areas feel safe because there are more people. More people more justice.
 
 More desolate areas allow have more space between people and less light. Both of which attract petty crimes.
 
 Favelas are populated, yet have crimes.
 
 Are those crimes only restricted to dark alleys and unlit pathways?

 Another thought.
 
 If one grows in a house where one is accustomed to lock the door, turn on lights at night, come home before night, never walk alone, never go out without a car, a fear to go out, and perhaps a fear to meet people ("strangers") could develop.

 Another.
 
 The lack of crime in East Asia is factor of freedom. One doesn't worry about where they are, how, or when they will get home. Sleeping outside is a viable option.
 
 I can't say the same for America, especially suburban America, even after traveling.
 
 I had a more positive view during my nights in New York after travel, but there's still a bit of insecurity.
 
 When I came back to New York, I decided, out of exhaustion, convenience, and change in cost of living, to sleep in Washington Square park. There were a few bums playing music and a few drunk university kids enjoying it, both equally harmless. Later there were just drunk university kids. I believe, the bums were cleared out by the police (I've seen them clearing bums out on a different day).
 
 Over-policing cause the bums to continually move toward other covers from wind for warmth: under bridges, in subways stations, in underpasses. An unfortunate migratory pattern.
 
 From my experience in East Asia, I did not see this. A homeless person, and even people with homes -- a drunk university kid, and a businessman, could sleep in a public park. They appear quite alright, perhaps tired from the world, but unagitated.
 
 <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/homeless-asians" title="Homeless Asians">Homeless Asians are special</a>, especially so when seen in the developed world.
 
 Property is a concept I struggle to understand. To pay an enormous amount of money for space above earth. Does this directly derive from slave and slave-masters? Shouldn't this concept be dead in the Information Age? [todo: read Debt: The First 5000 Years]
 
 Even after much travels, the place I fear the most is where I am now: a large house in a gated community.

 Homeless East Asians are special. Testaments of the crime-less, thrifty ethics of East Asians; Modest modern scavengers of urban waste a la recyclables, they fertilize the city's sidewalks every night, take care of the city like under-appreciated mothers do their shit-spewing babies.
 
 I've always had a fascination with bums since I first moved to a city. A fascination for the human condition perhaps. They are incredible beings.
 
 The Asian kind, especially. I feel no difference between the Asian recycling ladies of New York and certain night market vendors of Taipei whom clean the streets every night. Perhaps they are the same. I walk down the streets with them, comforted by their presence, inspired.
 
 Wherever I settle, I hope they are always near. 3244 2014-11-25 06:58:11 2014-11-25 11:58:11 open closed homeless-asians publish 0 0 post 0 Essays Literature Social Philosophy Thoughts Urban Philosophy _edit_last 1 Reading and Listening to eBooks http://rahilpatel.com/blog/reading-and-listening-to-ebooks Wed, 26 Nov 2014 06:12:35 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=3302 After listening to a great lecture series on philosophy from The Great Courses, I thought listening to lectures and books (with the addition of films and games) <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/the-obsolescence-of-literature-and-the-future-of-education">surely replaced the ancient knowledge transmission through reading</a>. And for the most part, I agree.
 
 But there are still quite a few books I'd like to read, and in the Information Age, it seems the methods to get them are contrarily not so simple. Furthermore if one wanted to do research, then going to the library or building a personal one still seems the best way. Skimming through a bunch of eBooks sucks.
 
 Recently, I bought a Kindle. It's beautiful, but just too slow, I was unable to gauge the content of a books. It may be okay for literature, where one is likely to read the thing entirely, but for knowledge, research, or just general playful reading, it's useless. I returned it, and instead ordered an iPad Mini.
 
 The Kindle app for iOS is free, but the library can be expensive, and sometimes, the format is inferior to the actual book, missing pictures or linkable items.
 
 Then I read somewhere that some eBook readers can link to Dropbox to read eBooks. Great! Then I found <strong>Voice Dream Reader</strong>. It is the best application I've found to read AND listen to eBooks. The application excels because both options are available simultaneously; The text being read is highlighted, and one can start and stop audio at any point in the text. This makes it superior to audiobooks, the Kindle, and real books. With audiobooks, one can't gauge the contents, and skimming is fruitful, especially without any sort of markers (future feature of audio books?). Another great feat is that it keeps the original format and can convert the format on the fly to a more readable version similar to Kindle. The original formatting is nearly always superior, even if it doesn't quite fit on the iPhone screen. The only time to use the readable version is for long-form reading, or passive reading of fiction. Lastly, it is superior to actual books because it offers the ability to provide audio, freeing the eyes.
 
 The app has a slew of options and is quite customizable. It handles epub, PDF, and word documents (no Kindle formats though). The voice is pretty darn good, I feel happy at 250 to 300 words / minutes; Any slower and my mind wonders. There's highlighting and notes, which is kind of a pain on iPhone because the text is so small, but perhaps better on iPad. Like the Kindle, one can highlight words and search it in a dictionary or wikipedia. It is indeed a dream. I can choose books from dropbox, skim through the original format like a Wikipedia article, begin listening to any part of it, or read it like a Kindle.
 
 Though this is the best way I've found to read eBooks, I still find it inferior to a public or a personal library of books, but not by much. I used the Mac Kindle application to read The 21st Century Backpacker's Bible because it was free on Kindle Unlimited (free for one month). I used Voice Dream Reader on iPhone to read some of Debt: The First 5000 years. I still haven't received the iPad mini yet.
 
 It's still quite painful to find ePubs or PDFs. There a quite a bunch of online bookstores, free and not. Googling seems to be the best way to cover them all. Thankfully having access to Dropbox makes organization painless.
 
 <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/nomadism-culture-and-the-playful-quest-for-knowledge">eBooks are important to me as I can't have any books while traveling</a>, they just weigh too much. Furthermore, from my experience in libraries and bookshops in Taipei, most selections are translated to Chinese. My goal was to devise a method of reading and listening while traveling, and it seems an eBook reader <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/a-liberal-arts-self-study-curriculum">in conjunction of other medias</a>, is the way to go. 3302 2014-11-26 01:12:35 2014-11-26 06:12:35 open closed reading-and-listening-to-ebooks publish 0 0 post 0 Literature Media Philosophy of Technology Travel _wp_old_slug ebooks _edit_last 1 Creativity as Organization from Chaos http://rahilpatel.com/blog/creativity-as-organization-from-chaos Wed, 26 Nov 2014 08:55:14 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=3319 The further one is from society, the more disorganized the world appears.

 It is the distance between disorganization and organization that determines the level of aesthetic beauty.
 
 It is up to the mind to organize chaos.

Cities are the most potent area of human organization. One needs distance, surround oneself with less common materials, then create. It will also lead to a more creatively efficient lifestyle, as the mind struggle to piece together the world into new designs and ideas.
 
 It used to be in order to have social connections, display work, one had to live in cities. With the internet, it is no more.

 During certain points in travel I came with these ideas:
 A public vending machine for barter. The machine allows a user to place one item inside and take one item out.
 
 GPS track a pigeon and/or a dancer to get flight pattern data for a robotic dodo bird.
 
 A film that contains video footage of a GoPro camera traveling around Taiwan, using JRPG music to fit the natural and artificial settings.
 
 A film from real video footage of animals in the jungle to display high culture ideas of humans.
 
 Live robot exhibition. I am the robot. The robot moves depending on interaction (touch, possibly other senses) according to a set if rules. There is a pattern to find. The winner gets a candy.
 
 An art installation dealing with video game memory cards.
 
 A multi-player game installation in which the game installations are physically separated, but have a map to one other installation.
 
 A smartphone application that allows users to create things in real space, allowing people to interact with a digital world atop a real one.

 update from 8/25/2015:
 Organizing materials into different forms does indeed seem to define creativity. It's the artistic version of materials science. It's not about organizing a functional world. It's about organizing a vision. 3319 2014-11-26 03:55:14 2014-11-26 08:55:14 open closed creativity-as-organization-from-chaos publish 0 0 post 0 Aesthetics Mind and Matter Philosophy Thoughts _edit_last 1 艾未未：道歉你妹 (Ai Wei Wei: Never Sorry) http://rahilpatel.com/blog/ai-wei-wei-never-sorry Fri, 28 Nov 2014 10:08:55 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=3463 This is a review of my thoughts during the viewing of the film.
 
 他也有被遺棄的工廠。
 <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/living-on-the-edge-of-society-ethics" title="Living on the Edge of Society Ethics">Living on the edge of society</a> to create art. People who are closer to or are idealists must live on the edge of society for their mind to be able to maintain such ideas. Living inside of a city doesn't allow the space to think such a way. There are so many ideas in cities that are different than one's utopia that one must step back, or in this case, out.
 
 在奧林匹克的時候他感覺他做不好的東西。他的作品換新中國的政治學，他知道後果。
 I think this point was pivotal for him. He came out of college in New York with design and art on his mind. He participates in a grand project. But aware of the consequences, he became more political after this point.
 
 他每天寫博客。
 For the sake of confirming beliefs or dissident documentary? Looks like there's a book that contains his blog from MIT Press now.
 
 如果藝術人沒做事，他寫事。
 Seems common of any artist. One has to keep creating! But any other form of art is superior to writing. He did well in New York, meeting people, creating exhibitions. Perhaps it is best to be part of society.
 
 「一共的做事。」
 Solidarity. Do something that is right and people will follow.
 
 「不是藝術的關係，是每一個人的關係」。
 More solidarity. It's interesting to try to find a point where political art divides into art and politics. Many artists act with great political knowledge.
 
 他用了博客跟紀錄片記錄事。
 Using the blog as a documentary tool. And later, Twitter, which enabled social gatherings.
 
 「網路有力，因為給人機會改變人的意見。」
 The internet enables common people to change the opinion of people.
 
 It's interesting that people didn't use the internet to simply gain knowledge, say reading Wikipedia, instead rely on artists to feed the information to them in a more amusing form. One could easily read the Wikipedia article of the earthquakes in a minute, but it took an hour-long documentary to shove the same information in the minds of people. Though, I'm one of those people. Is it the pathos? Is it because film as a medium offers more information (visual data)? <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/information-media-and-education" title="Information, Media, and Education">The closer to real experience, the more powerful the reaction</a>.
 
 藝術是今天的語言。*
 Art is modern language. This was quite profound to me. <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/social-determinism-travel-and-aesthetics" title="Social Determinism, Travel, and Aesthetics">I struggled in the past having learned art in New York and then being unable to talk about art in other countries</a>. I will talk more about this when he moves from New York to China.
 
 At another point he upholds the common view art is communication. Artists communicate by creating art. It is just a form of communication, like written, verbal, and body languages.
 
 Why does it take a modern artist to be listened to? So many say and write the same things a modern artist says, yet the modern artist gains the power and attention. From Tate to a person with several followers. Again, the artist's form of communication is more powerful than data. The experience of reading 5000 people are dead in a paper is different from walking around 5000 dead bodies.
 
 If art is a way more powerful way of communicating, then it may be true that an artist who constantly creates art is more influential than one who does not.
 
 「你得表現批判。」* 看的好容易。
 By simply documenting the simple, rational actions he took, he makes strong criticism of society.
 
 得開始理想的社會。*
 ...
 他說他是永恆樂天派。
 ...
 他只要教人。
 He's very ideal. I think one has to construct an utopia, then try to shape reality toward it. It's a conscious effort among those with sufficient knowledge. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavoj_%C5%BDi%C5%BEek#Ontology.2C_ideology.2C_and_the_Real">But it seems that the creation of art is kind of unconscious</a>.
 
 In his reactions to police and reporters, he acts no different than as if it were a friend. He behaves as if he would in his own house, and expects others to do so too.
 
 He even later says he's an "eternal optimist". He feels positive changes are possible and happening.
 
 He just wants to teach people. The world is his students. In his documentaries people refer to him as 艾老師, Ai teacher. It's a fundamental desire to want to teach people.
 
 他也愛紐約。
 :). It seems New York served as a place of freedom for him.
 
 自由很怪。經歷自由你不可能忘了。個人非常強，比較國家強。
 It seems quite true in his life; After New York he has never acted anything close to a slave.
 
 在紐約他十二的年做難。
 He even worked at Second Avenue Deli!. He must have spent quite a bit of time exploring those streets. Oh man, now I want to go back to a city!
 
 他抗議，也看了Iran的審訊。
 Learning from contemporary history in a progressive manner.
 
 中國沒有藝術。
 ...
 如果沒有人做藝術，你得創造藝術的社會。 總是有藝術人。你得跟他們說話，較。
 He struggled going back to China because there was no modern art, especially not near modern as New York. But artists exist everywhere. One just needs to create a community, and they will come. One needs to educate them, then continue talking about it.
 
 Now that there's internet, it would seem that this is a moot point, but it is not. In my experience, many countries still uphold very traditional arts, which is promulgated by universities, which itself is likely promulgated by government. Even now in Taiwan there are universities that hold traditional arts higher than contemporary. Though, that is not a criticism of Taiwan, as it has only recently been lifted from martial law.
 
 Whereas Ai was able to create a community and continue creating the way he did in New York, I was unable to create a community of the art I enjoyed (games), and instead diverting my attention toward more universally appreciated modern arts (HONY). I did this because <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/constant-art-ethics" title="Constant Art Ethics">I couldn't stop I had to keep taking action with the knowledge I had</a>. I had to keep creating, and consuming, and the people around me must be able to understand it. Why spend the time to educate people people on modern art? I could have gone back to New York, or they could use the internet to see it. I didn't understand why Asia's aesthetics were so far behind the experimental communities of New York.
 
 "Why spend the time to educate people people on modern art?" is a good question. Is <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/learning-the-aesthetics-of-art" title="Learning the Aesthetics of Art">knowledge of aesthetics</a> necessary to create something new? No. I often feel that if one doesn't know what modern art is, one is likely going to be even more creative. Though, from my experience, I don't remember any time where I saw an amazing art by a person away from modern society. The concepts are ancient: writing, painting, crafting, plays. Though, traditional games are awesome.
 
 「藝術是方法發展新的意見。 是藝術人的職責保護。」
 "Art is a way of developing new ideas." I think he meant, art is a way of expressing idea, as opposed to developing new aesthetics.
 
 "It is up to artists to protect freedom of expression." That makes sense. Artists need to express themselves, and if they encounter a situation where they can't, they fight for it. 3463 2014-11-28 05:08:55 2014-11-28 10:08:55 open closed ai-wei-wei-never-sorry publish 0 0 post 0 Film Reviews Films _edit_last 1 The Future of Art http://rahilpatel.com/blog/the-future-of-art Thu, 27 Nov 2014 17:00:30 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=3483 Is in machines. 3483 2014-11-27 12:00:30 2014-11-27 17:00:30 open closed the-future-of-art publish 0 0 post 0 Art _edit_last 1 I Still Don't Understand http://rahilpatel.com/blog/i-still-dont-understand Thu, 27 Nov 2014 05:01:24 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=3572 Perhaps another thought of the decision between New York and away from the developed world.
 
 More likely, quite possible this feeling of inaction is merely a reaction of being cooped up at my parent's house in the cold winter. <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/the-effects-of-weather" title="The Effects of Weather">I hate the cold</a>.
 
 It should be up to society, not just education, to channel people, at all levels, toward taking ethically satisfactory actions.
 
 To live in a society where one has to constantly, consciously and unconsciously, make decisions to avoid doing wrong, especially in simple daily actions such as buying food and discarding trash, to ignore indoctrination and propaganda, obvious or not, is the result of a failed society.
 
 All nations suffer from these things. No nation is pristine; Shit is prevalent.
 
 Yet, because less developed societies are just that, the problems are less developed too. Government may be corrupted, but people at least know what they're eating, drinking, where their trash is going, how their dwelling was made, who their children's teachers are, have less equality problems, and can afford and/or have free emergency healthcare. Also, with less money, there's less chance of government committing large-scale wrongdoing such as imperialistic wars.
 
 The intelligent people of developed countries create independent communities, make the right decisions, advocates these decisions, but it all seems for sake of unraveling a society that developed so far into the wrong side of the spectrum, that if one steps back, the changes are minute.
 
 What keep these [intelligent, privileged] people seated is their love for the people. Jon Stewart loves New York, and America, and somehow, it's become his duty to deflate TV propaganda. <strong>Every community in New York is based on a love of the people; It has nothing to do with the country</strong> (save the Constitution). These people will exist, as they do all over the world, no matter what society they are in. They're educated and developed their own values in society. They often have no ties with the government and resist it, form NGOs, or other <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/the-ideal-public-space" title="The Ideal Public Space">public spaces</a>, and do good in their own way. It may seem anarchist, but it's natural.
 
 What is one to do? Activism. If Chomsky is right, as long as the nation is persistent, it should work.
 
 A personal question, perhaps self-interested, is it wrong to move elsewhere? Let the developed society collapse [todo: read How Societies Collapse]. One wouldn't have to deal with as much indoctrination or propaganda, and, of great influence, one wouldn't feel they are contributing to the downward progress of society. Instead of undoing a backward society, one would be progressing a less developed society, hopefully closer to a better direction.
 
 During my travels I rarely felt I made ethically poor decisions. Perhaps air travel was the worst feeling (why can't I sit in a baggage compartment?), and the random expensive hipster cafes. Otherwise it was merely giving money to small restaurants and hostels. The money could have gone to better places, but I also could see exactly where it was going, and those people were nice.
 
 To move elsewhere requires one to either detach from friends and family (not bad with technology) or try to sway more to move together. Luckily, I haven't quite settled anywhere, but I would still only be able to communicate to family via technology, and a person who <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/social-life-in-proximity" title="Social Life in Proximity">communicates in proximity</a>, that's a problem.
 
 I think I mentioned before that, when coming from Taiwan to New York, <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/adaptation" title="Adaptation">I had trouble</a> coming to terms with what the artificial meant, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7954936-what-technology-wants">what technology wants</a>, and <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/information-media-and-education" title="Information, Media, Education, and Power">what media wants</a>. And after much time, I still don't understand. And until I do, I kind of feel I don't want to be a part of it [developed world].
 
 It just doesn't make sense. <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/creativity-as-organization-from-chaos" title="Creativity as Organization from Chaos">I've even felt that living elsewhere has a positive influence on creativity</a>.
 
 After all this recent milling about via written language, I feel my gut was right all along. I knew everything I've written already. My convictions are the same as before. <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/no-more-writing" title="No more writing">Writing it down wasn't required.</a> 3572 2014-11-27 00:01:24 2014-11-27 05:01:24 open closed i-still-dont-understand publish 0 0 post 0 Personal Thoughts _wp_old_slug 3572 _edit_last 1 Consistent Play Ethics http://rahilpatel.com/blog/consistent-play-ethics Sat, 29 Nov 2014 00:13:24 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=3527 <blockquote>~2/14/13 to 8/6/13 in San Francisco the second time:

 [todo: way too long, accumulates several ideas, need to clean up.]
 
 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Still_Walking_%28film%29">When one is away from their home, forced to be in a place they don't want be in</a>, one becomes homesick.
 
 An artist's home often isn't just a dwelling. It's a community, which could be in the form of a group of people, a city, a country, or even the world. It's a place where one feels the urge to take action. The artist belongs in an active place, and desires it, though breaks may be needed (or breakdowns if one fails to take a break).
 
 Now, away from a home and in isolation for nearly half a year, I can hear two: New York and Taiwan.
 
 Since my stays in both of them, they've been on my mind, as a place I tell myself that I'm going to come back to.
 
 From personal experience, I know the environment affects me greatly. Whether that's a lack of willpower or responsibilities doesn't matter. It affects my social construction of the world and what I do -- for work and art. Therefore, the choice in environment is the greatest.
 
 In <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/searching-for-the-greatest-environment-ethics" title="Searching for the Greatest Environment Ethics">Searching for the Greatest Environment Ethics</a>, I came to the conclusion that:
 <blockquote>A single small community is exclusive (the reason for my apathy of college towns). The community must be inclusive. A community of communities, including public interaction — a city, or even a country.</blockquote>
 An inclusive city or country is better than an exclusive institution.

 <blockquote>Does America consume more media than the rest of the world? Especially compared to social nations such as those in South East Asia and Taiwan?</blockquote>
 
 I don't think so. Taiwanese people consume a lot of media too. But the way they consume it is different. They do it while living a very lively life, and use their phones to watch television or movies. I've only seen old people sit at home and watch television. This contrasts greatly with the suburbs, where media is consumed solely.
 
 <blockquote>All one needs is a few good relationships, creative ones, and both would work.</blockquote>
 
 Now I begin to question this, is a few good relationships really enough to make up for the deficit of good characteristics of the environment?

 <blockquote>In East Asia, it didn’t matter where I slept; There’s no crime there. I’d sleep when I was tired, or at a friend’s house, or at a park. It cut commute time.
 
 In Taiwan, it didn’t matter where I ate. The food was cheap enough to eat anywhere. There was no reason to go home. I could eat, sleep, work, anywhere. Absolute freedom.</blockquote>
 
 Though I feel quite confident in nearly every part of the world, there is a bit more freedom felt when crime does not exist. As a night person who enjoys the company of people awake at night, or just strolling around at night, this is much appreciated. It enables me to stay active day and night, regardless of when I am awake.
 
 Though I could live with a box of cereal and some fresh fruit in my backpack, the prevalence of cheap food allows me to worry about one less thing. And this thing is important as it's required for survival. It being delicious and healthy are extra.
 
 <blockquote>Public Places as a Savior from Commoditization:
 Public places in cities I think are closely associated to freedom. The sense of freedom gets lost in social norms of the artificial. People are conditioned to sleep at home, cook and eat at home, work in offices, and work more at home or at a cafe, leaving bars as the only place to socialize. This is the result of commoditization, people feel (and often do) that they have to pay to use a computer, pay to rent a book or dvd, pay to sleep, pay a cafe to use the internet, pay to park, pay to sleep, pay to travel, pay to pitch a tent, pay to drink water, pay to wash clothes. Without a healthy street life, worse, in the suburbs, it’s possible that people live without knowing they could actually meet friends at a park, have a barbecue, and enjoy.</blockquote>
 
 Though I've become quite resistant toward commodities and an adherant of <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/minimalism-ethics" title="Minimalism Ethics">minimalism ethics</a>, I fear that over time that it may be possible to recondition my mind toward more capitalistic behavior.
 
 During my short time in New York, just by following the belief of not eating out alienated me of several chances of social interaction.
 
 I neither wanted to be inside of a building in front of a screen or inside another building paying for something to do something. I just spent the time in the public, talking, thinking of ideas based on time in the public. And they were some of my best ideas, I felt. It was just a simple matter of thinking of design philosophy and walking around.
 
 The law of America felt restraining too. I watched bums gets kicked out of parks. And it showed too, in the ways people acted in society. Not just refraining from doing unlawful things, but in taking several extra unnecessary actions in daily life (todo: see if i can find examples in thoughts).
 
 I usually feel the freedom of New York only half of the time. Sometimes I feel I could takeover any abandoned building in New York and run an event there. Other times I feel pushed constrained by society to into a tiny space to make something on a computer, which leads to a huge problem.
 
 There is no free wifi in New York. Its age is showing. I don't think modern architecture can be blamed there. Also, there aren't any outlets. One has to rely on commodity.*
 --
 
 A lot of my negative thoughts of New York are based on my visit after traveling, which is kind of unfair. Even worse, I spent quite a bit of time on Manhattan because the school is there. It was quite a suffocating experience. When I used to live in Brooklyn, things seemed much peachier.
 --
 
 From <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/i-still-dont-understand">I Still Don't Understand</a>:
 <blockquote>To live in a society where one has to constantly, consciously and unconsciously, make decisions to avoid doing wrong, especially in simple daily actions such as buying food and discarding trash, to ignore indoctrination and propaganda, obvious or not, is the result of a failed society.
 
 All nations suffer from these things. No nation is pristine; Shit is prevalent.</blockquote>
 I feel there's far less of this kind of decision-making taking place in Taiwan. Less research, more doing. I find a local service person to do whatever I need to do, and it just works. My money goes to the street vendor, the healthcare shop, bike shop, or whatever. Convenient stores may be the only decision-making I remember (suck it 7-11!). There was no research of ratings or quality assurance of the places I went to. I just have faith in the people. I'm not sure if I've quite quite built that much faith in New York, especially for professional services. I only feel good in a good neighborhood, which is usually an ethnic enclave. 
 
 I felt quite good in San Francisco too. Though, I lived in a Chinatown there. Perhaps it's just the friendly nature of the people there, of which a great amount are Asian.
 
 <blockquote>
 Yet, because less developed societies are just that, the problems are less developed too. Government may be corrupted, but people at least know what they’re eating, drinking, where their trash is going, how their dwelling was made, who their children’s teachers are, have less equality problems, and can afford and/or have free emergency healthcare. Also, with less money, there’s less chance of government committing large-scale wrongdoing such as imperialistic wars.</blockquote>
 
 Taiwan throws out the trash themselves, know what they're eating and drinking (kind of, hah), take care of educators, have affordable healthcare.
 
 New York suffers greatly from this. It is an entirely artificial world. People throw trash anywhere, nothing is recycled (though it's negligible compared to larger matters), there's over-consumption and over-production, teachers are underpaid and under-appreciated, and the food comes from the top food manufacturers which themselves have awful ethics. Poor ethics exist from the top to bottom.
 
 From <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/creativity-as-organization-from-chaos" title="Creativity as Organization from Chaos">Creativity as Organization from Chaos</a>:
 <blockquote>If this is the case, then it is best to live on the edge of society. Cities are the most potent area of human organization. One needs distance, surround oneself with less common materials, then create. It will also lead to a more creatively efficient lifestyle, as the mind struggle to piece together the world into new designs and idea</blockquote>
 
 During the two times I spent in New York, I never left it. I didn't go into any kind of nature, save public parks, and that's frightening. I didn't see any farms, beaches, hills, mountains, forests, anything. A friend said he was able to camp just an hour away. So it was possible, but I didn't think of it. I was so far into nature, I just didn't think about exploring out of it on any weekend. Everything I experienced was artificial.
 
 Taiwan has nature, bounds of it, and I actually feel it, and can quickly hike a nearby hill, or even bike to the beach.
 
 In San Francisco, I also spent quite a bit of time biking around Golden Gate park, to the beach, and up and around some other places. Nature naturally attracts me, and if it's accessible, I spend time with it.
 
 Taiwan feels it goes further though. I can go to other cities, towns, or farms, beautiful natural places. This is because Taiwan has a fantastic train system that goes around the country at every hour, whereas the public transportation of America is limited to the metro system and infrequent buses with no stops on the coasts.The train has a huge enabling effect. I have a friend who works on in one city and commutes to another one-quarter across the island. It was very easy for me to move to another city and work. There's a feeling that one could work anywhere on the island, save the mountains in the middle, because of it, and people do. Many people in Taipei school or work for a short period, or even commute from other cities everyday. Low-cost trains have such a strong effect that I bet if America was linked by trains, the suburbs would have died much quicker, having people move into cities.*

 From <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/the-ideal-neighborhood" title="The Ideal Neighborhood">The Ideal Neighborhood</a>:
 
 <blockquote>Developing countries with problems may sway one toward human rights and politics. Living in two contrasting societies can make one feel that the other is absurd.</blockquote>
 
 Though not developing, Taiwan sometimes feels so. I don't feel much difference from Taiwan and Thailand. And I do feel much closer to people, as opposed to materials.
 
 <blockquote>Creativity in cities can lead to furthering of aesthetics. My history clearly shows that I think of aesthetic ideas while living in a city where I consume contemporary art. Though, that may be from reacting to it. I do often think about high art in less developed places too, but it’s greatly affected by the locality, perhaps using less technology and more local materials: local craftsmen, bamboo, food carts, natural landscapes.</blockquote>
 
 As a foreigner in Taiwan, even after living there for quite some time, I still haven't quite adapted to everything to the point I've forgotten the artificial. Also, going to the arts shop on Canal St. isn't quite the same as going to a random shop in Taipei to buy junk. I feel quite alright to cut a tree for wood, go to a mine for minerals, find metal at a scrapyard. I feel this is incredibly important for any creative profession. Materials is precisely what I feel lacks in the developed world, full of digital data. Though I'm sure people feel comfy in a workshop in Dumbo, I wasn't able to achieve such heights.
 
 And again, this closeness to nature may have been gained because of the simple access of trains.
 
 <blockquote>Creativity in developing countries, or any society other than one’s own, also provides another perspective, which will shape what one creates. It forces the creator to be more mindful of the audience, resulting in a more universally appreciated art, one that works in their past society and current society, fitting for structuralism. It could have elements of traditional cultures, different political systems, different amounts of wealth. I feel Ai Wei Wei exceeds because of this. He can use craftsmen in China to create a massive piece, understanding their place on a human and political scale.
 </blockquote>
 
 I think just living in two kinds of societies is enough: developed and developing. Africa might just be too mind-bending for me. Learn the aesthetics before going to the developing country.
 
 <blockquote>Creativity in developing countries can also lead to practical applications, useful technology. In a developed country, technology seems to have passed the needs of humans. Each individual could live with 50 things or less. Living with less would increase the chance of creating something useful. If it is useful to someone with less, it is likely be useful to the rest.
 
 Therefore, I believe creating in a developing country may be better for artists, humanists, innovators, hippies, and, perhaps, anyone of age. With the internet, it is easy to catch up current sciences and aesthetics. Being a part of a human rights community would surely lead to more practical technology. If one has time, one can continue creating high aesthetic art with a unique perspective, likely more political. Though, it may be difficult without a community, such as those that exist in cities.</blockquote>
 
 I don't think Taiwan suffers from much human rights problems to the level of developing countries. It seems they're gotten rid of most of the bad things. But it's quite possible for me to take a very cheap flight to Indonesia for empowerment, which could be conducive to practical innovation. Though, perhaps the same could be said for Central America.

 New York has great communities; Taiwan is a community. The recent bailout in America and protests and elections results of Taiwan proved that.
 
 It's possible to live in a community and ignore anything higher in structure, but I think, especially of people who have the knowledge and time to worry about things on grand scale -- international affairs, politics, imperialism, etc., it's human to care for it.
 
 If a failed government doesn't have the solidarity for successful activism, not just Ferguson, then the I think that the people of the country don't care much for their own country or of others.
 
 To even have morals (and not confused with patriotism and "defense") is new to me. Though I attended John Stewart's march and Occupy Wall St. I didn't have much hope in it. Contrarily, <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/a-foreigner-crashes-at-the-legislative-yuans-slumber-party" title="A Foreigner Crashes at the Legislative Yuan’s Slumber Party">The Sunflower Movement</a> was a profound experience.

 There's no better way of understanding a country than traveling around it, and any traveller will tell you that like Southeast Asia, Taiwanese people are polite, courteous, and extremely helpful.
 
 The effects of the ethics show in the way modern society was shaped: it's clean, convenient, people are not wasteful, people are willing to spend time to talk.
 
 Stay in a country with those ethics, and one starts to build a deep appreciation and affection for the people.
 
 Ethics override financial factors. Besides, it's the Information Age, professional work is now location-independent.
 
 When a country has ethics you appreciate, working, even the lowest service job, doesn't feel so bad. As a person who's had a decent salary before, I don't mind working as a street vendor, or even in a popular tea shop in Taiwan. The customers are nice. The shops are outdoors, so there's good public interaction and vision. It feels good. I don't think I would feel the same if I were to work at McDonalds.*
 
 Perhaps the main question is, <strong>are the ethics of a country more important than a select few amazing people?
 
 Yes. Yes it is.</strong>
 
 And with that, I now know, Taiwan will always be my destination. 3632 2014-12-04 06:12:21 2014-12-04 11:12:21 open closed new-york-and-taiwan publish 0 0 post 0 Ethics New York Social Philosophy Taiwan Urban Philosophy _edit_last 1 _wp_old_slug new-york-versus-taiwan _yoast_wpseo_primary_category Searching for the Greatest Environment Ethics http://rahilpatel.com/blog/searching-for-the-greatest-environment-ethics Thu, 04 Dec 2014 07:10:49 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=3651 <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/the-life-of-a-nomadic-schizoid" title="The Life of a Nomadic Schizoid">Nomadic lifestyle</a> brings the thought of non-directional, endless possibly circular, flow. Of my personal experience, this is not true. It's more of a search for the greatest environment. I <em>tried</em> San Francisco, New York, India, countries in Southeast Asia, and cities in East Asia. The process of searching is nomadic, but that process has an end. The nomad finds a community and becomes a settler. Of my search, I found three ideal communities: <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/new-york-and-taiwan" title="New York and Taiwan">New York, Taiwan</a>, and, paradoxically, the world.
 --
 
 The greatest environment is an ideal. Isn't that why people migrate? For a better life? For the materialist, the greatest environment provides the greatest life.
 
 Though there are many ways to live a good life, I'm quite certain it's a life that constantly evokes creativity; Any other life seems brain-dead.
 
 What evokes creativity? <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/creativity-external-stimuli-cities-and-suburbs" title="Creativity, External Stimuli, Cities, and Suburbs">External stimuli</a>. That includes people.
 
 Does artificial stimuli have more merit than natural stimuli? Dewey says yes, an aesthetic experience "ultimate judgment upon the quality of a civilization".
 
 Does the ability to experience fine art through the internet remove the factor of location? No, because what one experiences through a screen is not the same as a physical experience, and one would be unable to experience it the same, less likely leading to reaction.
 
 Is creativity just a reaction? Even when one uses a methodology, the mind combines past information to create new ideas.
 
 Does the quality of fine art that one is often exposed to make one's creations better?
 
 Does the lack of exposure to fine art make one more likely to create more divergent ideas?
 --
 
 Is MIT the best environment? It's probably the single community that caused the greatest positive changes in the world.
 
 Should MIT be emulated? MIT is just a physical space with a bunch of smart people, which means only the people matter, not the space. It's not even in a real city (okay, maybe I haven't been to Boston, but come on!).
 
 Does that mean space is not a factor? I can't believe that.
 
 Personally, I know no better way of understanding the world than walking on this earth. No media or settled lifestyle could have evoked the thoughts I had while traveling.
 
 Additionally, I know no better way of sparking creativity than walking on this earth. As one sits for a moment, the mind will put together the things in wonderful ways.
 
 Perhaps this is limited to artist personalities.
 
 There are two ways to explore, through the external world and through the minds of people.
 
 MIT offers people. The world (including cities) offer both.
 
 A single small community is exclusive (the reason for my apathy of college towns). The community must be inclusive. A community of communities, including public interaction -- <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/new-york-and-taiwan" title="New York and Taiwan">a city, or even a country.</a>
 --
 
 Though an inclusive best single environment, constant movement should also considered an option.
 
 Artists move from residency to residency, gaining a better understanding of the world each move.
 
 Are art objects enough to gain a better understanding outside one's own society? I don't think so. Even with the abundance of information and cameras, I still feel experience cannot be replace.
 
 Are art objects enough to evoke deep thoughts from the mind? Perhaps that takes some methodology, practice, and the right social environment.
 
 Can an institution, even of the greatest minds, replace the world? Again, no.
 
 The greatest environment [for an adult] is in flux.

 <blockquote>An active life, that is, one is constantly making decisions before taking action. One thinks to call a friend, cook something, go to a park, embark an adventure, not because they were told to, but because one decided themselves to do so.
 
 The narrow passive consumption of Japan is more akin to the suburbs. One consumes the media around them or computer (although the computer is a more interactive form of consumption). The only new stimuli is media (if they chose a new one) and the social experience with people of whom they already have a relationship with (if they even created new relationships outside the ones they were born into i.e. their family).
 
 I would stereotype the two countries’ societies as so: Taiwan is the social island nation where the people are always friendly and happy; Japan is the dsytopian future where media and machines replaced human interaction.
 </blockquote>
 
 In another view, I feel that they have opposite social conceptions of community. I feel that Taiwan is a community and that Japan is a bunch of nuclear families (or, in the case of cities, single households).
 
 In Taiwan, there are a few kinds of housing options: single without bathroom, single inclusive (suite), shared apartment, and entire apartment. The single rooms are often connected, and sometimes the people know each other, especially if it's near a school.
 
 I imagine it's similar for Japan.
 
 In American cities, people tend to live together in two to four bedroom apartments, or even a house.
 
 Though Taiwan and Japan have similar housing, it feels as if there's less time spent in a Taiwanese household. The people are out, day and night. Perhaps thanks to the street culture.
 
 In Japan, it feels more common to go home. There's even formalities of entering and exiting a home. A home feels like a really important part of their culture. They buy groceries (which are almost as expensive as a meal outside) and cook food for themselves or their household, which may contain a nuclear family (or mate). They eat at home. They have a library of media at home -- bookcases full of manga, DVDs, and games.
 
 Because more time is spent in the household, experience becomes limited to it. Experience is constricted to the social relationships in the home, media, and now, the internet.
 
 I've personally always been a kind of street kid. It seems that Japanese culture doesn't work for street kids. People go to a library (or cafe) to take a book home, not to read at the library. There's less communal areas, less public spaces, because there's a less need of them.
 
 In a country of nuclear families, media increases in power as a means of communication. Contrarily, public communication, solidarity required to take mass action, decreases in chance. It's the suburbs effect. Except in the case of Japan, it includes the cities.
 
 This thought was raised after spending a day with a nuclear family. The people only talked of food. The leisure time to think and talk about it is a privilege that no one can see. The time one could spend thinking of others (outside of the nuclear family) was thought about a few times, but never lead to action.
 
 I always face a tension when coming into relationship: how much time should be spent on relationships, and how much should be spent on others.
 
 I feel Japanese people spend more time on relationships, and emphasize the importance of them greatly through parenting, culture (especially rituals), and it permeates to work relationships. Being a part of society means having relationships. Being outside of society is viewed as extremely bad. In this view, bums should not be cared or helped for, because they chose to be outside of society.
 
 Though Taiwanese people spend a lot of time on relationships, it seems there's less emphasis. One could be a part of the society without many. Outsiders are welcome. All people are cared and helped for. One could be invited to eat a meal with another social group, even a nuclear family. The outsider isn't seen as such, it's another person, another part of the community.
 
 In this post I use Taiwan and Japan. In another view, Taiwan could represent a city and Japan the suburbs. In another, Taiwan represents traditional societies (Nepal, small towns) and Japan modern (most developed countries). <strong>I feel the vital, simple difference in society this: one is aggregate of communities, the other is a community of communities</strong>.

 <strong>Causes</strong>:
 My personal depressions usually involve a combination of these characteristics of the material world, which affect the mind and body:
 
 Mind:
 lack of social relationships
 lack of sensory input (sensory deprivation)
 
 Body:
 lack of heat
 lack of sunlight
 
 <strong>Effects</strong>:
 The immediate effects are:
 anxiety (usually results in finding replacements for the lack of the effects [this can be very strong during more manic times])
 lucid daydreaming (sensory illusion)
 
 The later effects are:
 depression
 loss of time and perception
 oversleeping
 
 <strong>Actions</strong>:
 I want to elaborate on the anxiety part by describing some of my past actions. It feels so basic that the desire to bring those things lost back to equilibrium seems of animalistic instinct. I've previously taken actions to relieve all of the negative effects. The actions can be separated to two kinds: immediate and long-term. Here I will discuss the immediate kinds. The long-term actions are listed under my solutions which come later.
 
 The cause of sensory deprivation is usually an environment that isolates sensory input: a dwelling. I usually resolve this by either finding sensory input inside the house i.e. consuming media. This seems unnatural.
 
 I usually resolve the social time simply by talking to someone nearby, or by attending a social event. If there is no one to talk to nearby, technology can be used to communicate, but I am <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/social-life-in-proximity" title="Social Life in Proximity">reluctant to use technology to communicate to people</a> outside of the isolated environment. I'm more likely to rely on the communication of artists through art objects. Though this approach too seems unnatural
 
 The cause of cold weather is a matter of the climate of where I live. I usually resolve this with exercise, warm clothing, warm showers, and natural electric lighting. Though this approach too seems unnatural.
 
 [todo: long term, where to put?: One time when I was in Taipei, I took the radical action of deciding to go to India, perhaps strongly influenced by this need; It was winter, though not too cold, I did not feel great. It has also affected my choice in San Francisco above New York, and Asia above America and Europe. Temperature is such a simple bodily effect that the response is a part of homeostasis, yet the the desire is factored in such large decision-making.]
 
 [todo: move paragraph?] <strong>Houses seem to have paradoxical social and heat influences: the house has a heater, attracting people to isolation, as opposed to pushing people outside of houses, to gather in <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/public-places" title="Public Places (and Public Spaces?)">public spaces</a></strong>.
 
 [todo: move paragraph?] The fact I've written so much about depression and not everything else in life is because solitude causes me to talk in the form of writing, likely while experiencing depression.
 
 <strong>It is unnatural to build an artificial environment when the ability to move to an environment that offers natural solutions is possible</strong>. We don't live in a time where travel is impossible or too expensive. I feel there is a very simple, yet strong cognitive bias here, to the point that <strong>the decision to live in the place one currently resides is now unthought of</strong>. Individuals, families, entire communities alike could move, and often do when a stimulus arises (natural disaster, no money).
 
 <strong>Personal psychology and sociology</strong>:
 from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solitude">Wikipedia:</a>
 <blockquote>...some psychological conditions (such as schizophrenia and schizoid personality disorder) are strongly linked to a tendency to seek solitude. In animal experiments, solitude has been shown to cause psychosis.</blockquote>
 
 The desire for solitude for a short period doesn't fit modern society very well. I've got a <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/my-education">long history</a> of sleeping in class and working mindlessly during these times. It's the direct cause of a lot of wasted time of my own past.
 
 To seek solitude, yet not stay in it for too long is a common struggle anyone (especially artists that want to get personal work done). I've argued that it is <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/the-ideal-neighborhood" title="The Ideal Neighborhood">best to live in a community of a developing country</a> and even better to <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/living-on-the-edge-of-society-ethics" title="Living on the Edge of Society Ethics">live on edge of that community</a> for higher creative needs.
 
 In addition, nearly every winter I face this problem solely due to the causation of negative effects on the body.
 
 <strong>Solution</strong>:
 To avoid solitude, I need to simply remember to avoid these places:
 cold and non-sunny climate
 dwellings isolated from large communities
 
 The warm climate deters cold and lack of sunlight.
 A dwelling near a large community (small towns, cities, institutions) deters isolation.
 
 <strong>Conclusion</strong>:
 Perhaps these are the reasons I have a tendency to prefer <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/nuclear-families-and-communities" title="Nuclear Families and Communities">large communities to small ones</a>. To the dismay of those individuals I've met in small communities and for the self-interest of my own health, it seems <strong>my ideal lifestyle is to live within a larger community, which allows me to go into phases of soft solitude</strong>.
 
 This ideal lifestyle constricts my <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/the-ideal-neighborhood" title="The Ideal Neighborhood">ideal habitat</a> to a large community. Thus, the environment I live in isn't just for the sake of increasing creativity, having proximity of the intelligent and their communities, or other high-culture needs, but also for the basic needs of health, determined by very simple sensory and social factors. 3721 2014-12-06 05:38:14 2014-12-06 10:38:14 open closed solitude-and-depression publish 0 0 post 0 Psychology Schizoid Personality Disorder Social Philosophy Urban Philosophy _edit_last 1 Epicureanism and Location http://rahilpatel.com/blog/epicureanism-and-location Mon, 08 Dec 2014 21:56:18 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=3754 [todo: just publishing old drafts]
 
 Often, people have the ethics to try to gain a knowledge whilst being happy. The methods one uses to gain knowledge depends on location. If one is restricted to the confines of a single house, then the knowledge must exist in the house. First people are used, then media is used. If there are no confines, then knowledge can be gained directly from experience.

 I've been reading books lately, so Calvino comes to mind.
 
 The power of poetry (or poetic prose) is in it's conciseness -- it is able to convey an idea with a few words.
 
 A power often associated with conciseness is the ability to redirect the user to another idea. To continually do this is a kind of flux. 3766 2014-12-13 15:19:31 2014-12-13 20:19:31 open closed chaos-and-organization publish 0 0 post 0 Ethics _edit_last 1 _wp_old_slug organization-and-chaos Survival and Self-expression http://rahilpatel.com/blog/survival-and-self-expression Mon, 15 Dec 2014 21:48:45 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=3777 [just finishing and publishing old drafts]
 
 Animals try to survive. Once survival is easy enough, they try to create.
 
 In some societies, survival is life (developing countries), in others, it is given (developed countries, at least agriculture).
 
 If one believes in materialism, and moves to the other, will that person adapt to the other values? Meaning, can people's values adjust from self-expression to survival and back?
 
 When a middle class person from a place with self-expression values goes to a place of survival values for a long period of time, it's quite possible for the person's mind to change. For example, when people go to the army. They experience severe depression and are sometimes unable to adjust back.
 
 When a young person from a place with survival values goes to a place with self-expression value, they seem to have a appreciation for both. I've encountered a lot of great kids throughout Asian cities with creativity. They create, but many use their creativity to do good toward society, as opposed to more capitalistic reasons.
 
 When an old person from a place with survival values goes to a place with self-expression value, say Asian immigrants, it's rare they show much self-expression. They simply provide security for family and life. If money is left, it goes to comfort. No further thought is put into it. I still have no idea what elderly successful Asian Americans do.
 
 continued on 9/9/15:
 ...Accumulate capital?
 
 When an old person goes from a place with self-expression values goes to a place with survival values, say exile, do they have the <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/flexibility">flexibility</a> to adapt to survive again? Well, I guess the change of habits to survive will happen quite soon as one needs water and food. But I believe I was thinking of developing countries, not dying. Will a complex businessman do simple craft work? With the factor of time lived practicing one lifestyle, what is the general equation for human minds to alter their ideology?
 
 When a young person goes from a place with self-expression values goes to a place with survival values, they similarly seem to develop an appreciation for both. They try to direct their past self-expression values for the good of society. The good travelers I met from developed countries seem to embody this.
 
 Perhaps the goal is to balance both; Creatively increase survival.

They can't emulate a teacher, a doctor, or a three-year old. For the most part, it only provides knowledge in the form of data.
 
 It seems to me that there is a cognitive bias in developed societies whereby doing some digital work for good is significant in value, whether it's donating to a high level organization, funding a kickstarter campaign, giving data for earthquakes, or offering their own computer for protein synthesis. All of these forms of charity are very low in value.
 
 I don't know how the capital from high level organizations reach low level ones, but it's probably through a lot of wasted effort.
 
 I can only think at a community-level, and I don't quite understand why others don't. I believe, this is perhaps linked to the <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/the-home-fallacy-or-nomadism-is-normal" title="The Home Fallacy or: Nomadism is Normal">home fallacy</a>.
 
 Perhaps another reason to throw everyone who lives in the suburbs of a developed country to a nearby homeless shelter, empowerment organization, or professional aid facility, or, to a developing country, and do some actual work.

 The limits of Digital work also may lead to the discontent of people in the knowledge society.

 <blockquote>Morocco</blockquote>
 This country is near the top of my list to go to because it retains such a strong <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/happiness-and-public-spaces" title="Happiness and Public Spaces">street culture, and therefore high happiness index</a>.
 
 <blockquote>Farm-life</blockquote>
 Agricultural society?
 
 <blockquote>Innaritu understands multiple cultures and lifestyles, the similarities and differences in ethics. He probably traveled much in his life.</blockquote>
 
 <blockquote>Why not celebrate together? A problem with houses.</blockquote>
 Never-mind, the maid actually took the kids to Mexico. Nice!
 
 <blockquote>Kid's don't learn from television.</blockquote>
 
 <blockquote>Tourist shot. It's plausible. More likely to get in a car crash though, but that wouldn't have blown up in American media.</blockquote>
 Framing.
 
 <blockquote>Japanese deaf volleyball player.</blockquote>
 So much to be learned from deaf people.
 
 <blockquote>This film is fucking amazing because of the constant switching between societies.</blockquote>
 
 <blockquote>Hah, chicken leg broken.</blockquote>
 Reminds me of the time I created the belief that one must be able to kill what they eat.
 
 <blockquote>They had fun catching chickens though.</blockquote>
 There's a nice sensual pleasure in Mexico, one they were probably deprived of.
 
 <blockquote>Oof, such ethical conundrum. The older female indegenous-appearing person stopped pressuring the wound.</blockquote>
 Or maybe it was done?
 
 <blockquote>The deaf is shunned from society. Yet wants to be a part of it; Societal norms disregards them.</blockquote>
 It's so rare that I encounter deaf people. Perhaps they are less willing to come out to the public, and stick to institutions and home.
 
 <blockquote>Societies are too distant to face emotions for(?), only real experience can give to feelings.</blockquote>
 Perhaps this thought came when a television showing media appeared. <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/experience-and-action" title="Experience and Action">Media just can't compare to reality in inciting action</a>.

 <blockquote>Only because an American died such value is given.</blockquote>
 They even sent a helicopter!
 
 <blockquote>All to go for a marriage.</blockquote>
 Traditional values make people do crazy things. Even now, I have a cousin who's wedding is in India. The cost is at least the cost of displacing 20+ Indian-Americans via a round-trip flight across the world.
 
 <blockquote>Hah, the marriage in Mexico reminds of those in Southeast Asia and India.</blockquote>
 They just seem odd.
 
 <blockquote>The scenes of the Mexican marriage and park in Japan are beautiful.</blockquote>
 
 <blockquote>Cops shoot without care for the villagers.</blockquote>
 I didn't quite understand why the cops were so angry. Do they care for Americans that much? Weren't they Moroccan?
 
 <blockquote>The edge of civilization is near, especially as the world becomes more connected with transportation. The effects of societies clashing is inevitable.</blockquote>
 It's surprising how close (in proximity) these events are. The Mexican border is perhaps 12 hours away by car, or an hour flight. One could experience a completely different society in a matter of hours. As budget airlines increase, people do. The effects of this, I am unsure. 3786 2014-12-15 03:56:21 2014-12-15 08:56:21 open closed babel publish 0 0 post 0 Film Reviews Films _edit_last 1 賈樟柯's (Jia Zhangke) "The Hometown" Trilogy http://rahilpatel.com/blog/jia-zhangkes-trilogy Sun, 21 Dec 2014 10:55:24 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=3797 I recently watched Jia Zhangke's trilogy on and off over the past few days. This includes 小武 (Pickpocketer), 站台 (Platform), and 任逍遙 (Unknown Pleasures). I couldn't stop myself.
 
 I don't know of many films that explore the transformation from traditional to modernity as these do. As a person who's travelled to a few places where modernity shows it's face in products, notably, northern Laos, I felt thankful for them helping me make sense of it.
 
 I didn't watch the films continuously. I'd watch half, stop, watch another half of anther film another day. It's all a mix in my mind.
 
 I currently am at an all-time low, so my philosophical inquiry is equally so.

 小武 (Xiao Wu)<a name="Pickpocketer"></a> 
 
 已經，只有一個片刻的看別的社會，我的頭腦開始做事。我得直看別的人。
 As I said, I've been brain dead lately. Watching what other people do, how their minds work, is infinitely interesting.
 
 他們等著公車。哇，已經感覺別的世界。
 At the initial bus stop scene I already feel I'm taken to another world. A world during my travels, away from the sedentary life of a knowledge society influenced by written and video-related media.
 
 那個公車提醒我印度，老撾，尼泊爾。
 The bus reminds me of India, Laos, and Nepal. A little dirty, poor, and the people inside aren't so intelligent.
 
 哇，這電影非常好，腳踏車的場面，扒手，不聰明人看你。
 At this point I already felt the film was amazing. Perhaps it's because there are so few narrative films that take place in this setting. I was also quite glad to see a film to make sense of undeveloped societies, such as those I saw in Laos.
 
 The people stare. It's true. It's quite uncomfortable in reality, but it's quite normal. It's similar to the way I may stare at films.
 
 聰明的人不知道什麼做。
 Smart people don't know what to do in this kind of society. There's no science, art, or technology. No hope. They either must create their own organization (grassroots) or leave.
 
 再，法事，結婚對人做瘋狂的事。
 Again, rituals such as marriages make people do irrational things.
 
 哇，真的鄉村。跟印度的鄉村一樣。
 It really felt like a rural, undeveloped society, similar to those farms I've seen in India. It's so rare to see a film take place in such a place, and furthermore, have characters that are from that place. Perhaps it's because it's difficult to have those people to act, or, it's difficult to have actors act such parts.
 
 他真的不知道什麼做。有空，沒有創造力。
 The main character really doesn't know what to do. He has free time, but just has no direction, motivation, creativity.
 
 他沒有老師。他不知道女人怎麼做。沒有生活。
 He doesn't have a teacher. He also doesn't know how to talk to girls. Too smart to communicate to normal people? He has no life, but do others?
 
 我琢磨主任跟這個演員一樣。
 The protagonist must be the director's image. Also, the town must be where the director grew up.
 
 稱讚結婚真奇怪。
 Praising the marriage of a rich person is really strange. Loyalty for a rich businessman? Why?
 
 --
 後半我沒寫。
 I watched the second half at another time and I didn't write much. It was late, and I just soaked it all in.
 
 只看，非常好的藝術。鄉下人的生活。
 
 最後的場面真可怕的。真的可以羞恥之心。
 Again, when less intelligent people stare at you, it can be quite frightening. In the last scene, shame is added. It's a strange phenomenon. If one acts in a way different from what a society expects, people are bewildered by the action. Save, perhaps, in cities, where people have gotten used to differences, and generally don't have time or care to stare.
 
 ---
 <a name="Platform">站台 (Platform)</a>
 
 導演是主角。
 The protagonist is definitely the director.
 
 他小時候看電影。給他生命，知識。
 When the director was young, he watched films. It inspired him, gave him knowledge.
 
 現代主義。人學藝術，看電影，穿時新的衣服，抽煙。消費者。也一個孩子。
 The effects of modernity and consumerism are apparent here: people study art, watch films, buy new fashionable clothing, smoke (well, people did that anyway out of addiction). There's also the one-child policy. All of this is introduced to a rather undeveloped society. It's a step toward modernity from the last film, in which these influences did not exist, or, at least, it was not a focus of the film.
 
 With modernity comes aesthetic; The desire for aesthetic leads to consumerism? -- fashion, films, smoking. Knowledge and hedonism seem associated.
 
 It is so rare to have a film that explores the first effects of modernity. With modernity comes knowledge and consumerism. It's quite difficult to separate them.
 
 如果有東西，當然要。
 If something exists, of course people will want it. The existence of new objects gives knowledge of their existence, and with knowledge of it, people will desire. If in the Western world, or somewhere in the world, fashionable people, smart people, people with technology exist, and one learns that those things they exist, it seems natural to desire those things.
 
 Without the knowledge of them, one lives unknowingly. Avoiding them is asceticism.
 
 <span id="attracted_to_organized_information">音樂機對主角真有意思。</span>
 The boom-box really interests the protagonist. He's never experienced it before. It's portable; It plays music; It's an amazing invention. Shortly after, a dance party becomes possible because of it's existence.
 
 哈哈，看主演好玩。真聰明。住在不太聰明的地方。
 Watching the protagonist act within a society of which he is much smarter is really interesting. He only reacts to new things, consuming them quickly. He does the least amount of work to survive. In one scene, he casually grabs hold of a truck for free transportation. He's in control of everything.
 
 Only new things, knowledge is his interest. Otherwise, a simple life is enough. There isn't much consumerism in him. Just a pair of bellbottoms, and perhaps in the next film, eating at a restaurant, of which it is his mother's first time.
 
 哇，表現了最低的階級。
 It's just amazing to see a film taking place in the lowest class of society. For me, there is quite a large difference between blue collar workers in America and those people in northern Laos. The people in Laos just have a lot less things. Their house would maybe have a less than 50 items in total. There's far less stuff, and in my mind, it makes a large difference in society, no matter the social class.
 
 除了學校就是煤礦。
 The only options in the people's minds are going to school or going to the coal mine. Nothing else to life. No other way to learn. No other way to live. Society has narrowed life down to two choices.
 
 In the first film, society urged the protagonist toward business. In the third film, the mother urged a character to join the army; That character felt he had no other choice, and just felt hopeless after he found out he was unable to join.
 
 第二半：
 真好提醒我遼國。
 It really reminds me of Laos. I guess I haven't seen a film with this kind of society after going to Laos. It's all I could really compare it to.
 
 沒有前人也知道學校比煤礦比較好。他的工作非常不好。怎麼可能聰明人許工作這麼不安全？
 At least people without money (at such a low level of society) value school over the coal mine. It's always astonishing people know dangerous coal mines exist, yet are unable to do much about it, except, make art about it. How can people continue living in wealth without at least giving coal miners helmets?
 
 嗎，爸爸不知道他的女孩子去哪裡。不可能停她。
 The father doesn't know where his daughter is. An effect of modernity? Kids go about doing what they want, a generation different, unable to understand, manage, or stop them. The next generation is smarter. What can they do? The whole Tokyo Story conundrum again.
 
 藝術家自己發現他們做什麼。在鄉下真漂亮。
 Artists discover themselves. It's quite beautiful to see this in such a rural society. That even artists exist there. Their aesthetics are ancient as the the media that reached them, yet they are the most intelligent people in their society. It gives some direction. It leads to traveling to consume more art. In turn it leads to more performances, incorporating the things they learned.
 
 哈哈，好酷，藝術人有藝術時間。他們得旅行。
 Haha, there's a scene where the artists go to a shady place to experience art. It reminds me of shady art venues in American cities. It's more lovely here because of the contrasting setting. The artists depicted in this film feel no different than the most creative artists in Brooklyn. It's quite unbelievable to see it.
 
 哇，女人跳舞對人應該看得奇怪。
 The modern dances must look strange to the audience. Showing any kind of art to the general public must be similar to showing fine art to the general public of America: people don't understand nor know how to react.
 
 This dance reminds of quite a few times during my travels when I didn't quite understand art in less developed societies. In Penang, Malaysia, I went to a restaurant, and there was a performance of a transsexual singing old pop songs. In Baroda, India, there's a school that runs old plays. All over Taiwan, there are plays, Chinese classical music, and even puppeteering, The aesthetics are ancient, non-progressive. Art departments still teach them. It was always quite an oddity to me, as a person who lived in New York and experienced current art. It's understandable for old societies, but for any society that has an internet connection, it's very a very strange experience.
 
 他的爸爸也去城市。
 His father works opened a business on the highway. He feels like an intermediary step of modernity between the protagonist and the mother. The father doesn't come home often, a characteristic of modernity. Three generations in one family.
 
 
 <a name="UnknownPleasures">任逍遙 (Unknown Pleasures)</a> 
 哈哈，真花哨的表現。
 Hah, something looks really gaudy. That's the word that comes to mind when seeing modernism in less developed societies. Especially seen in Modernist architecture -- those tacky large museums with no actual inside of them. Those large housing projects with no humanity. Those performances done without knowing why, just mimicking another society and failing to do so. It's a really odd sight.
 
 哇，真好。他知道怎麼現代影響人。
 I'm still just amazed at how well the director portrays the influences of modernity.
 
 本人不打定主意。
 ?
 
 按摩，歌劇。
 There was an opera singer singing Western songs. Perhaps the existing aesthetic of Chinese opera helped understand Eastern opera.
 
 哇。他的媽媽說參軍。
 One of the characters mother tells him to join the army. For money or for "honor"?
 
 他住在安居工程。
 One of the characters live in a housing project, or it seems.
 
 哇，真的奇怪。看電視的房間，差不多karaoke。
 There's a room where couples watch television. It's quite strange, but perhaps an early form of karaoke. I guess television is the new media of the time, more easily accessible than books, and therefore able to convey ideas to less capable people better, especially apparent in conveying aesthetics.
 
 I think I recall in one the films, perhaps the first, that the smart character read some Marx. So, books do exist. Even in this film, the smart character asks his friend for some high-art films, finding none he wanted, but still buying one.
 --
 
 第二半：
 現代主義：理智人只有看傳統人做什麼。不需要參加傳統的東西。
 More influences of modernity: the smarter characters just watch more traditional people live and work, no interest in joining their traditions. This occurs in several scenes. The main character mostly just rides his motorcycle watching the world go on.
 
 人真的笨，他們反應好慢。
 The less intelligent people react so strangely, yet accurately from my experience: slowly. Though in the film it's quite strange to see actions be repeated five or more times. This occurs when hitting the main character in the club, pushing the girl down when she found out, the girl biking in circles, and some more times of which I don't quite remember. It's like watching a rat being conditioned. If one is accustomed to people in a city, these people may even seem inhuman, lacking life.
 
 In Laos, I experienced the slowest people I've ever encountered. Everything runs on their own peaceful time. I quite enjoyed it, but there was definitely a lack of reaction whenever one desired something. It seems desire can be associated to intelligence.
 
 在傳統的地方可以活只有短的時間。因為沒有理智人。可是如果你是聰明你得會作理智的事。
 It seems rational, smarter people, can only live in such a traditional society for a short period of time. They find that they can't really engage in society, so they leave, to join other more intelligent people, and do whatever they do.
 
 I don't know what scene provoked this thought, but in one of the scenes from Platform, there was a guy who left the troupe to go home, but came back because there was nothing to do at home, alone.
 
 Though, I think an intelligent person can do a lot, just in a more political way. The characters from Platform were artists, so it's quite difficult to share ideas when there is a gap in the knowledge of aesthetics.
 
 在社會外面主角看社會。只有可以看創痛的東西。
 All of the modern-affected characters can do is look at traditional society.
 
 現代人為貴。
 Modern people are valued. The girl is valued because she acts modern -- she dresses with modern clothing, she sings and dances modern songs. Somehow, traditional society values that, without really understanding it. Why is modernity valued? Because it is simply different from traditional society?
 
 二十年的錢她要用了修復房子。
 After working for twenty years the mother decides to use some of the money to renovate the house. That's what a good mother in a traditional society does with money. All there is left to do is make a better house. Her notion of work is simply something that makes money, or 'honor' in the case of telling her son to go to the army. It doesn't seem to go much further than that.
 
 Many Indians have this idea in their minds. They survive, make money, but after everything, there is little charity, or putting money back into the world, instead, they just build a large house, of which no one benefits from, not even its inhabitants.
 
 高速公路開了門，意思是，可以互通情報。
 A highway opens. In another part of the film Beijing wins the Olympic bid. More hints of modernity. Highways, at the time, were the only link to more information.
 --
 
 Looking at synopsis on Wikipedia, it becomes much easier to see actions. Here were some observations, and pieces copied from it:
 
 Aimless people, because there is no hope in the society. No empowerment, art, or science.
 
 One event sets the characters into action: the explosion of a textile mill.
 
 Gift-giving is the largest use of money, even going into debt and taking a loan for. After buying a gift, the character has to sell DVDs for a few yuan each to make that money back.
 
 Zhangzhi philosophized that we should do what feels good. Again, hedonism and materialism are associated with modernity.
 
 Feeling of no future after getting denied by army. Joining the army was the only action to make his mother happy, and therefore him.
 
 Learned to rob a bank from American films? Too much Quentin Tarrentino? Sadly, could have ended in death penalty.
 
 "At first it was the bleak and lonely buildings that attracted me. When I saw the streets filled with lonely, directionless people, I became interested in them." When I travel, I normally pass by such places, uninterested. There are many failed cities the world, especially in India and China, where modernity shows its ugly side. It really does feel as if there is no hope, just people mimicking others. No creativity, poor urban planning. Cities with the value of survival when cities are supposed to represent self-expression.
 
 'Unknown Pleasures was filmed using digital video in only nineteen days, as a result of time and budgetary constraints.'...'Jia was able to begin shooting a mere three weeks after developing the idea for the film.'
 
 'This generation is often detached from reality, filtering their experiences through the internet, television, and other media.' It is quite an alienating experience when one grows up with media as a source of knowledge, but it's up to the person to be able to turn ideas from media into conversational language. Though, when people only have television, no people or books to talk with, these people are left detached.
 
 "the attitudes of these kids are almost completely derived by the electronic mass media that they consume and that consumes them."
 
 'In Unknown Pleasures, young people lack discipline. They don't have any goals for the future. They refuse all constraints. They run their own lives and act independently. But their spirit is not as free.'
 
 For Jia, the story of the Monkey King "reflects the fatalism of [Unknown Pleasures]" in that unlike the Monkey King, these characters "struggle desperately. They pull themselves out of difficult situations, but they always fall back into new problems because no one can escape the rules of the game. True freedom doesn’t exist in this world."
 
 'That year, reality was more theatrical than anything we could see at the movies. It even leaned toward surrealism. The entire population got worked up. This strange excitement gave me a worrisome feeling. The anger of society's inner layers was beginning to come out and show itself.'

 TODO READ MORE OF THAT ARTICLE.
 
 Good communities such as post-modern cities and traditional small towns have a pretty good balance of physical and digital data; They are in tune with the world, their neighborhoods, and their neighbors.
 
 It would be nice to have crucial civic data to fit the physical, especially for the sake of encouraging civic engagement, specifically, urban planning. If a person's building is going to be demolished, it should be known. People physically see several things during their everyday commutes. They care for it. They should have access to the civic data that goes to it. And it shouldn't be hidden in community meetings or the digital world.
 
 Even if a pizza shop is shutting down, the pizza shop owner might say to his fine customers, "we're shutting down because the rent was raised again"! Most people won't respond to that with action. Instead, that would shrug and say, "that's life, good luck". Similarly, the pizza owner probably wouldn't have a petition for keeping his business up. The people are the agency here. It's up to people to know that rent has gone up for the entire block at an absurd price because a big business is planning to build a headquarters nearby.
 
 Thus far developed societies poor efforts at a creating a more interactive life have only lead to giving people mobile phones. So, it seems, for now, that an application is all we can do to give that kind of data to the people during their everyday walks.
 
 Is that enough? Will people download an application and look at it?
 
 Physical interaction is always more powerful than digital. Having a physical sign will lead to more action than a digital one. Only those who have time to research deeply to make a decision will resort technology for data. Otherwise, for those short decisions, a more casual talk is better.
 
 Perhaps there just needs to be physical signs everywhere about everything going on in dense places. If a building is going to be demolished, sold, built, there should be a sign that says so, far ahead of the date. That should be the law. If it is the law, then when something abrupt happens, citizens will be able to argue that there was no such sign.
 
 That reminds me of finding apartments in Taiwan. Though there's a ton of websites, just finding a neighborhood one likes, then looking out for a particular red sign that says for rent, a physical bulletin board, and talking to local people turned out to be a <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/the-apex-of-mania-and-creativity-in-taipei" title="The Apex of Mania and Creativity in Taipei">quite effective compared to using apartment websites</a>, especially if one cares more about the location than the amenities. Also, it's just more physical, and therefore more fun, at the cost of efficiency.
 
 The sign could have a website on it to a digital place. Physical things should lead to digital things, rarely ever the other way around.
 
 At least for now, we can start with that mobile application for the sake of easily geolocating places. Until Google Glass is as prevalent as mobile phones, I'm unsure of what can be done.

 Design Ideas:
 There should be a kind of portable electronic ballet for public civic decisions. A fingerprint, a few buttons, and maybe a camera. Place it at any location, and enable the people to vote for decisions on anything. 3827 2014-12-24 05:23:24 2014-12-24 10:23:24 open closed decision-making-civics-and-technology publish 0 0 post 0 Civics Urban Philosophy _edit_last 1 Materials and Media http://rahilpatel.com/blog/materials-and-media Sun, 28 Dec 2014 00:49:13 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=3839 I almost have the conviction that although in the Information Age data and the organization of it is crucial, the materials used to interact and display are more so and more overlooked.
 
 Looking at design and technology programs, it seems most build on the Internet of things, micro-controllers in everything, but far less into the use of new materials. Of all the materials, natural and artificial, surely there must be an infinite amount of combinations.
 
 MIT Media Lab (especially Tangible Media) has a mix of innovations around this, but not quite there. For example, there is a material with the ability to switch between soft and hard. New materials like this could be the foundation of another infinite amount of ideas. Another example, there's something akin to a pin-screen that a user can digitally manipulate. The actual prototype is quite mechanical, steampunk. But that's what I think is needed, redirect some innovation to those material contraptions.
 
 We should think: What kind of material best conveys a certain kind of information. It would lead to screens being replaced by more intuitive materials. Perhaps there should be no screens at all.
 
 How was it that all the focus has gone so far into digital information and not the way we interact? What happened to "the medium is the message?". Did people passively accept written or digital language as the best method of gaining information?
 
 It really is the most efficient way to get information we want, though very awkward in style -- using a keyboard and mouse while looking at a screen, likely sitting down at a place near an electrical socket. People using computers to gain data is an example materialism in the Information Age. Digital materialism.
 
 How come for many people digital materialism is more likely than physical? It's more efficient in getting what's exactly wanted, yet there's far less data than a walk in the city or in nature.
 
 That leads to the idea that the Internet and the ability to interact with it should be available everywhere, in cities and nature. But even more so in nature.
 
 Living in nature yet having an unlimited resource seems like the ultimate way to live.
 
 ...welp that thought digressed.

 Sometimes this is good, as in innovations.
 
 Usually it isn't, as in any charitable organization higher than the community level.
 
 The cost in time of moving money, allocating other resources, and trying to innovate results in far less actual work.
 
 If one has the time, forget the ideas and do some actual work. Be part of the society in aid. One should always be able to think while working. 3843 2014-12-28 19:39:05 2014-12-29 00:39:05 open closed the-failures-of-self-expression-as-charity publish 0 0 post 0 Ethics Humanitarianism _edit_last 1 Epicureanism in the Suburbs http://rahilpatel.com/blog/epicureanism-in-the-suburbs Mon, 29 Dec 2014 01:09:25 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=3848 Gaining knowledge in the suburbs leads to more frequent use of and perhaps even a reliance of media as a source of knowledge.
 
 The suburbs relies on automobile transportation. Compared to the city where the city is accessible by public transportation, or a countryside, where one has a bicycle or scooter may be enough to get around, the suburbs blocks people from getting around easily and efficiently. 
 
 The commute lacks experience. Entering a car, getting outside of a neighborhood, going on a highway, and just to enter another neighborhood is dull.
 
 Therefore, to have an experience with people and the environment become less efficient.
 
 Media becomes a more effective option. Of course, at the cost of a real experience -- observing reality and being a part of society.
 
 Sole use of media is a less effective method of gaining knowledge than real experience.
 
 Therefore, houses are detrimental to the efficacy of gaining knowledge. 3848 2014-12-28 20:09:25 2014-12-29 01:09:25 open closed epicureanism-in-the-suburbs publish 0 0 post 0 Ethics Social Philosophy Urban Philosophy _edit_last 1 The Distance between Humans http://rahilpatel.com/blog/the-distance-between-humans Mon, 29 Dec 2014 01:41:24 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=3851 The distance between humans determines how much one cares for them, and therefore, how much time is spent with them.
 
 In the suburbs, people live in familial households. The inhabitants care for the family, even their materials, but not the public. Most time is allocating is allocated to family and materials.
 
 In dense cities people live alone, with roommates, or with a family. People care for roommates, family, and, the public.
 
 In my personal history, I have a natural tendency to live with the people I value the most, within the best community I know of at that specific time.
 
 People (who have the privilege) have a tendency to migrate toward people with similar values.
 
 When this idea is applied to cities, people choose neighborhoods who's inhabitants values are similar to theirs.
 
 Though I believe cities should be left to anarchy, this tendency ruins diversity. I almost prefer that people be placed at random. What kind of place would that be?
 --
 
 Eh, well this thought just came to me while my Dad was doing a meaningless task. I just kept thinking that because one lives in a house in the suburbs, one physically does not see others much, and one doesn't think of allocating time to others.
 --
 
 This thought also is connected to the idea of the <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/the-home-fallacy-or-nomadism-is-normal" title="The Home Fallacy or: Nomadism is Normal">home fallacy</a>. Furthermore, it is a problem with society and the upper class.
 
 <blockquote>Decision makers are able to insulate themselves with bottled water and gated communities.
 <cite>Jared Diamond, <em>Why do societies collapse?</em></cite></blockquote>
 
 I'm also personally reminded of India, where the upper class live in lavish farm houses, away from society, building their own world, a few kilometers away from slums. I'm reminded of how those people immigrate to America and live in gated communities, including my own family and many of the Indian community. It is no different from feudal societies.
 
 I am reminded of the upper classes of all societies: Nob Hill in San Francisco, West and East Sides of Manhattan, the farmhouses in India, the houses with gardens a bit north in Taipei (very mild form), the commercial mid-town-like districts of all cities.
 
 How can they be so insular? How can they only live in their own abode, drive a car, ignoring the world, while living in such bustling cities?
 
 It is a problem with the human mind. The mind can only make sense of and organize a limited amount of information, using simple ideas as aid. The mind adapts to the small world they have created. They cannot grasp much more. They can't handle the city, so they isolate themselves from it. Or, they are completely immoral.
 
 It is also a problem with society, especially for Indians, where such a feudal life may be standardized, and now through media, such as Bollywood. When all of the media they consume show slavery, it becomes institutionalized.
 
 Perhaps the culture of feudalism continues when they migrate to developed countries to own businesses: especially hospitality, which is wage labor at its most primitive form. Short-term rent for high profit.

 <blockquote>Equanimity, detachment, apathy, is the only way society works, where sane people observe without action.

 I feel that people who have less intelligence organize more. People need to organize things to make sense of it. When a person with money with less intelligence organizes, they create a house away from the chaos. And in doing so, distance themselves away from other humans. 3851 2014-12-28 20:41:24 2014-12-29 01:41:24 open closed the-distance-between-humans publish 0 0 post 0 Ethics Social Philosophy Urban Philosophy _edit_last 1 medium_post O:11:"Medium_Post":11:{s:16:"author_image_url";s:74:"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/200/200/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png";s:10:"author_url";s:28:"https://medium.com/@rahil627";s:11:"byline_name";N;s:12:"byline_email";N;s:10:"cross_link";s:2:"no";s:2:"id";s:11:"9d42fdc94ed";s:21:"follower_notification";s:3:"yes";s:7:"license";s:19:"all-rights-reserved";s:14:"publication_id";s:2:"-1";s:6:"status";s:6:"public";s:3:"url";s:68:"https://medium.com/@rahil627/the-distance-between-humans-9d42fdc94ed";} _yoast_wpseo_primary_category Tools for Organizing http://rahilpatel.com/blog/tools-for-organizing Tue, 30 Dec 2014 09:14:53 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=3866 If <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/chaos-and-organization" title="Chaos and Organization">minds are constantly organizing things</a>, then the creation of tools for people to organize is necessary to enable people to organize things.
 
 I've been listening to 8tracks recently, and am just amazed at the work that people do to organize songs into playlists. No machine (Pandora, etc.) can compete. <a href="http://8tracks.com/hardlyanywhere">This guy</a> created 52 playlists of amazing, esoteric (to me) songs. People take songs from free online sources, and put them into playlists.
 
 I often search by country to hear music around the world -- folk, mix, whatever. One can really get a sense of the country by just the music. If the country is more rational-secular such as northern European countries it's likely more media-influenced, where rock and electronic music prevail. If the country is more traditional and less developed tribal music will appear. Listen to African music for drums, dance, and those Mali hits. Listen to Morocco and one gets Arab and classical influences. Listen to Algiers and one gets Arab influences in French lanugage. Listen to Hong Kong for some old Cantopop. Listen to Taiwan for some old Mandopop. Listen to Antarctica, and one gets what someone feels what Antarctica sounds like.
 
 All of this was created because a tool was created that enabled people to organize.
 
 What organizing tools could be created to do good? I think I mentioned before about some earthquake reporting tool. Anything could be logged with a geolocation. But there needs to be an incentive. <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/creativity-as-organization-from-chaos" title="Creativity as Organization from Chaos">The process of organizing should feel creative</a>.
 
 Instead of playing some silly smartphone game, what if people were using that time to organize something toward something good, and felt good doing it?
 
 <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/experience-and-action" title="Experience and Action">In order for people to take action, one needs to have physical interaction with that thing</a>. <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/decision-making-civics-and-technology" title="Decision-making, Civics, and Technology">Civic engagement is a physical interaction</a>, and one way of doing good. But how does one constantly think of the world's poorest nations if one doesn't interact with them?
 
 Media?
 
 Chomsky doesn't even know the answer to this. He didn't watch the film based on his book Manufacturing Consent, but he knew the film didn't work because after watching it, people asked him "how can I help?", as opposed to taking action to do things, such as organize activist events.
 
 One film is not enough. It needs to be a daily interaction. A new poster of a starving child one passes by everyday. A relationship with a human.
 
 Back to tools. Before settling down to write a bunch of my ideas, I chose between a blog and a Wikipedia as my tool for organizing my ideas. Now that I'm a bit more idle, lost of passion, to pass time, I'll use it to organize more thoughts, without really taking an action toward something.
 
 The great thing about technology is that it can affect something somewhere else. The problem is that <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/the-limits-of-digital-work" title="The Limits of Digital Work">it's limited to data</a>. 
 
 The aim of an do-good organizing tool is to satisfy those with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Values_Survey">self-expression values</a> with creativity whose product then results satisfying those with survival values.
 
 If survival means, getting water, food, shelter, education, medicine, bug nets, and security, can doing something digital help? [todo: worth thinking of ideas for] It seems a better use of time simply communicating. Remote education. Remote consultation. Perhaps each person from a developed country should spend one hour per day talking to a person in a poor country.
 
 Back to tools again. Music is one. What about films? Does that make sense? If people were given a tool to take snippets of videos from free video sources, would people make video playlists? Could some be educational? [pretty good idea*]
 
 Earlier, I was thinking about why Wikipedia is limited to words. Could people organize it into <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mapping">maps</a>? Is there a standard for mapping? Concepts are much easier to digest through diagrams than words. [this is huge*, maybe]
 
 Some Wikipedia articles do have hierarchies of categorized knowledge, animated GIFs, graphs, and other diagrams. But can't a certain set of words be turned into maps programmatically?
 
 Can this Wikipedia article of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyriarchy">Kyriarchy</a> be converted to a map? It's just points, lines, and arrows. Can all <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatise">treatises</a> be mapped?
 
 I should come back to tools in the future, again and again. 3866 2014-12-30 04:14:53 2014-12-30 09:14:53 open closed tools-for-organizing publish 0 0 post 0 Communication Media Philosophy of Education _edit_last 1 Mapping Grammar http://rahilpatel.com/blog/mapping-grammar Thu, 01 Jan 2015 18:21:45 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=3881 Can grammar be mapped?
 
 Can grammar be mapped to automatons (i.e. state machines)?
 
 Can it be done programmatically?
 
 According to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_grammar">formal grammar Wikipedia article</a>, it should be possible to at least map it to automatons.
 
 [todo: find source for possibility of create mapping program]
 
 Then why are we still reading words? Shouldn't we be able to see state machines on Wikipedia?
 
 Instead of reading a 300 page book, in front of that book should be the ideas in the form of a state machine. When people read, I believe people consciencely or unconsciencely organize ideas into similar mental structures, often etching them on the sides of books.
 
 The Prince by Machiavelli has a pretty good struture (don't read it; it's ancient), similar to treatises. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Prince">Wikipedia article on it</a> consolidates it further, but it's still an eyesore. Each chapter or pair of chapters are cut down to a sentence to a few paragraphs.
 
 Let's take a sample paragraph form The Prince:
 "...if such a prince of ordinary ability, he will always maintain his state, unless some extraordinary and inordinate force deprive him of it; and although it may be taken away from him, he will regain it with the slightest mistake of the usurper."
 
 What does a paragraph from The Prince look like as a state machine?
 
 hereditary princedom (state 1) -- prince causes extraordinary force -> revolution and new prince (state 2) -- usurper causes slightest mistake -> go to state 1
 [todo: take picture of diagram on paper]
 
 Because Machiavelli's view is so simple, this idea turns out to be a simple sequence of cause and events; Causality. Causality can be easily mapped. This is much easier to consume, understand, and most importantly, actively think about, to argue against. All Wikipedia articles that are instances of causality should be mapped to a flow chart.
 
 More complex ideas will require more complex diagrams. But even those should be possible to map. 
 
 Some ideas are a set of rules. For example ethical treatises. Sets of rules are a program, and a game. One should be able to input data into these and get output.
 
 [todo: try more examples].
 
 The goal of philologists should be to create a program that can read all texts and translate them into readable diagrams (though, since the translating has been done, maybe those translations will parse better).
 
 Once a program is created, it can be used to create diagrams for each Wikipedia article.
 
 When the ideas become mapped, they then have a language that computers can understand, and can be used to combine them with other ideas. When all of the ideas of the world are combined, a meta-view of the world is created, and thus, the greatest view of the world, including the nature of humans in it.

 Unnecessary babbling. Do not read further.
 How this came about:
 These questions come from my loathing of books. I have <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/my-education" title="My Education">a personal history of progressive education</a> which does not involve books. Real experience, films, history, and biographies with Wikipedia by my side is my method of learning. So when it came to a point where I incarcerated myself in my parent's house, I tried reading a bunch of books, which started out as fun, but I could not handle reading someone else's ideas. It didn't provoke thought. I found it difficult to argue with words Without constant experience, consuming media loses value.
 
 [todo: It seems there are two kinds of media - history and idea.]
 
 The ideas behind books can be, and are, cut down to a small Wikipedia article. People spends years, write a book, and the only thing that matters is that small idea. It doesn't really matter how they got to that idea, and I don't particularly care. It's more of a matter of seeing if an idea matches with my worldview.
 
 To see if an idea, or even an entire worldview I quickly became attracted to the form of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatise">treatise</a>. Books that start with a preposition build upon that. Notable examples were Wittgenstein's Tractacus and Liebniz's Monadology (don't read those books; Only their structure matters). Nothing else quite made sense, especially those related to social sciences.
 
 When I read Chomsky's Understanding Power and The Life and Death of Great American Cities, I want to see state machines. Nodes and paths...

 To gain more knowledge, one could get a job that changes location and people. Or, change jobs frequently, i.e. contracts.
 
 When one creates media, one thinks about how to get the audience to gain an understanding of the world.
 
 I think in this way, Humans of New York is quite successful. People see via photo, and understand a bit of reality through text. Of course, the location is limited to New York, and even then, limited to a rich part of it.
 
 During more active times, I felt the only way I was gaining real information of the world was by searching videos of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIeTp7i1wqRZYiPoNXN2XHg">people</a> who would walk the streets of different parts of the world. Films are fictional. Documentaries are framed. Just taking video of the streets gives a real sense of what exists materially, and the human nature that reacts to it. To have an array of 8 monitors playing this, like <a href="http://staplecrops.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/veidt.jpg">Veidt</a> does, may be the most efficient method of consumption of media. Words surely being the worst.
 
 HONY is a good start. Perhaps it could have a 10 second 360 degree shot to gain an understanding of the area.
 
 Perhaps very soon, people will have small cameras recording everything all of the time. Then people could watch a random set of several lives simultaneously. Would a person be able to make sense of it? Act on it? The lives one watches would have to be near to act on it.

 Though transportation is most important, people still need to feel they can get around each town, even indigenous village, with some convenience.
 
 Hiking stops:
 For those less developed regions, I think it would be fun to build something between a hostel and a gazebo, so both native people and travelers can take rest. The exterior of the building should be similar to a gazebo, with an open view, but have an area that is blocked from weather to sleep in. The interior should contain minimal bedding (including mosquito net), clean water, a washing bin, a rice cooker, rice, and a first-aid kit. If the path is only accessible by hiking, than it should be at the distance of a half-day's hike. If the path is accessible by road
 
 Each building is a new architecture project, a new design, influenced by the environment, and the designer.

 Roads and towns are probably often created because a commodity existed there in some time in the past. Or the location was good for trading. Or perhaps just a bunch of people pushed somewhere and left to settle. Or in modern times, the city is planned for science.
 
 In the knowledge society, this matter less. But even knowledge societies depend on the commodities that become manufactured from other countries.
 
 Not sure where this was going...

 from a paper:
 Encouraging communal life by creating n accessible transportation and sleeping system.
 
 Is the current train and metro system enough? Are scooters enough? People can sleep at railway stations with little hassle. People can also sleep nearly anywhere outside, though mosquitos will come.
 
 Tainan's bus system is infrequent. Taipei's is great.
 
 Does it benefit to have access inland? That will develop naturally as more resource points are needed.
 
 What about building places to sleep? Are the hostels enough? Should they reach further toward nature? What can be benefitted from access to nature? Is there more science to be conducted closer to nature? More chaos? What is there in mountains, trees, rivers, and the countryside? Leisure?

Didn't take much notes, or thought.
 
 After going to a friend's house, slurring my mind out, we found a shared interest of times where human nature takes an esoteric path via passion. The next day I happened to watch Grizzly Man.
 
 Things written while watching Grizzly Man (quotes are Herzog's):
 "Natural tendency toward chaos, order in the Grizzly People foundation."
 
 jaded view of the public
 
 animal ethics
 
 excited that poop came out of a live bear, even grasping it
 - Mania, though philosophic.
 
 "Nature is not harmony, but chaos, hostility, and violence"
 
 Timothy only used little order: moving rocks to create a trail for the bear (or fish?). He left it up to nature. At one time, metaphysics.
 - He did not bring water or food for the bears. That's what zoo's do.
 
 Though out of sequence, Herzog's scenes of Timothy can be organized into one according to causation:
 birth -> teddy bear -> squirrel and other animals when young -> farm -> prime rib restaurant -> justice via animal ethics -> watch criminal court hearing -> kodiak island during summers -> kodiak island after summer, avoiding civilization -> death
 
 
 Thoughts while writing this blog post:
 I haven't seen a documentary in some time, and I found the narration adding a very interesting second layer. It felt like watching a film with a person who wrote a book on it.
 
 To use the words of ideas: nature, order, chaos, an human nature, is odd in a visual medium. Herzog makes sense of what's going on for us. If he had not narrated though, or asked the actors to be in it, the cuts of the footage may have been more comical, less solemn, yet, I believe, better, because the audience would have been able to make that judgement. Instead we hear the judgements of other's including Herzog's. Though, this may be because I very much dislike books, and enjoy the process of observing and thinking.
 
 
 A comparison to Subtropical Solitude:
 Another film I saw recently was <a href="http://www.vice.com/video/subtropical-solitude-123">Vice's Subtropical Solitude</a>. There a man abandon's civilization to live on an island.
 
 Masafumi lives to nature's accord, scheduling his routine around it. Missing one task could damage his survival.
 
 Like Timothy, Masafumi did not like civilization, perhaps also for the same reason: it damages the environment, including animals. Though, Masafumi seemed quite sociable to the documentarian. I believe Timothy is also quite sociable, in a manic manner, and only with the right people, as shown when teaching children.
 
 Masafumi lived with a bare minimal amount, his ribcage equally bare. Timothy seemed much more healthier, though, in his last footage, he said he lost 20 pounds over the summer. Timothy hibernates; Masafumi does not.
 
 Masafumi seems in harmony with nature, and disinterested in civilization. Timothy is also in harmony with nature, well, usually, but is is interested in society. This is his greatest difference between him and Timothy. Though Timothy despises society, he still acknowledges it. He wants to make a change. He created a foundation to do so. It is his passion. The creativity required to get close to the bears, and filming it all. Masafumi's ascetic nature appears stale compared to Timothy's passionate nature. Masafumi is merely surviving, living according to his ethics. Timothy acts according to his ethics too, but in addition he tries to shape reality according to it.

 After much travel, and when trying to write, I found it near impossible to write what I understood of the world because my linguistic ability was primitive. But <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/no-more-writing">I believe thought comes before language</a>.
 
 And when reading other's writings, I feel the same way. There is too much lost in communication.
 
 Historians go back in time discovering people who had first thought of a certain idea, in their language, in their words of the time, in their art. People understand a lot. It's just never written down clearly. The idea of linguistic determinism surely started before Wittgenstein, but there just happens to be a lot of research on him, and therefore his name appears first on the Wikipedia article. Perhaps someone thought it before Aristotle. Some mute person.

 Update: 9/3/2015
 
 There was a point in Taiwan where I was learning Chinese, which was at the level of a three year old. But I was also really active and determined, so I only used Chinese, not English. My spoken and written language were childish, and if someone else were to read or listen to it out of context they would miss out on anything somewhat deep in meaning, but when I wrote my thoughts down in Chinese and read it, I understood the meaning, because I wrote it.
 
 The same can be said for reading or listening to anyone who's ability to express their thoughts into language is comparatively lower than their knowledge -- most children, and perhaps, most adults.
 
 Besides, human language is so 20th century. Now we think in videos! 3932 2015-01-11 22:26:02 2015-01-12 03:26:02 open closed the-limits-of-my-language publish 0 0 post 0 Epistemology _edit_last 1 Lost Survival Values and a Proposal http://rahilpatel.com/blog/lost-survival-values-and-a-proposal Mon, 12 Jan 2015 03:44:32 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=3936 I've been having a recurring daydream in the suburbs of getting in a car crash. I should really get of this place...
 
 If people generally <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Values_Survey">tend to go from survival to self-expression values</a>, matching the notion of tending to self-organize toward more specific interests, then there is a loss of survival values.
 
 I the TV show Connections, our dependence on the history of science and technology is clearly shown.
 
 What I feel at loss are some of those primitive survival values. When a car crashes another, the people watch without knowledge of what to do, save, call for someone with specific knowledge.
 
 I propose everyone should be taught more than CPR in their health and physical education classes. They should be taught how to heal a wound, administer a shot, find clean water, cook grains, find a shelter, swim, make fire.
 
 Even in the developed world, I think these matter. One does not need to wait for an apocalypse. Cars crash. Planes crash. Bikers get car doored. Travel plans could blunder. Machines sever limbs. People become emotional and cause damage. People think of it less in the developed world, and in doing so, forget to emphasize the importance of learning these skills.
 
 When I am in a developing country, there is a feeling of safety that the mass amount of people around me will take care of me if something happens. When I am in a developed country, I fear they will stare or move on with their busy lives.
 
 Perhaps this is another personal step to a more communal life. Self-recovery is a characteristic of autonomous societies. 3936 2015-01-11 22:44:32 2015-01-12 03:44:32 open closed lost-survival-values-and-a-proposal publish 0 0 post 0 Social Philosophy _edit_last 1 _wp_old_slug lost-survival-values DIY Ethics in Developing Countries http://rahilpatel.com/blog/diy-ethics-in-developing-countries Tue, 13 Jan 2015 04:51:56 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=3957 From <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/new-york-and-taiwan" title="New York and Taiwan">New York and Taiwan</a>:
 
 <blockquote>Creativity in developing countries can also lead to practical applications, useful technology. In a developed country, technology seems to have passed the needs of humans. Each individual could live with 50 things or less. Living with less would increase the chance of creating something useful. If it is useful to someone with less, it is likely be useful to the rest.
 
 Therefore, I believe creating in a developing country may be better for artists, humanists, innovators, hippies, and, perhaps, anyone of age. With the internet, it is easy to catch up current sciences and aesthetics. Being a part of a human rights community would surely lead to more practical technology. If one has time, one can continue creating high aesthetic art with a unique perspective, likely more political. Though, it may be difficult without a community, such as those that exist in cities.</blockquote>
 
 I don't think Taiwan suffers from much human rights problems to the level of developing countries. It seems they're gotten rid of most of the bad things. But it's quite possible for me to take a very cheap flight to Indonesia for empowerment, which could be conducive to practical innovation. Though, perhaps the same could be said for Central America.

 From a paper:
 Can create in nature, using current knowledge and technology.
 
 Starting from nothing, bottom-up, help communities beginning at the lowest level, going toward higher rungs of society. One could ask for money from government for civil projects.
 
 The only requirements are cheap food -- rice and vegetables -- electricity, internet, and DIY tools to build new architecture, gadgets (design and technology), etc.
 
 Though in the beginning, in nature, this life may be perceived as ascetic, technology allows one to affect society, even generate wealth. 3957 2015-01-12 23:51:56 2015-01-13 04:51:56 open closed diy-ethics-in-developing-countries publish 0 0 post 0 Ethics _edit_last 1 Large and Small Communities http://rahilpatel.com/blog/large-and-small-communities Tue, 13 Jan 2015 05:14:43 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=3960 A thought from a paper:
 Shouldn't one be in the place where the largest decisions that affect the world are? The cities? Where post-politics exist?
 
 New York? You could build a protest against imperial wars on several countries, or just block wall st., and destroy the global market.
 
 Post-politics exist in small communities too -- artist colonies, shared dwellings, rural communities, small towns. Is that enough?
 
 It's enough for the community; It's self-sufficient. What about the rest of the world?
 
 Is a larger community better than a smaller one?
 
 It's more diverse, has more materials, has more population density.
 
 Diversity combines disciplines, leading to more creativity.
 
 Materials contribute to creativity, knowledge of material and through material. Need to learn to manage material consumption and personal creativity.
 
 More population density means more people. More people affect more people, in a utilitarian way. Need to learn to manage social relationships. Need to excite new projects? Only social projects excite me. More active, social, language learning, pleasure, happiness. More management of people. Urban planning and community involvement. From small neighborhood to the entire city.
 
 More people, more fun, more experience, more knowledge of people (human nature, history, culture, etc.), more creativity, more with similar knowledge to create specific communities, more knowledge of media, more knowledge of technology.
 
 More things means a more chaotic development. More likely to distract, and lead to art. Conversely, likely to work quickly toward more immanent problems, without over-planning, resulting small positive steps. Social art make people aware, and react socially. Politics?
 
 A large community can support people in more specific ways, allocating the work to others in a community, as opposed to relying on the limited few within.
 
 Should large communities exist? [todo]
 
 It seems a more ascetic lifestyle would lead to more rational, science, at the cost of detachment, leading to societal problems. 3960 2015-01-13 00:14:43 2015-01-13 05:14:43 open closed large-and-small-communities publish 0 0 post 0 Social Philosophy _edit_last 1 The Speed of Decision-making http://rahilpatel.com/blog/the-speed-of-decision-making Fri, 16 Jan 2015 22:11:21 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=3976 Rationality and irrationality are associated with slow decision-making and fast decision-making respectively.
 
 Slow decision-making is strategic, like a military officer in an office with a map of the world, all of the battles pinned on it.
 
 Fast decision-making is leads to the fastest action, and therefore is far more creative. Creative in the sense that more thoughts are created, and the ratio of them being acted is high. There is no "think before you speak", just do it.
 
 The balance of the two is the most important skill in life.
 
 For one can be indebted to a single job for eternity before a causal agent shifts the human. Or one could travel manically until one dies from making an error in decision on something that affects survival, such as eating the wrong plant.
 
 Too slow and it becomes possible to create apathetic suburbs in countries too large to have a sense of community.
 
 Too fast and it becomes possible to create cities to dense, too much stimuli, that one become addicted to the stimulus, and is unable to spend the time to partake on a large project, read a book, or listen to anyone else.
 
 Slow decision-making is needed for the rigors of science.
 
 Fast decision-making is needed for the charitable works toward humanity.
 
 Slow occurs in high-level academia.
 
 Fast occurs in ground-level organizations.
 
 Therefore,
 
 Slow is theoretical.
 
 Fast is practical.
 
 Are big ideas necessary?
 
 Knowledge has certainly progressed since savage times.
 
 Who's to blame, the brain or the hands?
 
 Doing one without the other is the problem.
 
 Revering one and not the other is another problem.
 
 Every organization needs brains and hands of equal status.

The brain pieces grammar together with words that contain ideas.
 
 Oral culture is therefore more creative, because one is talking more and reading less. People speak books.
 
 The life of a person in a society with oral culture is far more creative than the life of a person in a society affected by writing.
 
 The oral person has less dogmatic knowledge, more empirical knowledge.

 When a society has an oral culture, propaganda cannot exist.

 How do judicial systems work? Are juries the law? That's a problem, but it seems paper laws made more problems, or are ignored and not enforced altogether in the case of the US.

 Should education be conducted completely orally? Meaning, the teachers do not refer to texts.
 
 Every class would be unique.
 
 Without a foundation, would there be a problem with solidarity and nationalism?
 
 I don't think so.
 
 It should always be up to the person to create a unique path of experience, then be able to communicate one's experience to relate to another.

 Notes taken during viewing and my current thoughts while going over them:
 
 "The examined life is not worth living."
 
 great intro
 
 Cornell West:
 beam toward death
 
 philosophy is critical of these things:
 domination in institution
 democracy is elites that are accountable for most people
 of powers, which are not accountable to people
 - ?, notes are quite unreadable
 
 Current thoughts:
 I like the guy because he speaks a common language and lives in New York, but everything he said was obvious.
 
 Well, one interesting thing is "domination in the institution". I don't remember what he said, but the idea that all institutions are coercive, having a force. Chomsky and Assange say this too. Veblen finds the point where in the process of the development of society where force is first displayed: when the men of the amiable societies begin to war. That single force effects all of society. Forever! Well, until society learns to become amiable again. Naturally toward post-politics. Or some large-scale disaster.
 
 But that's hard when the rich are accustomed to be comfortably rich. And that the world has already been materially stratified, with slums to skyscrapers.
 
 Maybe the problem is comfort. Travelers travel the world as if it were the apocalypse. The world is equally comfortable. The comfortably rich need to be shaken. If Katrina hit mid-town and Silicon Valley, maybe people would have woke up.
 
 Avital Ronell:
 This lady read way too much philosophy.
 
 chaos
 "the other" - can never understand others, so should not violate with my sense of understanding, let it live.
 should always feel ethically, one does not do enough, never content
 
 current thoughts:
 The two points again is a kind of post-politics, autonomous society, where everyone is respected and appreciated.
 
 The second point is nice to hear, and confirm, as I am never content, and try to never compromise. Is contentment synonymous to comfortable? Interestingly, she appeared quite content in her walk around the park.
 
 Peter Singer:
 developed city
 - ethical issue of just living there. People should see moral problems.
 - money, consumption, saving poverty (with money) 
 - "obligation to help people in starvation"
 - can't justify eating meat
 - think of what to choose from another's position
 - neglecting not using money
 
 current thoughts:
 More obvious ideas.
 
 I absolutely agree with the ethical issue of just living in a developed country. It's probably why I watched so many foreign films when I was younger. Constant reminder is needed to keep life in check.
 
 His resolution is naiive and possibly detrimental.
 
 To think from another's position, people have to live in a less developed society. After a certain time, people won't choose to. Then they have to be forced to.
 
 Kwame Appiwe:
 think between evolve to globalization
 - we are good at face-to-face stuff, family, few people, can we figure out how to be responsible to everyone?
 - problem of globalizing cultures
 - recognizing other's moral values is having a moral nature
 - not just responsible for zoo people (don't quite remember what "zoo people" is)
 - cosmopolitanism - can't retreat to a few people and base moral on them, but also can't abandon them, either learn to do both (or not?)
 
 current thoughts:
 Again, the question of politics vs post-politics, but phrased interestingly. [todo: think more]
 
 The third point just boils down to appreciation, no forcing one's values to another. This runs into the second point, that when the world globalizes, cultures face each other, and this is where complex interactions occur. Like when a person in a bamboo hut is introduced to modern technology, and media. Things in New York seem fine though. People sort themselves out with ethnic enclaves, or mold in hipper areas.
 
 Cosmopolitanism is probably what every second generation child goes through with their parents, a la the film Tokyo Story, or just what every artist goes through when they move to a city. It fits my ethic of leaving traditional societies alone. But when the society to be left alone is wasteful, this poses another problem.
 
 Martha Nussbam
 foundation in Aristotle's theory of justice
 - job of good political arrangement
 - to provide each person with what they need to become capable to live a flourishing human life; Supporting human capability.
 
 social contract
 - think about people with disabilities
 - people get together out of love to create the world as good as it can be.
 
 current thoughts:
 Again, utopian post-politics. It's a nice reoccurring confirmation. I really disliked this lady. Stereotype professor, no novel ideas at all. Her basic ideas are found in the most ancient of books. Not based on experience at all.
 
 I agree, everyone should be provided the tools to do the best they are capable of. Someone said, perhaps Singer, that instead of thinking it as another person dying, think of it as lost talent, innovation.
 
 The helping disabilities bit fits well with the first point: to make all people as capable as possible.
 
 The third point is social construction based on utopia, which I agree with.
 
 Cornell West pt. II:
 Hah, I think I just like him because he's conversational.
 
 lover of wisdom
 not school
 courage
 to philosophize is to die
 truth as way of life
 
 reality
 listen to artists too
 - aesthetic pleasure
 *socially isolated yet more alive than the people on the streets
 
 current thoughts:
 I'm guessing the interviewer asked what a philosopher is.
 
 "to philosophize is to die" is a phrase that comes to my mind too. It's a social death. "socially isolated yet more alive than the people on the streets" was nice to hear while being filmed on the streets.
 
 'Listening to artists' is something I didn't realize 'til quite late in life. Probably because I didn't socially die 'til a late time in life. I was the artist. I kept an eye on the forms and aesthetic of others, but didn't see it as a way of something that people create as an action in life during a certain point in time and place.
 
 Michael Hardt:
 Democracy is rule of all by all
 - age 20s in the 1980's went to Latin America to see revolutions, politics, all he felt he could do was observe*
 - better to revolt in the U.S.
 - would U.S. lose or gain?
 - Go to ??? and start an armed cell. Practically did not know how. Guns, etc.? Don't know how to conduct a revolution.
 
 current thoughts:
 More post-politics.
 
 The first point sounds like me in Taiwan.
 
 The second point is really good. It's better to revolt in the U.S. because it affects the rest of the world so much. [todo: lose or gain?]
 
 After coming back from travel to the U.S., I had to make sense of the world. The idea of having such a guerilla-style revolution doesn't seem right in a developed country because it contradicts it so much. Whereas if one were closer to nature, on a farm, it feels more possible. It's a problem of adaptation. It's like creating a very weird art that no one understands. The problem isn't the idea, it's that it deviates so far from current societal norms, and that makes it more difficult to make reality of.
 
 Zizek:
 My favorite. He's also quite popular, not complex, but at least his ideas are based on cognitive biases ("wired to act", which leads to poor decision-making, especially in developed societies. It also feels that he's got some experience traveling. Thus far, it seems all of the others are Americans that haven't been outside of it. Zizek has the philosopher-traveler feel. A bearded friend on an old couch constantly disgusted at the world, and directly interacts with the world. Perhaps the least academic found in this film.
 
 Problem with world. We don't see everything, i.e. trash, (or people dying).
 
 temptation for meaning
 - natural to interpret to make something simple; but really it just happens
 
 the existing world is the best possible world
 
 against science?
 
 alienated from natural environment
 
 Know, but not act upon it. Should visit sites of catastrophe.* It's unimaginable we are not wired to act on it. Should learn to love the artificial, love trash, oil, animals, etc.
 
 current thought:
 The first thought is the core of all social problems. Related to <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/the-distance-between-humans" title="The Distance between Humans">the distance between humans</a>, it is a basic cognitive bias. Humans will take bad actions, even if they have the knowledge of it [todo: link zizek review, known knowns etc.]. [todo: requires a lot more thought]
 
 Finally a little cognitive science. Indeed the brain tries to abstract detail into digestible ideas. [todo: think more]
 
 This is the first time I've heard the third idea. This is very interesting to think about at any point of time, in history, present, and future. That humans overall try to create the best societies and altogether, the best world, and this is what has come so far. [todo: think more]
 
 He's against science? Did Zizek fail to notice the history of science (and technology) and how it affects the world? Or does he blame the hierarchy required to upkeep it?
 
 I agree with being alienated from the natural environment. The suburbs is the opposite of nature, and this idea is the only reason I can think of people are able to live between house, office, and Walmart.
 
 I agree with the catastrophe bit. People need to directly experience things to orient their mind correctly.
 
 People should love trash, oil, animals, and the natural resources which are naturally dirty. Perhaps it is the adaptation of comfort when people being to fear "getting dirty"
 
 Judith Butler:
 Don't think about ???
 - SF is accessible, public transportation, curve cuts, buildings -> social acceptability*
 - social repression of people: aversion to others, limited housing, carer(?), socially isolated*
 - did not feel she could get coffee
 - help is something we all need, though we look down upon it*
 - what can a body do?
 - where is the backlog(?) of human?
 - human as site of interdependency
 - want to organize the world based on all those things
 
 current thoughts:
 I really like that they are walking and rolling (I'm scientific) around San Francisco. Always good to think about urban planning for all people. This lead to my own ideas of <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/urban-planning-for-solidarity" title="Urban Planning for Solidarity">how the material world can socially isolate or bring people together</a>.
 
 Far better than whoever that last lady was. Social repression is a huge problem often neglected. Not in the simple feminism, black people stuff, but the more seemingly slighter forms of neglect: being averse to others. To think that all of the blind and deaf people are in deaf and blind schools and probably rarely go far from it because they are socially isolated. I wish they pervaded society. San Francisco probably is the place where I encountered the largest range of people: several forms of disabilities, disabled veterans, bums in the tenderloin, along with the hippies, yuppies, and in-betweens. It's indeed quite a refreshing place to be. New York can sometimes be ruthless in comparison.
 
 "help is something we all need, though we look down upon it". This is so true, and a core characteristic of community.
 
 Lastly, again, confirming the social construction based on one's utopia.
 
 Cornell West pt. III:
 Hi again! :)
 
 Romanticism
 - is harmony possible? Beethoven learned to look at darkness and still have it.
 - Blues starts with not caring for harmony, ride on dissonance.
 - Time is lost on romanticism, keep fairing(?), play, the experience, never reach meaning, die without meaning
 
 current thoughts:
 Philosophers' aesthetic taste is as old as they are. None of them have seemed to experience modern forms of art.
 
 I like the third idea. To just keep playing, progressively learning, in constant search for meaning, dying without ever finding it. This constant love for wisdom but inability to be content.
 
 
 Overall:
 I think the film did well in it taking place in developed societies, to show the contrast of the philosopher's ideal society and the world they live in.
 
 I think all of the philosophers fail in bringing any complex (in art, science, or logic) or novel ideas up, including solutions, which is also where the film excels -- I wish 10 minutes were give to every smart person so that one could easily gauge other's creativity.
 
 The film also works because all of their ideas point toward the same similar idea: post-politics (autonomy, etc.). The problem is that not a single one gave a solution. They didn't say, displace the entire middle class of developed societies, trade office employees with people from developing countries, remove superfluous jobs in developed countries, assassinate business magnates and distribute the wealth, stop buying products, sit on the streets, disrupt society. And that's probably what differentiates academic philosophers and artists or revolutionaries. They don't even say, innovate, use science and technology to consume less and spread more knowledge. None used any kind of empirical science to deduce their ideas, though, I guess that's what continental philosophy is. Philosophy is a temporary phase. They've all spent too much time in philosophy world. They're out of touch. They don't see the empirical data. Only Zizek seems to have empirically gathered enough data in his mind to create ideologies of human nature. Perhaps pop academic philosophers have a place, like Jon Stewart has his, but it shouldn't be honored. Academic philosophers are oxymorons. They say that the ideal is a community, but they aren't a part of it. They are neither scientists nor artists. These people are unimportant. Likable, but unimportant, in that, they have nothing novel to say, and more importantly, do. 3989 2015-01-19 07:29:42 2015-01-19 12:29:42 open closed examined-life publish 0 0 post 0 Film Reviews Philosophy _edit_last 1 All Products Should Have a Face http://rahilpatel.com/blog/all-products-should-have-a-face Tue, 20 Jan 2015 22:39:48 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=4046 [Product Ethics?]
 
 In my parent's large suburban home, there are a multitude of things. Those that I cherish most are either of most utility, <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/everything-i-own" title="Everything I Own">likely in my backpack</a> (some of which are from small companies whom I am able to contact), or an art object by someone I at least know by name or stage name.
 
 But of the products in the house, this creates a very disproportionate amount of people I am aware of.
 
 Who put this brick in this house here? Who put the pulled the wires through it? Who made this bed frame? Though, I sleep on the floor. Who stitched this underwear?
 
 If every product had a face on it, I imagine I would have valued the products differently.
 
 If this paper I write on had the face of a hispanic lumberjack or a picture of all of the people that work at the company. If this phone had the face of a Japanese factory worker lady. If this sleeping bag had the picture of the duck with all its feathers.
 
 Surely these thoughts become unconscious or never conscious or eventually lost in order to live life in the developed world.
 
 In the developed world, people often buy things from the person who created it via crafting, farming, or just putting tea in a cup. The gratitude is wholehearted and leaves a positive feeling to both.
 
 The hope is that perhaps when one sits in their home and cut their favorite fruit, with their favorite knife, that they don't love just the knife, but are able to be thankful to those Latin Americans factory workers that materialized it with a little picture. The house would be full of little pictures. Perhaps it would add a bit more connection in such an isolated environment, or more disgust. Both are positive outcomes.
 
 Until the developed world adopts this standard, it is up to people to create tiny photos of the creators, and post it on every object that they own.

 I was thinking about Taiwan again, but this applies to any society that doesn't have military strength to compete with the strongest powers.
 
 It was mentioned that the US can't even handle their own backyard, Latin (and South?) America. The revolutions of the early 2010s (Arab Spring and it's tremors) cemented this idea. People are more knowledgeable and less obedient.
 
 But militarily, what now?
 
 Build nukes? If a country already has the ability to build a nuclear weapon, it would take a lot of dignity not to build one. Even Pakistan built some, for the sense of security. This is probably the best first step for military budget.
 
 Build defense? I imagine it costs less than offense. The geographic advantage of being an island seems to still make a huge difference despite technological advances. The worst position simply being next to a superpower, connected by land, is really unfortunate. This is the second step.
 
 Build offense? No way to compete. Besides, that's what coercive, stupid states do.
 
 Amiable societies don't put money into war. If there is a rise in knowledge, disobedience against states, fundamental human values, dignity, a heart, then perhaps now may be a time where doing something humane would be seen as meaningful. Perhaps from this time onward, people will notice the good deeds and remember them, because now information pervades so easily.
 
 Amiable societies often are closer to having more survival values. They're nurturing. While still developing science (and technology), there should be more push toward nurturing other nations, and aiding them in times of natural emergencies.
 
 The effects of nurture is opposite of that of imperialism. It is a positive force that increases solidarity, as opposed to a negative force that increases isolation. Maybe it results in more raw material or manufactured goods for the developed country, but never out of coercion.
 
 Helping a less developed nation could add security for the lesser. If an East Asian country were to aid all of Southeast Asia, there is no military benefit for East Asia, but Southeast Asia may feel a bit secure against other larger powers. A solidarity among lesser nations is created from benevolence.
 
 Plundering a less developed nation should decrease relations with everyone, but it often hasn't, is ignored, resulting in no effect, because solidarity among higher nations is created from fear. There is no benevolence.
 
 Helping a more or equally developed nation could make a change. If Taiwan were to help Japan or South Korea during a time of disaster, there's an increase in relations, resulting in security for both or more for one.
 
 If there is an increase in human values, perhaps people will look at a history closer to reality, and there will be a bit more acknowledgement of truth. In this way, the relationships of nations will take on a few more characteristics of more mature, modern relationships, as opposed to childish, ancient ones.
 
 Then when it comes time when an an imperialist nation decides to conquer a neighbor, there will be more disobedience. In the victim, the victim's friends, and imperialist nation itself.
 
 If East Timor had good relations with other less developed nations in 2020, could the genocide have occurred so swiftly?

 Though tools for organizing makes sense for the mind to organize information, there seems to be the problem when humans organize too much, or, become habituated with organization and forget why they're organizing the things they currently are organizing.
 
 Therefore, there should also be tools for disorganizing, inciting a bit of chaos in people's routine.
 
 Luckily, most people have other humans or even animals around them to create new experiences. But many don't. In a quiet suburban house or office with ancient societal values, they may not exist, and people will get stuck in routine, letting time slip without thought.
 
 People need constant events to shake them, remind them of reality. For me this was <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/inspired-by-films-and-everything-else" title="Inspired by Films (and everything else)">films</a>, but even that was not enough during a period I was at home at a later age. I nearly stopped thinking, reading, experiencing.
 
 I still feel this is a problem of urban planning leading to isolation, and therefore less experiences. If one does not commute via public transportation, they experience far less, requiring more people in their dwelling for them to interact with and have more experiences.
 
 Those that have been isolated need to be reeled back to the city.
 
 What needs to be done: show reality, educate people that their work is not important as they think to break the social contract, detach people from their material belongings, educate people that a more communal society is better.
 
 How it can be done: media that shows reality (link to problem with media not leading to action), physically go to people and tell people this (civil disruption), in gatherings and individually.

 In the past I've professed many characteristics of Taiwan that I enjoy, and even would want in an ideal society: <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/taiwan-first-impressions"> Taiwan: First Impressions</a>, <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/taiwan-and-japan-active-and-passive-lifestyles">Taiwan and Japan: Active and Passive lifestyles</a>, <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/autonomy-of-taiwan">Autonomy of Taiwan</a>.
 
 Poke some questions at a Taiwanese person and one will quickly come to the conclusion that Taiwan lacks ideology. Ask them their identity, what they've done, are doing, and want to do, what they like and don't, the common response is "I don't know". But watch for a moment and their ideology comes to view, like cute ants they create incredibly cute mounds for everyone to live in, high quality tools for everyone to use, and still have a soft spot for their traditions: old and new.
 
 <h2>Positive Facade</h2>
 Everything is done with a seemingly positive attitude, so it's quite difficult to see the <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/a-foreigner-crashes-at-the-legislative-yuans-slumber-party">struggle</a>. During the protests, their struggle expressed itself in the least forceful ways: sunflowers, posters, decorative arts, and sit-ins. Again, ask them how they feel about the protest and the common answer is "The government is bad. I don't know what to do. Taiwan is always struggling." with a cute angry face.
 
 Another example of this positive facade: it is common to see people happily working, yet once one reads their Facebook posts, their journals, their LINE messages, struggle appears in the form of sad emoticons from LINE, FB cat emoticons, and short writings.
 
 Why the positive facade? Why not simply directly express negative feelings? Was negative expression punished and rid of during education? Frowned upon (should <em>endure</em>)? Is this simply a cultural difference in negative expression?
 
 When a positive facade is created in society, perhaps it becomes more difficult to express negatively, simply because it is against the norm. The resulting conflict being a positive facade opposing another positive facade.
 
 This seems to be the case in employee-employer relationships. Both work seemingly happy, but force exists, and in covert messages unhappiness exists.
 
 The unhappiness doesn't seem to stem from working, but rather, working for another person. Whenever one encounters an individual worker, say a street food cart worker, or a small school teacher, they seem to have to no qualms. It is a happier choice to have one's own business in a less developed area than to work for another in a more developed one. (And I agree!)
 
 [Even the slightest force is avoided. An aversion to force.]
 
 <h2>Cute and Happy World</h2>
 The cute and happy aesthetic even manifests itself in material: cute advertisements, products, applications, fashion, shoe-gazing music. Perhaps the same can be said for Japan. It creates an incredibly safe environment for all ages. One may feel quite difficult to find anything remotely socially bad in even Taiwan's largest city.
 
 The happiness of the people and material makes seeing the problems in society, consciously thinking about them, ever more difficult. This may be my largest criticism against Taiwanese society. So although there is plentiful cuteness in food stands, pet stores, foreigners, and any new product, worthy of several photos to the social norm, few seem to see the butcher of animals, the tiny cages pets live in, whatever awful things foreigners often do, and the factories in which the products are made.
 
 <h2>The Cute Impulse</h2>
 The response to cute aesthetic is a savage impulse. Like reacting happily to eating of tasty food or watching a cat video, it requires no rational. It is a an impulse, a feeling. And in this way, Taiwanese society seems to often react impulsively.
 
 Technology has exasperated this problem. LINE is Facebook, Instagram, Vine, voice-messaging, maybe even Skype, all-in-one. Feelings are expressed in emoticons. Messages are shorter than twitter messages. The sublime is captured by phone cameras. Action is taken without waiting.
 
 <h2>If it Works, Integrate it</h2>
 [Action without thought. Buying things at 7-11, McDonalds, without thought of consequence. Whatever works, the society will integrate it. Hostels work? Build hostels. Tea, snack shops, cafes work? Build them! Too many in Taipei? Develop the rest of Taiwan!]

 The people in a space contribute to the social decisions of a group. Social groups: neighborhood friends, family, classes, organizations, companies, hostels, towns, cities; outcome depends on the people in it.
 
 Win found like-minded people on the internet because the Internet contains the a great portion of the world. Win physically gathered people in a city, just as he did in the Internet, with a space. A space is the equivalent of an Internet message board. It's a place where communication is made for a group of people.
 
 Many personalities need a social group to progress in a certain direction. Without it, they continue in a viscous cycle, creating ideas, but not actualizing them.
 
 Space and people create experience. The awareness of the space and the awareness of people's actions (communication) is the experience.
 
 The change of space and people creates new experiences.
 
 Experiences are what give people knowledge and social relations (feelings, memories).
 
 Therefore a good method of learning is a constant change in space and people.
 
 The intensity of an experience does not have any factors, it is quite random.
 
 To create something (not consume, or copy) requires time to think (or talk). To think, time is needed in a space, perhaps without much action. A relaxed social space; downtime.
 
 People create naturally. Forcing people in a space and guiding them to create is artifical. These guidances work (school, art, jams, events), and are often needed for many personalities to work, mimicing a deadline, a restriction in social time, but it is not required; work has no time limit.
 
 All that is needed are people and time in the same space. This is how any lengthy work is accomplished. Though, work is not judged by its scale. This is also how several works by a person, or a social group is accomplished. This is a virtuous cycle.
 
 To gather people in to the same space is the first step of creating an experience. To do this several times is the formation of a community. 4102 2015-07-11 14:01:53 2015-07-11 18:01:53 open closed space-time-and-people publish 0 0 post 0 Anthropology Design Human Geography Social Philosophy Urban Philosophy _edit_last 1 _wp_old_slug space-people-and-time Habit and Addiction http://rahilpatel.com/blog/habit-and-addiction Sun, 26 Jul 2015 18:33:56 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=4108 A short thought.

 Addiction is a habit. People tend to create habits. Habits are created from living in the same area. The same area contains the same materials and humans. Moving to a new area alleviates the mind from old habits, uses a little mind power to create new habits 4108 2015-07-26 14:33:56 2015-07-26 18:33:56 open closed habit-and-addiction publish 0 0 post 0 Human Geography Humanities Mind and Matter Philosophy Psychology Social Philosophy Thoughts Urban Philosophy _edit_last 1 Awareness and Consciousness http://rahilpatel.com/blog/awareness-and-consciousness Sun, 26 Jul 2015 18:41:00 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=4110 Here lies the problem of living a stable life, why I prefer living in flux (constant change of awareness), nomadic ally.

 After reading chapter one of Parallax View:
 
 It reminds me of a previous thought, the impossibility of being (acting) another person. "Being in another's shoes".
 
 It also reminds me of the time a very emotional and aware period of wanting to know and understand the actions of others (Humans of Taiwan). As I travel I constantly think about why people act the way they do. I am perplexed. I wonder what they think, so I ask them. Unfortunately, mundane answers came out. As a result, I failed to bring about the awareness as Sans Soleil or a Tsai-Ming Liang film have.
 
 A lot of lives' actions indeed do seem to be affected by simple human decision-making problems: consciousness and habit.
 
 In politics, this impossibility takes form in the impossibility to organize others. Self-organization (individual, community [including direct democracy], as long as the self is part of it) versus someone else organizing (creating a structure; designing) for you.
 
 This impossibility is indeed worth thinking about...
 
 
 &nbsp;
 
 &nbsp;
 [todo: integrate old post, Changing Societies, first reading of Parallax View]
 
 A few notes scribbled from the first chapter of Parallax View by Slovoj Zizek:
 &lt;blockquote&gt;The problem is not how to jump from the individual to social level; how should the external-impersonal socio-symbolic order of institutionalized practices and beliefs be structured if the subject is to retain his 'society'
 ...
 proverbial egotist view
 ...
 thought and being (doing?)
 ...
 returning home may warm our heads but the fact remains, that this is all ultimately irrelevant.
 ...
 "Cartesian homelessness"...homeless / finding home...sailor drift to sea then found a home
 ...
 void: partial, individual, private
 social: singularity, community, public
 truth: universal
 &lt;/blockquote&gt;
 
 A relevant story:
 A small-time traveler I met once said that, as much as he travels, he can never be in the same position as the people he sees in developing countries when he travels. Then he told me about a story of how he had sex with a Filipino in the Philippines, in which the condom broke, and when he went to the doctor to get medicine to prevent the onset of STDs, he was told that what was left was reserved for certain professionals, such as other doctors. It was at this moment he had a taste of what it was like to be in a less fortunate's position. How it feels to be denied of available medicine.
 
 My decision-making drastically changes as I go in and out of societies. Out of society, I enter my philosophic mode, void of life. In society, I am affected by the people in it, and the culture, usually related to economy.
 
 But what's most important is that I am aware of these beliefs and practices and what people do, and see their habits. 4110 2015-07-26 14:41:00 2015-07-26 18:41:00 open closed awareness-and-consciousness publish 0 0 post 0 Mind and Matter Philosophy _edit_last 1 A Thought about Quality http://rahilpatel.com/blog/a-thought-about-quality Wed, 05 Aug 2015 22:45:23 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=4130 Hmmm, this started with a thought risen by a book, but it drifted quite far, and perhaps never answered the question.
 
 From Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance:
 "Quality from the marketplace and predicted the changes that would take place. Since quality of flavor would be meaningless, supermarkets would carry only basic grains such as rice, cornmeal, soybeans and flour; possibly also some ungraded meat, milk for weaning infants and vitamin and mineral supplements to make up deficiencies. Alcoholic beverages, tea, coffee and tobacco would vanish. So would movies, dances, plays and parties."
 
 - When I stay in one place for some time, get into habit (usually for work, but also if I just become bored or nearby, accessible things), I become a very functional person. I eat simple, healthy, vegetarian meals, with multi-vitamins. I watch a film once or twice a week.
 
 - When I returned to Taipei, it seemed I wanted to live the most functional life, making the right decision every time. In addition to simple living habits, I desired the society around me to naturally partake my own simple living habits.
 
 - At times in my life, I become anxious when I see privledged people waste money on things of quality, especially when the cost of labor for it is so high [and now likely in another country]. I didn't care for the coffee shop Pan's friend was interested in. I didn't care for Meng's major, which wasn't functional. At the time, I was thinking about how to help people in nearby developing countries, those in poor areas in Taiwan, and even those poor people nearby, in Taipei. How can one think of quality when there's so much functional work to do?*
 
 - This kind of thinking leads to a life with Kant's Imperative (Rorshach). Constant steps in a positive direction. The constant decision-making leads to an extremely active life, learning whatever that is needed to reach the next goal. Perhaps the steps may be small, but they are positive, and practical. During this way of thinking, I often do not believe anything past these small steps, sticking close to reality, and taking actions based on experience, as opposed to theory. It's possible I'm unable to relate to any kind of media because the language of it (verbal, visual, etc.) is so distanced from reality. I'm limited to documentaries, biographies, and philosophy and science (including Wikipedia). I choose real experiences. But this leads to a peculiar education. I'm able to choose steps in the right direction, because I know from experience, but I don't know what the rest of the world is doing, and fail to use the knowledge of gained by others. I try to build knowledge from the random scraps of experience I've had, instead of using someone else's solution. It's the only way to learn. But it is unguided knowledge. The knowledge is real, far better than the knowledge people obtain after the Information Age, but it's still random. I get caught up in the obtainment of knowledge, realize it, and go back to functional steps toward the right direction. What's better than gaining knowledge about the practical work one does?* Perhaps the only time I am stable in life is when I have a goal that is lengthy, and feel the work is practical.
 
 - But with the poor decision-making of humans, politics will always show it's head, and that feeling of being somewhat useful to a community disappears, because the work feels useless. This shifts me from technical problems to more socio-political problems. The same Kantian ethics apply. Instead of building a program to prevent bank fraud, it shifts to building civic media -- guiding people to make better decisions for the society as a whole, organizing communities, civil disobedience, and so on.
 
 - Both kinds of work are necessary and practical, but it often feels that at this point in time, especially in a modern country, the social problems outweigh technical. [stopped here* thinking whether building a water resorvoir in Africa is better than influencing a city-society to share]
 
 - Back to the question, How can one think of quality when there's so much functional work to do? Functional work often does not require much of the brain. At these times, if one can fit in Quality in the work, or elsewhere in the world so be it. Off-time is spent on Quality, for example, decorating a house or shop. It's unnecessary, but people get stuck, often physically, in places, boredom arises, and Quality is added to the world. [stopped again, here]
 
 "We would all use public transportation. We would all wear G.I. shoes. A huge proportion of us would be out of work, but this would probably be temporary until we relocated in essential non-Quality work. Applied science and technology would be drastically changed, but pure science, mathematics, philosophy and particularly logic would be unchanged. Phćdrus found this last to be extremely interesting. The purely intellectual pursuits were the least affected by the subtraction of Quality"
 
 - I don't care much for taste, but I do care for design, which may fall under applied science, though maybe everything that isn't science would fall under such a broad term. There's a lot of wasted effort in applied science and technology, but the physical design of the world is something worthy to strive for change. Does the Quality of design matter?* Would an entirely functional world be ideal? The difference between Japan's and Taiwan's societies come to mind. The Quality of design of the world would affect the Quality of life. One cannot design of Quality for some one else, as everyone's interpretation of quality differs (think of someone designing an apartment for another; this example works for the two previous statements). If the only goal to society were to survive, the quality of design may not matter much. Wait, no, even now survival is still a problem...(broke into the following two thoughts).
 
 1. The designs are based on knowledge, and knoweldge of humans, i.e. the social sciences, are infinitely complex. Using the house example again, a house (good or bad in quality) (link to poorly-designed upgrades game) may lead to other unknown problems. This would lead to the solving of those problems, and leading to more unknown problems. By this constant trial and error, the house becomes better. And this is how societies progress, through policy-making. Quality, here, is not a variable.
 
 2. Striving to increase survival is functional, absence of Quality (in an impossible environment where there is no chance of the thought of doing and thinking of something beyond survival). It is beyond survival, one has more time to have more 'higher-functioning' brain activity, which is where Quality enters. Without Quality, Marx's idea of Communism comes to mind, and does indeed seem to be the ideal society. Yet, Quality leads to the creation of more effective (and beautiful) solutions, for example, using games for education, as opposed to rote learning with written language. Perhaps Quality comes later in society just as it does in humans. The first step is to survive. Then next is to do it beautifully. And back in a loop I go. I must sleep. 4130 2015-08-05 18:45:23 2015-08-05 22:45:23 open closed a-thought-about-quality publish 0 0 post 0 Aesthetics Philosophy Social Philosophy Thoughts _edit_last 1 Self-service Housing http://rahilpatel.com/blog/self-service-housing Mon, 20 Jul 2015 20:51:20 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=4190 Somewhat enclosed space with a donation box. Water, mosquito net or walls, air conditioner (with off timer) if completely enclosed.
 
 In more natural places, a gazebo with an outdoor bathroom. Perhaps a public bookcase, for sharing experience and knowledge to others.
 
 In less natural places, any enclosed space. Korean spas (jimjibang) are exemplary. Loft-like space with hardwood floors, shared bathrooms, lockers, [re-usable? / easy to wash] pillows and matts. Perhaps that example is too large. Shrink that example, and it still works. A room with hardwood floor (with pillow and mats), locker, shower room.
 
 Isn't this what capsule hostels do?
 
 This idea is good for traveling to remote parts (hiking paths, paths to remote villages), or when traveling alone, or when traveling with a group of friends.
 
 This idea is bad for those expecting an organization, a space with a vibe set by the owners, with a certain class of people to socialize with. 4190 2015-07-20 16:51:20 2015-07-20 20:51:20 open closed self-service-housing publish 0 0 post 0 Urban Philosophy _edit_last 1 Self-service Work http://rahilpatel.com/blog/self-service-work Tue, 21 Jul 2015 21:04:59 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=4192 Perhaps an idea for more <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/autonomy-of-taiwan">autonomous societies</a> is to create a <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/self-service-housing">self-service house</a> with a job attached to it. It could simply be a space with instructions for work on a sheet of paper inside of it.
 
 The work is likely something local. Natural resource gathering jobs came to my mind first, for example: gather honey, fishing, cleaning the environment, farming (requires some scheduling), most materialistic jobs, most natural science gathering (material analyzing / data gathering) jobs.
 
 Work exchange (helpx, workaway, etc.) are nice, but usually only pay for accommodation and some food. The cost of transport, insurances, visa fees, some food, and other living expenses is an expense of the volunteer. In every case the volunteer loses money. Socially it can be an amazing experience, but in the end, it's temporary because of the cost.
 
 People can freely enter and leave the space, and freely begin and end the work. The job would give the temporary worker profit (be part of the economy) yet still be independent. This would allow people to live and work in many different areas and fields, generate wealth, all whilst having an <a href="https://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/philosophy/works/us/an-experience.htm">experience</a>. 4192 2015-07-21 17:04:59 2015-07-21 21:04:59 open closed self-service-work publish 0 0 post 0 Urban Philosophy _edit_last 1 _wp_old_slug self-service-work-exchange The Infinite Amount of Information of the City http://rahilpatel.com/blog/the-infinite-amount-of-information-of-the-city Mon, 12 Jan 2015 04:26:20 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=4496 A digression from the end of <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/the-limits-of-my-language">The Limits of my Language</a>.
 
 When I think of New York City. I think of an infinite amount of information that I actually have, of ethnic enclaves, buildings, waterways, shops, streets, people, interactions, technology, places of art, places of education, districts, and so on.
 
 Just walking through it is enough.
 
 I think about how I could live in Sunset Park, a Chinatown. How Chinatowns are developed autonomously by Chinese immigrants. How hipsters use the low cost of living to start businesses and studios on a nearby street. How the Chinese parents came here to provide an education for their children. Their children enjoying the knowledge of New York, while satisfied with the simple pleasure of eating Korean fried chicken.
 
 I think about the millions of useless jobs, especially related to government (and those that Veblen said: religion, sports, education). How that money is paid by imperialistic wars.
 
 I think about the millions of immigrants working long hours at restaurants and lower paid jobs to merely pay for rent, the concept of which seems feudal.
 
 I watch a homeless Asian lady live off of the plastic bottles she snatches from trash cans [for non-recycables], and think of the culture that built such a humble nature. Her belongings in her cart. Her routes determined by experience. Her home under the bridge with the rest.
 
 Hipsters in Williamsburg create commercial works for companies for big money, and to feed their creativity. The Financial district, a ghost town except during lunch.
 
 The Orthodox Jews and their families between Williamsburg and Bedford. Very familial, traditional. Their synagogue reminds me of my childhood temple.
 
 The artists that know all of this, trying to better society, but can only react to all this external stimuli by making art outside of the institutions, and for the most part, the city.
 
 This is only a bit of what I think of now, being away for five months. A page can’t describe a city. I think of a lot more once I’m in it. Yet even when I’m in it, it’s still impossible to describe it.
 
 To describe New York, one would need to understand all of the people in it, their cultures and history, the history of the city itself, the government, American culture, all up to its current state.
 
 Some people organize the knowledge into small subjects. Some people make art that reflects it, which allows other people to gain knowledge from it.
 
 Jane Jacobs wrote some urban planning ideas about her experience in New York. But even to write ideas about urban planning, one must know of the people in it, and their cultures, and their traditional ways of living.
 
 All we can do is observe, gain a bit more knowledge, and act upon it, or not. 4496 2015-01-11 23:26:20 2015-01-12 04:26:20 open closed the-infinite-amount-of-information-of-the-city publish 0 0 post 0 Mind and Matter New York Philosophy _edit_last 1 _wp_old_slug image-of-the-city _wp_old_slug the-infinite-amount-information-of-the-city Why are arts segregated? http://rahilpatel.com/blog/why-are-arts-segregated Tue, 08 Sep 2015 20:16:53 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=3646 [note: this thought with the topic on 2/12/2014 (d/m/y), but written on 8/9/2015]
 
 The same could be said for any educational department, knowledge, people, but perhaps art is a good place to start.
 
 No wait, let's start with education.
 
 <h2>Segregation of Education</h2>
 It's baffling that education is so organized. At the time I was in New York, only two programs fit my interest at that time: ITP and Design and Technology. Those were perhaps the top two programs in design and new media, or more broadly, design and technology. Few programs elsewhere in America had it. As a person without a academic background that tends to live in public places -- shared apartment, hostel, communes -- and works in public places -- hackerspaces, voluntary organizations --, I've always found this limiting, and one of the main reasons to not attend a university program. If the program itself is narrow, it will attract people with a narrow set of interests and perhaps even wisdom.
 
 As broad as those two programs are, it misses out on much of the humanities -- philosophy (especially of ideals), sociology, politics, cognition, human geography --, of design -- urban planning, knowledge of materials --, and of other cultures and other people. Though that's probably too much to fit in any single program, it sure does suck being unable to take classes from any of these interests, combining various fields to input a bunch of junk in the mind, with the hope of outputting something good.
 
 I also find it amazing that people are able to decide a year in advance what they are going to do. Do people not have experiences which may change their interests? I applied for one program, but by the time it came, I was interested in another, and there way nothing I could do -- unable to change programs nor add interested classes. If even the most progressive school won't allow it, then I must conclude that self learning is currently the best option.
 
 Okay, enough crying about fantastic ideals. Parson's is great...if one could afford it. :P
 
 Now then, let's try the arts.
 
 <h2>Segregation of Arts</h2>
 As a person who grew up in suburban America in the 90's, I think it's normal to play games, watch films, and read comic books. But again, the arts are segregated, often into communities beyond academic departments, into city meetups and groups. When I was young, it never made sense why one couldn't appreciate and be able to create all of these things. I liked Watchmen, neorealism films, and all games. In what department would Banksy fit? I was pressed to choose between pursuing games and film, when they are of the same. [Limiting art to my knowledge of it in high school, primarily mediums. It must be reminded I grew up in suburban America.]
 
 New Media is not new. Media is just material put together that gives a sensory experience.
 
 The more pragmatic, art as experience, fluxus, sort of things, seemed to be non-existant.
 
 Instead of choosing an art, I chose the city.
 
 <h2>The Paradoxical Desire of Diversity in Organization</h2>
 Just as organizing knowledge leads to specialization, organization of people leads to narrow-mindedness, but without it, how does one ever effectively work, perhaps even honing their craft?
 
 I prefer being with the most diverse (in all senses) people, but [beyond survival] how would they work together?
 
 From my experience, it will work out, at least, for a short period. Perhaps they will fall into old habits and back into their shared interest social groups (knowledge, culture, kinship), but for the moment, they will force themselves to be pushed together to do something. That force is an active, conscious one. It is up to people to actively push themselves into each other to create new experiences. The result is a diverse new experience (including product), with a greater chance of going in a new direction. This process of pushing people together should be repeated. To stop is to become passive, unconscious. 3646 2015-09-08 16:16:53 2015-09-08 20:16:53 open closed why-are-arts-segregated publish 0 0 post 0 Art Philosophy of Education _edit_last 1 _yoast_wpseo_primary_category medium_post O:11:"Medium_Post":11:{s:16:"author_image_url";s:74:"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/200/200/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png";s:10:"author_url";s:28:"https://medium.com/@rahil627";s:11:"byline_name";N;s:12:"byline_email";N;s:10:"cross_link";s:2:"no";s:2:"id";s:12:"b8e9d596e5ed";s:21:"follower_notification";s:3:"yes";s:7:"license";s:19:"all-rights-reserved";s:14:"publication_id";s:2:"-1";s:6:"status";s:6:"public";s:3:"url";s:65:"https://medium.com/@rahil627/why-are-arts-segregated-b8e9d596e5ed";} Tools for Autodidacts http://rahilpatel.com/blog/tools-for-autodidacts Sun, 16 Aug 2015 15:25:01 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=4141 After writing an e-mail to the creator of Voice Dream, it triggered a thought about tools, which may be an extension of <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/tools-for-organizing">Tools for Organizing</a>, probably not <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/tools-for-disorganizing">Tools for Disorganizing</a>, but this time specifically for learning.
 
 Organizing education? Organizing knowledge. Organizing people.
 
 <h2>Organizing Knowledge</h2>
 Though human languages are unnecessary to gain information, they do seem helpful in organizing information. And for that, we need tools to help this. And for the nomadic peoples, carrying bulky notebooks and pencils is a burden. For us privileged peoples, we likely have a smartphone, and I've been using it as a personal library, a public library, a notebook, and a public-facing notebook. <strong>My current set of digital tools to replace these physical entities are, in order, an eBooks folder in Dropbox, digital libraries (such as Project Gutenberg and <a href="http://gen.lib.rus.ec/">Library Genesis</a>), a notes folder in Dropbox full of text files used in conjunction with ByWord text editor, and Wordpress.</strong> All of which have excellent iOS applications.
 
 This covers written language, but what about other mediums to help organize information? Audio: There probably is no good way to record, playback, and re-edit audio. [todo: this tool is necessary for deaf and/or mute people***]. Pictures: One can take pictures with their phone and post it on Wordpress quite easily. Illustrating: One perhaps could use a drawing application to create sketches (I personally feel iPhone is too small for this, and I don't like carrying an iPad, though the iPad mini is a possibility. Maybe Google Glass will have something to illustrate with arm movement?) and also post them on Wordpress. Video: can be taken on the phone and posted on Wordpress. Touch: ? (todo: I think MIT Media lab's tangible media [research] group had a prototype for this. Useful for the deaf and blind?). Other ways to convey ideas digitally, and somewhat efficiently?
 
 <h2>Organizing People</h2>
 Though autodidacts were probably historically secluded, it doesn't have to be so anymore. With ideas such as public spaces and public education more prevalent in cities, it's not so difficult to organize a class (aka workshop?) or a meetup. And even if not, surely one has the guts to publicly talk to anyone, anywhere.
 
 On the tech side, public spaces appear the form in hackerspaces and fablabs, with the appropriate tools and spaces. I happen to know these spaces because I know a bit about tech, but I wonder of the billions of public spaces people convene for whatever their interests are. Taiqi and squaredancing in neighborhood parks, neighborhood development meetups in meeting halls, crafting next to the Han river, illustrating on Yangmingshan mountain, and so on. These spaces really need to be mapped out and thrown on a pretty website. Or should it? Perhaps these past few weeks of seclusion has made me more digitally oriented, and missing out on my physical orientation. If a group wants to be physically inviting, there will be an inviting physical sign. Otherwise, it requires the individual to be active to find and butt into the group.
 
 Just yesterday while hunting Semiotext(e) books on the web, I stumbled upon <a href="http://thepublicschool.org/">The Public School</a>, and <a href="http://www.telic.info/node/35">a group had a curriculum that took place at a different location in the city every day</a>. A side thought: It's nice to see such communities being created in cities across the world, with the community as the core of their philosophies. Anyway, I've thought of this idea before, but it's nice that there is a website for this kind of stuff, as opposed to a messy mix of Facebook, Meetup, Twitter, Google Docs, and whatever else. Though, I'm sure this website has it's limitations too. <a href="http://babycastles.com/website/people/">Kunal</a> is working on <a href="http://better.space/"> a tool for organizing "pop-up collaboration spaces" too</a>. Actually this kind of tool doubles as a <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/tools-for-disorganizing">tool for disorganizing</a>, for ad hoc activism.
 
 Any space can work in theory: one's own apartment, a friend's apartment, a gazebo in a park, a public library, a subway station, a trains. Any space with a door fee goes against my values. From personal experience, this can be practically difficult, as landlords may not like it, roommates may not like it, or my air conditioner is not strong enough and outside is unbearable (Taipei problems), the space is too far from the center of the city. To have a calming space in such a loud city really is a commodity, one that people would pay an over-priced coffee. Ah, I miss those small towns I've travelled through. When a town is comfortable, every space has so much more potential.
 
 The heat of Taipei really does force people to go indoors for such activities. It led me to think about designing some kind of physical pop up space. For example, find a few benches in the public, then setup a plastic physical, clear, box, with a portable air conditioner. Boom! A public space that is comfortable. Taipei has enough public bathrooms and cheap foodstuffs, so that part is covered. But then, electricity is missing. Oh the woes of digital work.
 
 Though, in practice, if the content is valuable, people will come, and people will eventually figure out how to organize themselves, even if it means stuffing themselves in a small room just to be together and talk, or dance.
 
 But that leads to the problem of people moving far distances for finding like-minded peoples, as opposed to staying put in their own neighborhood (or town or even city[!]) and organizing, and teaching, and inspiring people more local to participate. Ah, such idealism.
 
 Eh, well, this part of the post kind of diverted a bit into perhaps a post I will title the Ideal Public Space, which will come later.
 
 But I feel that these thoughts make it apparent that the tools for organizing information are, at the moment, better than tools for organizing people. Hah, doesn't that singularly summarize a major problem with humans? 4141 2015-08-16 11:25:01 2015-08-16 15:25:01 open closed tools-for-autodidacts publish 0 0 post 0 Media Philosophy of Education Social Philosophy Urban Philosophy _edit_last 1 _yoast_wpseo_primary_category medium_post O:11:"Medium_Post":11:{s:16:"author_image_url";s:74:"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/200/200/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png";s:10:"author_url";s:28:"https://medium.com/@rahil627";s:11:"byline_name";N;s:12:"byline_email";N;s:10:"cross_link";s:2:"no";s:2:"id";s:12:"8e141648d2a6";s:21:"follower_notification";s:3:"yes";s:7:"license";s:19:"all-rights-reserved";s:14:"publication_id";s:2:"-1";s:6:"status";s:6:"public";s:3:"url";s:63:"https://medium.com/@rahil627/tools-for-autodidacts-8e141648d2a6";} The Speed of Ideas http://rahilpatel.com/blog/the-speed-of-ideas Sat, 15 Aug 2015 16:00:48 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=4182 I believe this was thought around the time of writing my first post when I went home after my long travels, which was in the form of an illustration because I felt no reason to write as the time to took to record an idea and the speed it conveyed it was so much slower than reality. The following posts were MS Paint quality illustrations of new media ideas, and even that, I felt, was too slow, or not worthwhile, as opposed to executing an idea to reality. Though, in retrospect, the illustrations were quite efficient, in both ways: recording and conveying.
 
 Update 9/3/15:
 Hmm, seems to rehash old ideas: <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/information-media-and-education">Information, Media, and Education</a>, <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/information-organization-mediums-creativity-and-experience">Information Organization, Mediums, Creativity, and Experience</a>, <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/the-obsolescence-of-literature-and-the-future-of-education">The Obsolescence of Literature and the Future of Education</a>.
 
 ~9/17/14:
 
 I never liked books, and in the digital age, it's rare one ever needs to resort to one.
 
 I think the reason, in addition it simply being slow at displaying information, is that is it slow at conveying ideas [or perhaps I'm dyslexic?].
 
 Poetry is a step up [I thought of Calvino's Invisible Cities]. Within a few words, new settings and new ideas form. Though, it requires substantial experience for merely a few words to convey an idea.
 
 Other media is a bit more difficult to compare, because there's far more experience to it.
 
 8/25/15:
 
 Films are an experience. There's infinite information to take in, nearing reality. Whereas reading a Wikipedia is not an experience, assuming one has read an article in the past.
 
 Yet, films (or any other media) can be a learning experience, in which several ideas can be derived from it. During my film-heavy education, I would watch a film, sit, think, read a bunch of Wikipedia articles, maybe see what Ebert says, and write in my thoughts file. Nowadays, I just write thoughts directly to my thoughts file while watching the film, or pause to check some historical information.
 
 If learning is about learning [the gist of] ideas, not content, then the speed of the transmission of ideas should be maximized. But when does one have enough experience to create or understand an idea? That is up to the person. People should experience life as is, only opting to verbalize at their own pace, at their own interest. That is life. Forget the books. Verbalizing everything would requires several lifetimes.
 
 A curriculum should focus on giving experience which would lead to certain ideas without ever using a language.
 
 Films (videos and animations) can be clipped to convey an idea with an experience.
 
 Real experience, however, is much more difficult to make into a curriculum, but could be quite fun to create using travel (including locally) and guided activities (including games).
 --
 Though, a preferred method is to verbalize (and perhaps read more) about what one experiences, mixing the two (thank goodness for Wikipedia!), I wonder about comparing walking through a chaotic city and reading several books from a library.
 
 It is possible to walk through a chaotic city and think about nothing, or almost nothing (i.e. what to eat and drink). It's also possible to think about everything, questioning every human action of every inhabitant and of the organization of all material. The information is infinite.
 
 During the reading of several books, words invoke meaning which may invoke a memory or experience. It all depends on past experiences. The information is finite, and if one does not have enough experience, especially of social related things, things may not make sense. The information is finite.
 
 It also depends on interest of what one reads. The mind hones in on what is interesting, also depending on past interests. Then again, the same process happens in reality. Unless one just allows the world to pass and consume everything that comes by. Still, it requires attention.
 
 A great strength of written work is big history. Mapping time to events. But many other medias can convey this too, so it's not limited to writing. So, it isn't a comparison between reading and experiencing, rather, media and experience.
 
 So, to update the question, let's compare walking through a chaotic city with consuming media.
 
 Cities are organized though, like media. People choose to go to some place based on physical organization.
 
 Let's update the question to walking through a city without intention and consuming media, also without intention. Which will grasp ideas faster?
 
 Formal knowledge can be entirely learned through written language. Social knowledge (anything with humans) requires a lot of experience. Physical knowledge doesn't require much experience. And that is the order of speeds that people can grasp ideas from media.
 
 Hmm, when walking through a city, one could think about many things rarely written about, say, how neighborhoods seem to attract people with similar values, or what components make a good public space. Sure, there's an urban planning book now about these things, but in the past there wasn't. So there's this problem of lack of awareness, knowledge (in case of books: words), and the loss of information from artist to medium. Compare an [good] old media to a new one. The new one is likely to be aware of a lot more things going on. In books, this comes in words. In film, it's in complexity, realism comes to mind.
 
 Rereading the first sentence: when walking through a city, one could think about many things never written about. This is how ideas are created.
 
 Ugh, a bit tired for now, and still haven't answered this question, and diverted slightly from the main topic, the speed of ideas.
 
 I initially thought I could gauge the speeds of each medium (book, film, game, new media), and experience, attacking books again in favor of newer media.
 
 Ah an attack! When I say reading, I was thinking of non-fiction, because I don't read literature. I don't read for experience, if it counts as such. The largest difference is between the length of a book and a film. Two hours or six hours, or more in my case (I'm a slow reader). This is why I always choose reality and film over literature. I have not read any literature since Harry Potter (which was a slog, forced by school, and read between playing video games). Only philosophical fiction and maybe fiction about philosophy are as far as I go from non-fiction.
 
 With a film, I can pause, think (say, question the social reality of the film), continue, just as I do with a book. But it still goes far faster than a book, because all of descriptions are visually displayed. Same goes for comics.
 
 So, films, just as reality, visually display infinite information, therefore offer infinitely more experience  -- I remember being so focused on films, but could never a flip through book. But experience isn't ideas, and the speed of ideas, the speed of transmitting ideas from medium to persons, perhaps cannot be gauged after all...

 <blockquote>The second argument I remember pondering about was about people having a natural want for nature. Living in a small town rather than a city. Mimicing nature in cities: greenery, space, pets; or just having a dwelling in a rural area (Yilan). It said it should only take 10 minutes to get to a farm. That is very ideal, and very far fetched for New York and Taipei. But not too bad for small town cities like San Francisco and Penang. Indeed these small towns are most comfortable</blockquote>
 It's opposite of Veblen's functional life, which would argue that even Hong Kong's past Walled City is okay. It argues that humans, as any other animal, need nature (in the form of farms). Both argue humans mimic the aesthetic of farm life in cities. Perhaps not necessary, but not much is, as humans will try to survive.
 
 In my past, I've stopped and gathered my thoughts in many small towns and calm neighborhoods. Both have space for me to organize. In the first, I still consume, hike, bicycle, scooter around, until I sit and begin organizing it into something creative. In the second, perhaps walking is enough. Work goes as a steady pace, no deadline, like life, life grazing. It feels good, but eventually, the crave for more complexity comes, and after a month I go back to the city. When I was young, and had no city, I believe I turned to the Internet and video games.
 
 I do tend to burn out in cities, but it often only requires a weekend to recover. During that weekend, it is quite nice to escape to a mountain or bike all day, but not necessary. It's just a change in awareness that is enough. Walk down another street  or park or any kind of open space without the pressure of work, and nature doesn't seem to be needed.
 
 So, people can survive, but then the problem is that it isn't reality, and people should have the experience of going to nature. This is why people need nature, especially children, but also adults as a reminder. To avoid creating habits of destroying the environment, and see what is required to upkeep the city.
 
 Hmm, I guess I somehow mixed what is necessary (the extents of human survival) and what is ideal. <strong>Nature is not necessary, but it is ideal.</strong>
 
 Therefore, cities should aspire to design with nature in mind. Cities should have quick and affordable transport to nature. 4195 2015-08-13 04:25:52 2015-08-13 08:25:52 open closed is-nature-necessary publish 0 0 post 0 Urban Philosophy _edit_last 1 Working Memory and Creativity http://rahilpatel.com/blog/working-memory-and-creativity Tue, 08 Sep 2015 21:07:20 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=4361 [todo: just published some old drafts, this is very important for creative work]
 
 [I didn't write anything, but I believe I was getting at how creativity depends on the things in working memory, and how that interacts with long-term memory. For example, say you watched neorealism film in the recent past, then you have some intense travel experience, you may want to try to make a neorealist film.
 
 I think I was also thinking about how design jams work. If one has knowledge of sensors in the mind, then has some experience, then forces oneself to try to design something with the experience in the working memory.]

Now that I'm a bit more focused, my readings have become focused too, chosen based on past experiences and interests, before I began reading.
 
 Though it does seem quite useless, impractical, lacking good use of working memory, and surely doing this out of current poor habit, over-organizing because I'm not in an active city, space, or social area, I've found that in the past, during downtime or simultaneously with work I end up consuming what media I do have most conveniently available -- my smartphone -- and so having some interesting media, is sometimes worth the trouble.
 
 After writing down a few books of interest, it seems the theme of my interest is experience. If one is not experiencing, perhaps in a situation where creating experience is difficult, or one is simply in a lazy mode, perhaps books about experience will make one want to experience again, or remind oneself of one's past experiences. Contrarily, if one is experiencing, then the books can be read simultaneously, and actually learn something from a book.
 
 Hahahaha jk, <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/no-more-writing">books suck</a>. If you must, let it be a practical handbooks and Wikipedia articles.
 
 <h2>Update 17/9/15</h2>
 It seems that this post, like the <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/valuable-things-ive-written">organized things I've written</a>, is ever evolving. It started with creating a library related to experience, but as I used Wikipedia to <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/no-more-writing">attach words to ideas I've previously thought of</a>, I've created an endless library of things I'll never read. Though paradoxical, again, like the organized things I've written post, it turns out to be seemingly useful. Useful in the organization of ideas, but, as I often previously fought against during more active times in life, organization of ideas is not useful, it only seems so. 1) There is no need. The ideas exist, and always have since their inception. Instead of using time reading Wikipedia to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_metaphor">map ideas to words</a> as I just did here, I could be having experiences, creating new ideas, affecting the world, being a part of society. 2) It is uncreative. I could be creating my own words, which is an experience itself. 3) The use of vocabulary is limited to academics, making it inaccessible to the public. 4) The use of vocabulary influences others to conform to it, leading to the creation of a singular language... It's circular logic, and it wastes real social time. It's passive learning. One doesn't need to know the political term or history of autonomism to understand it; If one can imagine an autonomous society, for example, most towns in Japanese role-playing video games, it is enough. Furthermore, along with the mapping of words to ideas, a useless history of philosophy often comes about. Only the mapping is what was seemingly important, nothing else. One should spend no further time on it. A google search of the description of an idea and appending "Wikipedia" to it usually suffices. If not, make a word up for it.
 
 <h2>Update 27/11/15</h2>
 It seems much of readings have shifted from experience toward critical theory, probably first as a result of wanting to describe the world, then later from being lazy and not experiencing and over-organizing.
 
 <h2>Update 23/12/15</h2>
 <a href="http://peopleplacespace.org/toc/">The People, Place, and Space Reader</a> may be the closest description of the world and mind to my mind. Just a look at Simmel's "Metropolis and the Mental Life" harks <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/valuable-things-ive-written#early">my early philosophy</a>, which I wrote after much city experience. Previously, I thought David Harvey came closest, and before that, more classical critical theorists, but a glance at Harvey's books one quickly learns that he relies on past human geographers and critical theorists and quotes them a lot to build a philosophy of human geography, and a glance at classical critical theorists one gets lost in the critiques of everything, failing to synthesize it with the contemporaneous world, especially the modern city. Forget classic philosophy canons (epistemology [maybe even pragmatism!] and political philosophy); Forget written language (save these essays). In the search of talking to someone about somethings, I've been distracted and misled by philosophy, distracted during the search for subjects that I wanted to talk about, misled by people who use past philosophers to help them write in a kind of infinite regression, and to larger forms of writings, which are more frequently mentioned in Wikipedia and sometimes even more easier to download (problem with digitization of essays and journals?), as opposed to contemporary concise essays and journal articles. God damn it. What a waste of time. Perhaps reading one essay from this book per week is enough. So glad the weather is warm now.
 ...
 Still, this is only a small portion of my mind; It's merely only the passive side. It's missing the entire creative, active portion: creating public spaces, new media political city art, tools for society, urban material ideas, and so on, for that political end of increasing the freedom for others. I'm happy that such a book exists, but such an academic organization is quite useless compared to an active social organization that continuously deals with society, and the things that come out of the process -- the realization of ideas with the aforementioned political ends.

 From my ebook playlist:
 
 towards social change via geography:
 Society in Time and Space: A Geographical Perspective on Change by Robert Dodgshon
 - provides a good overview of the social change debate. The last chapter is the main social change reading, though, the history chapter looks fun too. Other chapters include how culture (and symbolization), built environment, and organization affect social change.
 
 environmental social science:
 1.***** <a href="http://peopleplacespace.org/toc/">The People, Place, and Space Reader</a>
 - see <a href="#update_23-12-15"> this recent thought which was a reaction to the discovery of this selection of essays</a>, which notes the like-mindedness and importance of these essays to my mind
 - <a href="http://peopleplacespace.org/frr/">further recommended readings</a>, though there are enough in the introductions to each section of the book

 - Anthropology of Space and Place: Locating Culture by one of the editors of this book, is another collection
 
 cultural theory readings:
 2.*** culture and society: contemporary debates edited by Alexander and Seidman

 Usually thought of while traveling, especially between a developing area and a developed area. It is probably the cause of the onset of philosophic mania.
 
 One wonders, how everything came to be.
 
 How did all of this material accumulate.  How did the knowledge of putting these materials together pass. Who accumulated it. Why were they chosen. Who they where chosen by.
 
 How cities became clones of other cities. How ideas are copied. How narrow the knowledge of a society is.
 
 How people, especially laborers, become spatially and habitually trapped.
 
 And so on.

 Sparked by an old thought which reoccured, in which through the process of writing, other associated old thoughts were found:
 
 For a white collar worker in a developed country during the Information Age, the commodity one creates may be digital, or a service, either way, immaterial.
 
 In Taiwan, a lot of the commodities, perhaps even a majority of the economy, still seem to be material. - [link ideology of Taiwan, materials science, crafting, food].
 
 One may first think that is a sign of lack of progress of honing the rational, but it isn't.
 
 Material commodity is dealt with as with any other manual labor work, but with the prevalence of smartphones, people are able to simultaneously consume, think, socialize of specific interests (including people).
 
 So, although the material commodity is valued, people are still able to gain much non-valued information, through experience and media.
 
 Because much of the commodities are material, it forces people to have more experience with material, reality, as opposed to information, media.
 
 Consistent time with material reality creates experiences, maintains social and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aldo_Leopold#Land_Ethic">land</a> relationships within locality, and fosters a sense of community, for people and the material.
 
 [todo: to be continued?]
 
 --
 
 Some people comment negatively on how people use their smartphones while in the public, with friends, with a loved one. I see it positive, one is able to have both: the social and personal interest.
 
 I absolutely loved the times I picnicked in Asia with friends, doing our individual work in the same physical space.
 
 It fosters a sense of community.
 
 San Francisco kept this sense by taking their laptops into the parks, as did the more communal parts of New York.
 
 Nature is necessary as a free public space. Cafes are a commodity, and should be avoided, as they often add no value (unless the time of being with the people leads to additional human capital. No, cafes are exclusive places, not everyone can afford to be there! Hmm, maybe it's a problem with property.).
 
 --
 
 <strong>Isolation via Desktop Computer</strong>
 
 The problem occurs when people use their digital devices in solitude. This destroys community, harks modern urban planning dystopias.
 
 Perhaps it was the fact that desktop computers were invented first, became prevalent in the homes of those that could afford to, and then, much later, affordable, usable, laptops became available. During this gap in time, a good amount of society may have been clicking away toward their interests, in their isolated bedrooms.
 
 It's natural to be <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/jia-zhangkes-trilogy#attracted_to_organized_information">attracted to knowledge</a>, but not at the cost of eyes on the community.
 
 This period of time was a dark one. Luckily, it didn't take long to change to laptops. Yet, much of America is still stuck in their rooms due to habit, or suburban sprawl (suburban accumulation of capital, lack of public spaces, etc.), a different problem.
 
 It's exemplary to see certain blue collar workers integrate smartphones into their lives and adapt so well, while certain people are still stuck in habit, organizing digital information in their rooms. I often categorize these people in my mind as human and inhuman.
 
 Perhaps if one experienced the simultaneous life, working toward self-interest and being social, one would then try to avoid doing one or the other exclusively from then on.
 
 ...Or, perhaps, this is all just a problem of my inability to control my own time. 4576 2015-09-03 19:50:18 2015-09-03 23:50:18 open closed the-revolution-will-not-be-in-the-bedroom publish 0 0 post 0 Community Mind and Matter Philosophy Social Philosophy _edit_last 1 Is Continental Philosophy a Dead End? http://rahilpatel.com/blog/is-continental-philosophy-a-dead-end Fri, 04 Sep 2015 12:26:32 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=4583 Just finishing an old draft, likely written during Early Philosophy II.
 
 From <a href="http://www.openculture.com/2013/07/slavoj-zizek-responds-to-noam-chomsky.html">a dispute between Chomsky and Zizek</a>:
 <blockquote>“There’s no ‘theory’ in any of this stuff,” Chomsky says to an interviewer who had asked him about the three continental thinkers, “not in the sense of theory that anyone is familiar with in the sciences or any other serious field. Try to find in all of the work you mentioned some principles from which you can deduce conclusions, empirically testable propositions where it all goes beyond the level of something you can explain in five minutes to a twelve-year-old. See if you can find that when the fancy words are decoded. I can’t. So I’m not interested in that kind of posturing. Žižek is an extreme example of it.”</blockquote>
 
 The problem with Continental Philosophy is indeed the use of extra vocabulary to describe certain phenomenon, and it increases linearly as individuals read the canon, making it inaccessible. 
 
 The other problem is that, these people actually do have important ideas on describing social reality, psychology, and cognition. 
 
 But if no one else (especially scientists) talks about these things, who does one turn to? To past Continental Philosophers, and so they internalize past concepts (and words), continue to describe reality, creating more concepts. It seems to be a never ending dead end.
 
 But who does one talk to about these things?
 
 First, Wikipedia, then Stanford's Encyclopedia of Philosophy, then more modern media -- an article on Google, a contemporary book that covers a broader range of things, etc. No one reads science articles to relate experiences to.
 
 Let's compare talking to Daniel Kahneman and Zizek, using their two most recent books, Thinking, Fast and Slow and Parallax View.
 
 Although Daniel Kahneman's book provides a good framework, it was just released recently, otherwise, one would have to look through scholarly articles. Zizek is old, and perhaps his only available non-human sources, or his own education, were these old Continental Philosophers, beginning with Freud.
 
 Though I haven't read Kahneman's book entirely, I found Zizek's material (films and Parallax View) far more engaging, as it is uses film, history, and reality as examples, as opposed to the the dry studies of Kahneman.
 
 So, where Kahneman builds a rational formal system for decision-making, Zizek observes decision-making and ideology in the real world, using the old internalized words from psychoanalysis and Continental Philosophy, especially related <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_mind#Philosophy_of_mind_in_the_continental_tradition">to the mind</a>, to describe it.
 
 If one were trying to figure out the world, especially the social world, would one turn toward a mathematician of the mind or Marx with hyper-awareness of the mind's problems?
 
 Clearly hyper-Marx. It also just shows Zizek is consistently engaged with the world, cares, and is part of the civil society.
 
 Kahneman's stuff may be applied to economics, but Zizek derives decision-making problems from reality: of homelessness, of the space between cultures, of the impossibility of assimilating to a culture, of impossibility of fully understanding another, of the impossibility of politics or any non-human centered design for that matter. These are all experiences I've had, and therefore, it becomes possible for me to reflect and learn something from it, putting words to my experiences, and progressing.
 
 Continental Philosophy won't die because there will always be people questioning the world during their time in it. But is it going somewhere, the way science is?
 
 Yes. I believe as people become more intelligent, more aware, more open, more will be understood of social problems, more words will be created to describe them, and these conversations, especially of critical theory, can be useful in describing reality and social reality, and gauging the direction of human development.
 
 <strong>It's not a dead end. It's the never-ending critique of society, and the will to improve it.</strong>
 --
 
 Another quick thought is of realism films, especially those that are critical of their society, usually labeled under New Wave. They were a huge part of my high school and college education.
 
 I haven't seen one in a long time because I've been so focused on reality, and often feel like using human language, but now it's clear that my past love for these films was the critique of and care for society.
 
 It's life, and there's a problem with it. It's fascinating. It alters the way we think. We respond with want of social action and distribute the idea. It alters the way society thinks.
 
 The problem isn't the content, it's the form. Few people are able to read a huge book, and really engage with it. <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/the-speed-of-ideas">The speed of the transmission of ideas are too slow</a>. For it to be useful, creating a real impact, the idea must be transmitted quickly, into the working memory [todo: link to working memory and creativity], so then the person can take action with these ideas in it.
 
 <strong>Continental Philosophy may not be dead, but <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/no-more-writing">writing sure is</a>.</strong>
 --
 
 The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociology#Central_theoretical_problems">Wikipedia article on Sociology outlines the central theoretical problems</a>: subjectivity and objectivity, structure and agency, and synchrony and diachrony. At least one of these, I feel is important, and make up the core concepts of Continental Philosophy.
 
 Parallax view, uses subjectivity and objectivity, and the void between, then goes on using this structure to critique epistemology and politics.
 
 I haven't read about the other two, but it seems synchrony and diachrony is not in the same league of importance.
 
 <strong>All of the wordy theories on sociology are bullshit because the underlying theories on epistemology, especially philosophy of the mind, are bullshit. These are the dead ends.</strong>
 
 It is worth having dialog about the how these central problems affect reality, especially politics and society, but there is no use of describing the structure of the mind. For that, one can now simply skip to neuroscience, save their worries, and resume pragmatically. 4583 2015-09-04 08:26:32 2015-09-04 12:26:32 open closed is-continental-philosophy-a-dead-end publish 0 0 post 0 Critical Theory Experience Mind and Matter Philosophy Social Philosophy _edit_last 1 Working Memory and Community http://rahilpatel.com/blog/working-memory-and-community Tue, 08 Sep 2015 21:04:44 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=4624 [todo: just publishing old drafts, this one might be worth thinking for human geography]
 
 Old thought.
 
 Working memory is limited. To remind oneself of the community, one must experience it, often. For this reason, living physically close to the community increases physical visibility, which in turn increases physical interaction.
 
 Repeat this and it may become habit.
 
 [I think I was getting at how habit of physical interaction is somewhat required for socialization, maintaining a community] 4624 2015-09-08 17:04:44 2015-09-08 21:04:44 open closed working-memory-and-community publish 0 0 post 0 Human Geography Humanities Philosophy Social Philosophy _edit_last 1 Will to Take Care of Locality http://rahilpatel.com/blog/will-to-take-care-of-locality Sun, 06 Sep 2015 19:41:21 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=4630 Related to Working Memory and Community [todo: need link], <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/will-to-make">Will to Make</a>, <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/will-to-experience">Will to Experience</a>.
 
 [todo: should try to complete!]
 
 The locality is a specific area in space undefinable boundaries. It contains materials, including the living and non-living.
 
 A living thing begins in a locality.
 
 The living thing makes contact with locality. It has an experience with the locality. It may continue, or it may stay.
 
 If the living thing stays, it will take care of the locality.
 
 It may move and stay again and again.
 
 todo:
 Hmmm, this doesn't quite work for living things that trash or destroy places that is not their place.
 
 I think I was trying to define a kind of land ethics often belonging to indigenous peoples, or generally anyone not confined to a very small space i.e. dwelling.
 
 Hmmm, this also seems like a good starting point for private / public locality, property, conduct, and perhaps more.***
 
 Hmmm, my current locality seems to be this blog.

 The affects of audio are really important. I think the only way I was able to spend so much time on the computer in the past, as opposed to taking in all of sensory experience nature offers, is because of music. It has the ability to dull the mind into doing rote tasks. Music should almost always be avoided, except for times when the mind is thinking too much, too manic, and need to just calm down.
 
 While outside:
 none:
 focused on reality
 alert of reality
 
 one ear:
 alert of reality
 listening intently on audio content, if it fits current interests
 
 two ears isolated:
 reality becomes film
 
 
 While in front of a computer:
 none:
 alert of reality nearby
 alert of outside world
 question why I am on the computer as opposed to making an impact in the world
 question why I am not thinking fast
 
 one ear (maybe two ears non-isolated):
 alert of reality nearby
 alert of outside world
 
 two ears isolated.

 <strong>written for OSF and TFD (newer)</strong>:
 
 2.1.1 My Perspective of Taiwan’s Issues:
 Taiwan is a beautiful mess. The feeling of lack of government, enforcement, and social security continues. Even as the country unevenly advances to the most contemporary form of society, it still feels the people must survive on their own. It’s people have leveraged technology as exemplified in the prevalent use of technological knowledge to manufacture high quality products, accommodation and skill-share web services, social media as a primary source for national news, and social media to manage large-scale protests. The alacrity of their adaption to new technology and the strain of low income has resulted in a technological society with survival values.
 
 Though the people have adapted, the government has not. Along with a little normative government ilk, Taiwan’s government has bare digital services for citizens, keeps non-harmful data private, and contains non-sensical policies that aren’t being enforced properly anyway. Thus, it is generally up to the people to manage themselves, which itself has become a common moral and ideology. Though I believe most of the people will be able to survive — have shelter, eat, obtain health services and an education — thanks to civil society, I believe their civic progress will remain scattered outcries without tools to help them direct conversation.
 
 2.1.2 My Belief and Proposal:
 I believe Taiwan’s civil society is active enough to adapt to civic tools, convert conversation to actions, and experiment with technology and methods of social actions, as a means of progress.
 
 My proposal, defined by my personal background, is a civic technology center specialized in (1) the advocation and facilitation of civic technology, and (2) the creation of social and urban interventions.
 
 1. It advocates the use of mobile digital tools, extracts and serves functional civic data in more meaningful forms, and helps organize the useful bits of the infinite civic dialog created through their peculiar digital communication mediums (BBS system and non-Facebook social media) to lead to more effective civic actions. Basically, a Taiwanese sister organization of MIT Center for Civic Media, without the development of technology — leave that to MIT.
 
 2. It serves as a local community hall for the sake of constant personal civil experience, allotting time to solving local social and urban problems, and experimenting new forms of social intervention, urban intervention, and activism on a reoccurring basis.
 
 
 <strong>written to narrow down thoughts for MIT Lab and then used for first draft of TFD (older)</strong>:
 
 Motive:
 In 2013, I volunteered, travelled and lived (any maybe protested) in Taiwan for periods of time. I had good experiences within the society of Taiwan, felt a strong sense of community and civil service, and decided that I will return, with intent to be a part of that positive force.
 
 Past Thoughts:
 The following Ideal Objectives and the Development towards them, were written in the past, but are fitting to see my mind:
 
 Ideal Objectives:
 I want to continue living in Taiwan, manage a public space in a city, collaborate with organizations here, be a part of my neighborhood, city, and country; I want to be a part of the civic decisions that goes on it, make it better by giving people methods to make civic decisions and methods to take action beyond the recent social media leveraged protests, organize reality to help decision-making; help communities maintain themselves by being aware of local problems, encourage people to socialize and collaborate with neighbors, encourage sharing; further autonomy with self-service housing, workspaces, and work; etc. all those ideals.
 
 Development of tools as the method toward ideal objectives,:
 To complete these objectives: there should be tools to help organize people physically and stay up to date with those people digitally, to allow people make civic decisions and take action, to allow people to educate themselves under the circumstances of the current lifestyle, tools to teach community leaders how to organize, to enable community leaders to organize urban data, to match the right solver to the problem; There should be a better designed city to calm people from moving and find people nearby to work with. Simple ideas should exist to facilitate sharing. There should be tools to have local discussion, to corrode corruption; Thanks to Taiwan's solidarity, the autonomy of the country can be furthered with successful examples of the uses of spaces -- housing, education, work, play, and mixes; etc. all those ideal, tools.
 
 On Human Rights and Development:
 From the few travels around Taiwan I am aware of social problems: rampant urban development projects, lack of policy, lack of care of policies, lack of enforcement (what do they do?), prostitution, lack of healthcare on the east coast, land conflicts with indigenous peoples, underpaid migrant workers, etc. I am also aware of current social processes: the accumulation of capital, consumerism, urbanization, globalization (migrant workers, language teachers), etc.
 
 I am willing to make efforts toward many of these problems, but my focus is on organizing knowledge (awareness) and people (action), which reflects my experience in programming, design and technology, and knowledge in urban planning.
 
 Outward Radiation of Work:
 I have a very materialistic, urban-planning, anarchistic (direct democracy is okay!) philosophy that promotes autonomous societies, and so my Rough Outline of Actions radiates spatially outward, from a place to neighborhood to city to country.
 
 Rough Outline of Actions:
 0. See current organizations for experience and determine if any can be used as a public place.
 
 Place:
 1. Create a physical (and digital) public place. It may be possible to take over a current public space, such as TFD, FabLab or some kind of town hall. It must be accessible to a dense urban area, preferably in a working-class neighborhood.
 
 2. Gather organizational information. Leveraging TFD contacts and my friends from the public realm (Hackerspaces, NTU landscape students, social spaces in Gongguan) quickly gather information about Taiwan’s hierarchy of organizations.
 
 *. Hold workshops. There’s no time for teaching, but I think civic-oriented workshops may come to mind, as I have a need for creativity :) . Teach map-making, Wikipedia editing event, problem-solution design jams, protest tactics against government interventions, etc.
 
 Neighborhood:
 *. I will personally be able to detect local problems, social and material, have an experience (as opposed to relying purely on data, including news) and take action against them. For example, prevent automobile traffic from entering market streets, inform lack of walking and biking lanes for the working class, displace people in poor quality rooftop housing. The action could be from policy-making to direct intervention.
 
 4. The public space also serves as a community hall for the neighborhood. It is a place for people to direct social problems to, and a physical (and digital) forum for discussion.
 
 ?. Neighborhood media. Social problems must disperse back to the neighborhood. I haven’t decided how (paper, digital, radio, etc.) yet.
 
 City:
 5. Mapping of existing data. The first tool I believe that’s necessary are maps with data. Whatever the problem may be, the physical areas must be identified. In case the data is stuck in ugly government databases and websites, I can leverage friends from Hackerspaces to help here, or do it myself, putting it into a more modern mapping system, available for public use. There are several good existing technologies for this. Other organizations may benefit from learning how to do this. Maybe Taiwan has this, but I personally know of friends who are scraping data from poorly designed or outdated government websites because they are so bad.
 
 6. Creation and mapping of new data. Next there must be a tool for people to create geopoints of interest to begin a forum of discussion, to centralize conversations.
 
 Taiwanese citizens are often very civic-minded people. They talk about problems, but it is often through personal networks (LINE, Facebook, and BBS), private and unorganizable.
 
 I realize that the stipulation of having a digital device will restrict access to residents, but I also believe it just has to be up to the younger generation to pass information to the non-digital users. (Maybe create a radio station for the non-digital?).
 
 I am actually not sure if there is an existing technology for the first point. MIT’s Action Path is close to the idea, but still quite far in execution. But at the least, something can be done about the BBS.
 
 7. Further tools to enable people to take civil actions where it is beyond their own control. Enable people to be able to directly give real and current information to the right organization i.e. sending a picture.
 
 ?. City media. Thanks to the political problems, I’m guessing there’s a non-corporate online media source already in place, but I wonder how that information can get to the non-digital audience, and furthermore, non-Chinese language audience.
 
 Country:
 *. Follow civic crowdsourcing. Can even try to pass the idea of campaigning for bike and motorcycle helmets, for public bike systems in dense urban areas, for laptops, for public libraries, etc.
 
 8. What successful actions I take locally has a chance to propagate to other localities, and other cities. If they do not naturally propagate, then communication to organizations in other towns may be needed, but not forced.
 
 Feasibility of tools:
 All tools will use existing web and mobile applications. I highly doubt the need of designing anything new.
 
 Direct interventions may not require tools at all, perhaps just a physical sign, or talking.
 
 On Human Rights and Development again:
 I notice that my outline is lacking in human rights. In a country where law enforcement is minimal, therefore rendering many laws useless, I believe working toward better self-governance, education, civil (and ecological) conduct, is better, especially in the case of Taiwan, where the ideology, form my experience, is quite well-natured. For example, if a migrant worker were to come to a clinic without health insurance, I believe it is up to the clinician to do the right thing, and from my experience, this is often positive. More likely the problem, I think, is the lack of resources in less developed areas, in this example, a professionally trained clinician with medicine in the area. 4660 2015-09-07 20:56:09 2015-09-08 00:56:09 closed closed a-project-plan-for-an-urban-area publish 0 0 post 0 Design Engineering Organization Personal Self-assessment Urban Philosophy _edit_last 1 Material Organizations and Autonomy http://rahilpatel.com/blog/material-organizations-and-autonomy Sat, 12 Sep 2015 22:18:33 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=4712 If <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/chaos-and-organization">human minds are organizing things</a>, material organization is one method to satisfy that <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/creativity-as-organization-from-chaos">desire</a>. Material includes digital bits, the education of a child, and societies at all scales [todo: does it?]. But for now, let's focus on the material.
 
 Humans under capitalism are forced to trade labor for money. [Labor likely ultimately creating a commodity.] When a person gathers enough wealth to survive, it is up to the person to decide whether to become <a href="http://www.zpub.com/notes/idle.html">idle</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_accumulation">accumulate capital</a>. Out of the human tendency to fall under habituation, the latter is more likely, especially in less dynamic urban areas. [The accumulated capital then can be saved, spent on commodities, spent on charity, etc.]
 
 The material world can be separated into organization of material. Sometimes organized for the ends of: an ideal environment for family (or basic social unit), an ideal environment for everyone (community of any size), profit [todo: missing a lot more?]. Whatever the end, the material exists in the form of dwellings, cities, and waste.
 
 Travel across the land and the places of organized material are clear. Dwellings with tools for living, businesses with tools for creating commodity or servicing, research centers with tools for creating knowledge, comfortable spaces for social activities, empty spaces for creative people: material organizations.
 
 The world in a traveler's eye is beautiful, open, social. All of those material organizations are accessible by simply talking to one another (or persuading another), except with those who lost an important moral from their childhood: sharing.
 
 If everyone shared, would that create a disaster, anarchism, or autonomism?
 
 [The world in an economist's eye is of prices of commodities (assets). One can clearly see the costs of each material organization. The world here could be divided into values per area.]
 
 The willingness to share enables everyone to survive, enables creative people to create more ideas because the awareness of having the ability to use tools directs the mind in more directions and because having the ability to play with tools create experience which leads to creativity, and lastly enables creative people to use the tools for work.
 
 The deprivation of sharing from another requires the duplication of materials, the ownership of said duplicated materials, which together in turn may result in duplicate material organizations [todo: from duplicate houses and business to duplicate suburbs to duplicate societies]. In order for one to create, one must first be willing to act upon an idea, then must second be willing to gather the material to execute it, but, the problem found in the reiteration in the negative: The idea may never come because the lack of experience and ability to play with and use tools.
 
 This isolated society deprived of sharing deprives others from everything organized: organized material (including media which contain knowledge) and organized people. It deprives itself from progressing. It will decay.
 
 Until those willing to share will regenerate it.
 
 [todo: getting sleepy and sloppy]
 In a society with people willing to share, people are enabled to create and therefore most would be creating. There are those professional jobs that require duty: medicine, farming, upkeep of technology (electricity, internet), etc. [todo: what else?]. For everyone else it is caring for community and creation. The creativity is pure, not tainted by capitalism. The excess of commodity is avoided and substituted by better forms of creativity. Because of willingness to share, the awareness of locality, neighbors whom have what tools and knowledge, is heightened. Experiences become more local, as do products of creativity, adding diversity into the mediums. The lack of need to physically move far to create, creates better relationships with others, material tools, and material nature, adding care for natural area. All shared material organizations are cared for because they are willing to share. It's a positive feedback loop...[todo: think more and clean]
 
 In this society, one is able to travel from one material organization to another, learning or becoming aware of organized material and people, likely being able to use the organized materials (tools and materials). The ability to gain materials and tools depends on the social relation, and society's norm of the willingness to share.
 
 One could use materials out of self-interest, but it is less likely one will be able to gain them. It is when people desire to use materials for the interest of society that others are willing to share. What's in the interest of society in the mind of others depends on their mind which depends on what experience in society put in it. One arrives to the individual-collective spectrum. When should a person allow another to use materials for self-interest: creation of art, more tools, consumables, etc.? It is up to the other person... [todo: getting sleepy]
 
 At the least, a society should have the characteristic willingness to share. The difference in mind and wisdom (culture) does not matter. It should be a right. If one is found unwilling to share, that person will be shunned from the community.
 
 Because material organizations have no value, it is the labor that benefits society that does. Not so much in the form of money, but in the recorded history of the individual. When one asks another of their experience, is it labor towards tending society or conspicuous consumption? It's much easier to determine one's value with this spectrum.
 
 With the ability to move from material organization to material organization, one constantly lives in a higher form of awareness, have much in <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/working-memory-and-creativity">working memory to be more creative</a>, have more experiences, being able to at first play for the sake of playing, then narrowing work toward one's interests and creative endeavors.

More thoughts written underneath each thought on 10/3:
 
 Nature, the love of it, the love of child caring, the love of eating fresh fruit, the adventure of hunting, the amazement of craft.
 - I agree with Studio Ghibli in the decision of creating main characters whom are raised closed to nature and grow up with good values, which are never lost.
 
 Gold as currency. Work for capital, work becomes habitualized, work uses a great portion of life. Material and production easily shown in rural area.
 - Education of material before going to the city, where material is focused upon less, even forgotten, because of daily habit of living in an artificial area.
 
 Leaving nature for the city at adolescence.
 - Good coming-of-age film.
 
 Similarities to Lion King, my first favorite film.
 - Indeed, the thieves in the rural area are like Timon and Pumba.
 
 The palace is nothing like nature, an isolation chamber for forced learning, socialization.
 
 Playfulness and games during learning, serious when needed.
 - I was a little giddy when this was clearly added, as Kaguya learns whatever the teacher of manners says, but playfully, and only serious when needed.
 
 Didnt Takahata play the piano? Maybe a little of his childhood is infused in here.
 
 Studies because she wants to, or out of habit?
 
 Culture as a joke, though it exists.
 
 Out of education of culture, can't escape society? Can't be a thief, a beast? Impossible to go back to rural life? Habits too strong? Unwilling to rehabitualize rural life?
 - Showing that Kaguya became socialized to the city's society to the point of being unable to go back and join past rural society was a good decision too. I don't think this conflict occurred in The Lion King.
 - Furthermore, it seemed the thief was viewed as, using Aristotle's term, a beast, a person who lives outside of society. The thief is only a beast to the city's society, as he has his own society.
 
 Three years pass by quietly, in habit, doing nothing? Recreating home in the form of a garden? Art as recreation of home. Art as imitation of nature.
 - Habit will indeed make time pass by without much thinking.
 - Kaguya and her mother recreates home with a garden, but is eventually unsatisfied with the imitation. A sense of belonging. Forced migration? Along with the consistent theme of being raised in nature in Studio Ghibli films, this theme of belonging to nature follows logically, and is equally necessary. It's especially relatable during times of mass urbanization, though, people have always been migrating. Maybe it's natural?*
 
 ...
 
 Mmm boring in the middle, especially with forcing 5 princes, but good near the end.
 
 It's interesting that the moment the Majesty grasps her, her duty comes to mind, signifying a strong feeling of refusal, and resulting in a flash of a vision.
 - It takes a strong action to evoke an equally strong emotional response for the character to be reminded of direction and take action in response. It breaks her out of her habitual life.
 
 The kids and dogs sing their song of beasts and bugs in a different way, mentioning the temporal part of life, "grow and die".
 - In accordance to the recurring theme a natural life, dying is treated as normal, just as any other animal dies, humans die. In this case, Kaguya goes to the Moon, in other words, Kaguya leaves earth, or, she dies, at least for that society. This also may be a helpful way of cooping with death: the acceptance of it.
 
 The Princess actually goes to the Moon. The limit of time shows. Parents cry. She didn't want to go, but she must. The need of being part of society theme from earlier duplicates to another, third society. Born in a farm, raised in the capital, destined to return to the moon. The memory of each society experienced does not leave, and desire, nostalgia exist when living in a new one. Life pushes you in different locations, societies, experience over time, memories are created. Is it fair to those that live in the society, that have done so much to keep it up? Is it normal for people to travel and live in different societies? Is a home necessary? Where is Kaguya's home?
 - This theme of living in different societies, adapting, nostalgia for home, is normal in Ghibli films, but I don't remember socialization being focused as much as it was in this film; One character is a teacher of manners of being a princess, bourgeois culture and habits. This film's themes are indeed align with the Disney golden age classic fairy tales such as Snow White and The Lion King, and it sometimes feels a successor of those films more so than a Studio Ghibli film, which is okay, since Disney stopped making those sort of things. 4844 2015-09-22 16:17:48 2015-09-22 20:17:48 open closed the-tale-of-the-princess-kaguya publish 0 0 post 0 Art Film Reviews Films Humanities _edit_last 1 _yoast_wpseo_content_score 30 _yoast_wpseo_primary_category 天空の城ラピュタ (Laputa: Castle in the Sky) http://rahilpatel.com/blog/laputa-castle-in-the-sky Mon, 28 Sep 2015 13:25:51 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=4872 [todo: review thoughts]
 
 Thoughts during a viewing of Laputa: Castle in the Sky (Japanese: 天空の城ラピュタ, romanization: Tenkū no Shiro Rapyuta):
 
 Beautiful intro production. Feels like Leonardo Da Vinci's notebooks. Perhaps Takahata helped here.
 
 Physical work, in tune with reality, the material world.
 
 Few materials are needed.
 
 Wake up when the sun comes up.
 
 Exploration.
 
 Childhood ambitions.
 
 Always interested in flying. Even the stone allows one to float.
 Far less realistic and cartoon like than The Wind Rises and Kaguya.
 The characters eat egg, will that disappear as civilization progesses?
 
 Created new species of cows.
 
 Always grows up in nature.
 
 In the cave they drink from the river and cook their own meal.
 The exploration of the underground is equivalent to the exploration of space.
 
 The rocks underground in harmony with the sky.
 
 A nice old rugged single traveler.
 
 Characters in Miyazaki's films are never afraid to meet strangers, shows many forms of humanity
 
 Sublime clouds.
 
 A castle in the sea is of the army. It includes a prison.
 Organization of humans to explore Laputa, sounds like the space program.
 
 The army, pirates, and government in search of treasure, alike.
 Like Kaguya, the princess suddenly came into the world, from another, but grew up on Earth.
 
 Can one go back into habit of life and forget the past?
 
 Pirates, guerrilla warfare.
 
 The boy's pets are birds. Care shown through caring of pets, as the characters don't have younger siblings.
 
 Destructive science, useless war machines.
 
 Lol, material jobs given to kids, indeed such a pain. Though, a bit generalizing of women's work, quite in contrast with the grandma pirate.
 
 Like JRPGs, Miyazaki's a one's are a good way to explore the world, it's nature, people, places.
 
 The pirate engineer looks like Wiley from Megaman.
 
 Pirates motivated by capital, capitalism?
 
 The Pirates are a cute family.
 
 Doing work and contributing to a community with whatever skills you have.
 
 The father pirate is good with systems, mechanical, chess, and social.
 
 Waking up from bed to another's voice.
 
 "Airships are improving, someone will find it."
 
 Robots are strange, but peaceful, like a good human society, with their own language.
 
 "You can climb trees can't you?"
 
 Army "no better than thieves".
 
 Same family, nurtured by different habitats, nature and city.
 
 Laputa died because it couldn't survive without the earth.
 
 Perhaps the most theme-rich of Miyazaki's films.
 
 Some humans strive for organization, some strive to live peacefully with disorganization. The choice depends on the nurture of people. People must be nurtured with nature for a good future.
 
 Hmm, stunning throughout. A perfect film. 4872 2015-09-28 09:25:51 2015-09-28 13:25:51 open closed laputa-castle-in-the-sky publish 0 0 post 0 Art Film Reviews Films Humanities _edit_last 1 _yoast_wpseo_content_score 60 _yoast_wpseo_primary_category Talking to Myself to Create a Statement Objective http://rahilpatel.com/blog/talking-to-myself-to-create-a-statement-objective Sat, 14 Nov 2015 23:41:35 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=4166 <a href="#talking">talking to myself</a>

 Hrmm...
 
 To make MIT's environment more playful, encouraging interaction to all departments. To move MIT's physical entity to the city?
 
 Well, that's probably what will go through my mind once I'm there.
 
 But for now, let's try to figure out some objectives here.
 
 Wait, let me peer into a <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/a-personal-statement-for-design-and-technology">past application</a> for a moment...
 
 Hmm, looks like public and games. I'm guessing I was at a downtime then, in my parent's bedroom in India, and wrote it, thinking fondly of my more game and new media oriented New York former self, and thinking less about the world around me at the time. Perhaps, wanting to escape to my childhood, playful, with less focus on society, and its infinite responsibilities.
 
 But now my objectives are less game-oriented. <strong>Though <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/a-design-strategy-for-data">using sensors and materials for design</a> </strong>is still awesome<strong>, but civics seems to be where it's at. It's about developing communities. Public spaces, public policies, shifting people to make better decisions, sharing, walking, experiencing people and nature, creating a livable environment for all. Creating a better city. And I thought I could facilitate that by <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/decision-making-civics-and-technology">designing things for the city</a>, to encourage interaction to further develop communities, to make better decisions, to make a positive impact.</strong>
 
 Another objective, created during my downtime in isolation, as opposed to the uptime I'm engaged in a social networks of a city, I also felt <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/tools-for-autodidacts">tools for knowledge and organization</a> could be useful. But in this case, I was influenced by the need of money, hoping to get an iOS gig to pay off debt quickly, and not hate myself while doing it. Most of these ideas should be left to people in San Francisco trying to create morally good tools under the influence of high land value rent slavery. How the fuck can people mold silicon atoms to transfer information, but not think about why they pay so much to be in the place they are? Hmmm...back to this... Though the tools for knowledge are useful in self-education, it's the tools for organization of peoples that's more needed.
 
 Yes. Urban Planning at the Media Lab. Paradoxical? Media doesn't affect people as real experiences do. One doesn't understand another's life by experiencing the media of another. One understands only by being in their position, at that space and time, which is, impossible.
 
 ...Sidetrained. List three faculty / research groups.
 Two I know from past Google'ing:
 1. Civic Media (current interest)
 - maybe the dude who's making Action Path
 2. Responsive Environments (was divided from Tangible Objects?, a past interest)
 - maybe the dude who made ma-key ma-key [now under Lifelong Kindergaten]
 
 [These three go together. 1 for civics, 2 for applying tech to civics in the physical environment.
 
 Maybe 3 should be living mobile for a continuation of being civic while being outside]
 
 For the third, I have to look at the list. I probably shouldn't look as it may distract me from what <em>I</em> want. But eh, I couldn't resist... It seems there's a huge overlap between my current interest of community-building / town planning (the term urban development sounds city-exclusive): Changing Places, Civic Media, and Social Computing. There's also a lot of overlap for my interest in games and new media: Tangible Objects, Playful Systems, and Lifelong Kindergarten (stemming from games for education). [In fact, the entire department could be graphed with many past thoughts and ideas.]
 
 3. have to look at the list... Hrmm..
 - Changing Places, and its projects fails to recognize that people will create places to work for themselves. For myself, I enjoy working outside. That already defeats many of it's projects. It also seems to fail take into consideration people of low income, the advent of public wifi (hopefully Boston has? lol.), and just generally the bare minimum a human needs to live and work. It shouldn't be about creating places. It's about modifying what exists to make it livable. A portable enclosed space, air conditioner, and battery seems enough. Then it becomes a social issue, of how the space affects the people nearby.
 - Human Dynamics. Though I'm interested in mapping cities, I'm not so interested I seem to have an instinctual dislike of gathering human data and using it. I prefer the complexity of infinite data coming and and going out. Perhaps this data could be used to design better cities, but that that takes the fun out of organizing the mess. Again, this seems to be too cold, like economics.
 - ...!
 
 Ah! That reminds me. I have a personal statement on my website! Perfect. Well, there's no groups for empowerment (rescuing people from slavery -- whichever slavery that may be), and the experience of being in such an environment will make it difficult for me to think about these issues, but I would have to think of my past, my past experiences, and constantly watch video of the rest of the world, then create designs on what I feel would work in any place in the world.
 
 My first objective mentions creativity from materials (material science?). This I agree. It's the basis of new media, the fun of my past time in New York with interactive art and all. But most importantly, it's about having the knowledge of existing materials, and then letting the mind create forms out of that, to affect people, socially, interactively. The problem with most of the groups is that it is all data driven. Not physical. Where's the fun in that? Therefore, one of the material-heavy research groups is necessary, <strong>just for the sake of having materials in working memory</strong>, and hopefully come in use in creative times. And in this case, it seems Responsive environments is similar to Parson's Design and Technology, in that it uses sensors and public space. That's perfect, because I don't have the knowledge for Tangible Objects. But shouldn't I try?
 
 My second objective is community development, city development, and, in the context of Taiwan, national development. Which is Civic Media.
 
 Hmmm...sidetraining to more groups:
 Macro Connections - mentions a previous thought: <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/all-products-should-have-a-face">all products should have a face</a>. Which is absolutely important in decision-making in a globalized industrial age. Especially in wasteful post-modern societies. I am spoiled with Taiwan's resourcefulness. Nothing goes to waste here, well, nothing materially, of human effort, a lot. Though the statement, transforming data into knowledge is great, the projects seem very data-driven.
 
 ...More wandering about their projects... It seems maybe one project from each group is of interest. Such as Spotz from Living Mobile or You are Here! from Social Computing. I guess I shouldn't look at the projects, and stick to their group's statement. And for that, Scalable Cooperation seems nice, though, I'm not interested in Kickstarter and the like. Rather, just Action Path. But that's a part of Civic Media.
 
 Playable Systems is something done on the side for fun. So is Design Fiction. Both seem to fall under art, not research. Save that for free time.
 
 Which leaves two, maybe, I've got quite lost in all this junk: Living Mobile and Lifelong Kindergarten. Living mobile for my nomadic life and of course to educate people while they work (or vice versa, or simultaneously), and, Lifelong Kindergarten.
 
 Hmmm yeah, forget it all and stick to my statement.
 
 8/26/15:
 
 Re-read these thoughts and put them inside [square brackets].
 
 ideal objectives:
 I want to continue living in Taiwan, manage a public space in a city, collaborate with organizations here, be a part of my neighborhood, city, and country; I want to be a part of the civic decisions that goes on it, make it better by giving people methods to make civic decisions and methods to take action beyond the recent social media leveraged protests, organize reality to help decision-making; help communities maintain themselves by being aware of local problems, encourage people to socialize and collaborate with neighbors, encourage sharing; further autonomy with self-service housing, workspaces, and work; etc. all those ideals.
 
 development of tools as the method toward ideal objectives:
 To complete these objectives: there should be tools to help organize people physically and stay up to date with those people digitally, to allow people make civic decisions and take action, to allow people to educate themselves under the circumstances of the current lifestyle,tools to teach community leaders how to organize, to enable community leaders to organize urban data, to match the right solver to the problem; There should be a better designed city to calm people from moving and find people nearby to work with. Simple ideas should exist to facilitate sharing. There should be tools to have local discussion, to corrode corruption; Thanks to Taiwan's solidarity, the autonomy of the country can be furthered with successful examples of the uses of spaces -- housing, education, work, play, and mixes; etc. all those ideal, tools.
 
 a note:
 I am mostly thinking of Taiwan here because I cannot think of the scale of America -- in size, development, and wealth. I am ignoring these things in the hope that tools will increase self-learning within self-interest, and when within a community, of the interest of others, as it worked for me.
 
 two paths:
 Continue living and working toward these ideals in Taiwan, starting with a space, as I normally do, but with the guidance of MIT Media Lab. This is less directional, but is constantly executed in reality and more pragmatic (bottom-up, agile, etc.).
 
 If it is impossible to attend MIT Media Lab remotely, then, because of the physical restriction, my objectives will be far more tool development oriented, more exclusive, and far more influenced by the people, work, and materials in the space. This is further from reality, and I will have to simulate my past social construction of the world to think about what tools would be needed.
 
 For community-based civics, the first path is better. For exposure to materials, ideas, and people, the second.
 
 objectives:
 I'm going to assume only the second path is possible due to policy limits of the institution and simulate a civic-oriented public space to think of a few projects:
 
 1. I want to create a tool to allow people (likely advanced urban peoples) to be able to create geopoints of interests to begin a forum for discussion, replacing the neighborhood town hall meeting with constant discussion (note: it would be up to the privileged smartphone-carrying generation to then communicate with non-tech people). A Civic Media project, Action Path, seemed close on paper, but far in presentation.
 
 1. Further tools to enable people to take civil actions where it is beyond their own control. Enable people to be able to directly give real and current information to the right organization i.e. sending a picture. Facilitate the process of grant writing. Micro-grant writing and giving? How do civic-oriented people make money?
 
 2. Use simple ideas, sensors, and simple DIY objects in the city to enhance community life, further civic decision-making, and incite action. How does the physical and digital match? DIY polling machines? How can I hire someone near me for a task, gig, or job? How can someone leave a task in a physical space (Taiwan loves physical signs, and I do too)? Spread the idea of sharing material within a community (starts with signs), and create tools for it.
 *. How to enable people to transform local areas into an Exploratorium filled with current knowledge, yet avoid over-development or tourism.
 
 2. Give community leaders tools to create maps from data, scrape data, and create data, though, it's possible that the existing tools are enough.
 
 3. Be in conversation with the crowdsourcing people. The digital distribution of wealth is not in my domain until it affects a physical location, to which there should be consent of the local people. Besides, it generally needs more checks.
 
 *. Improve my current self-education toolset of mobile applications. This includes reading, writing, watching, sources, curriculums, social, and experience. Think about the fastest ways to record an idea digitally and convey it. Think about how curriculums can be individually created and crowdsourced, using real local examples and digital media organized by those autodidacts. Gather the learned information [with consent] such as highlights and notes of an eBook, and video clips and its annotations, for future educational use.
 
 development of tools as the method toward objectives:
 The tools are simple. Mobile and web applications. Maybe it gets a little fancy with sensors in public places, or games. Perhaps it's the execution and spreading of ideas that is more important.
 
 priority problem of tools development:
 Being outside of the city and inside a lab, I believe it's quite difficult determine which tool is needed more, and which needs more development. When does a physical sign, a bulletin board, a mother sitting on a porch suffice, and when does it not? The priorities depend on the individual or organization. The norms of how people interact change by society and area.
 
 more public space experience as a bonus objective:
 During my life I've been lucky to stumble upon great people and great groups of people in certain spaces: a public room of my college, a progressive K-12 school in Zhongli (Taiwan), an NGO in Thailand, a cafe / performance venue in Kuala Lumpur, an outdoor restaurant in Nepal, a co-working civic space in Taizhong (Taiwan), Taipei Fablab, and countless hostels (or other shared living situations).
 
 Though they are all great, in my mind, Babycastles is the epitome of a public space. It has the civic values, diversity, technical knowledge, and energy.
 
 MIT Media seems to be the only academic department I know that comes close to my ideals and my directions (at this moment).
 
 I'm sure MIT Media Lab is similar to all those spaces I love: consensus decision-making, messy physical space, messy digital notes, impromptu city meetups, calls, messages, pictures, poor food decisions, and the sort. But I'm also sure there's lot to learn in doing it under an academic umbrella, with the rigor of the best.
 
 the takeaway / reverse brain drain:
 When the program is complete, I hope to muster all of my experience toward creating spaces around Taiwan, and perhaps later, less developed countries nearby, to help people help themselves.

 &nbsp;
 
 a comparison of my direction (statement and method) and MIT Media Lab's direction:
 My history is filled with games, media (mostly film) studies, living in cities, traveling and volunteering. In order, it was technology, media,
 
 Over my life, it seems my ideas align with MIT Media Labs, so much so that a map could be created.
 
 my ideal space and MIT Media Lab's space:
 
 These ideals seemingly fall under a categorial imperative, and to my surprise, from my experience, people in less developed societies (or ethnic enclaves of American cities) also act upon it, and I find solace within them.
 
 I believe the organization (including public spaces) must be in the city because it is impossible to understand the complexity of a city.
 
 I prefer to complete these objectives by wandering the masses of stimuli of the city, 'thinking fast' in the space and time where they are needed, creating with the efficacy of a politically influenced artist, with much awareness of the people's minds, without decor, without human language.
 
 Therefore, physically attending MIT Media Lab is paradoxical, but the execution of ideals are limited by time and the knowledge of people around me, and I again run into the familiar feeling of seeking like-minded people to be productive.
 
 If I were paid to live and do these things here, I would. I will apply to Taiwan's schools but I believe for the same reasons Parson's (The New School) design and technology (D&amp;T) program didn't work for me, neither will Taiwan's schools: their classes with real organizations encourage top-down data-driven models, their D&amp;T student body lacked diversity in income, and their space has less tools than their fine arts department, which was exclusive. I often cannot handle such difference in values.
 
 Though their government is very lenient, lawless, and giving, I still have to work with language barrier, self-finance (English tutor or whatever else capitalism values here), and a somewhat traditional government.
 
 I believe it's possible to educate within public spaces, guide people toward my interests, which are likely in the people's interest. I found the hard way, that keeping such a space or community alive is more than a full-time job, but worth pursuing.
 
 --
 
 &nbsp;
 
 &nbsp;
 
 As much as I want accomplish all those objectives, even after lengths of time of doing others kinds of work and travel, I seem to fall into a habitual trap of doing something from my past self, organizing things on a computer.
 
 It's wrong. I should be in Nepal searching villages who haven't received aid, and help organize the examination and earthquake-proofing of housing, or something else direly needed local to my current position.
 
 I want to keep my body in the developing world for everyday experiences to affect me, and to maintain a nearly-purely functional (according to my social reality at that time) lifestyle because this is an audience my mind can make sense of (in my mind).

 <span id="statement"><strong>statement objective</strong></span>:
 "Statement Objective" for MIT Media Lab:
 First, the questions, then some chit-chat.
 
 The Questions:
 Why you wish to attend graduate school:
 To experience a great space (MIT Media Lab) again and apply it’s successful methods, ethics, and rigour to the ones I desire to create in Taiwan, and wherever else I may be. It's also nice to experience all of the directions The Lab is going, so that when I am wondering about creatively and philosophically, within a social space or alone, I have some anchored directions to compare my own with.
 
 What you would like to study:
 [EDIT: My first research field interest, Civic Media group, has been removed, and many of the other group’s statements and projects have been moved around, altered, and or updated. Although unfortunate, I don’t think my statement requires much alteration. The groups that I have selected are the means to civil and social ends, of which pervade several groups within the lab.]
 
 My most desired direction of work overlaps well with the Civic Media group's statement: “…Transforming civic knowledge into civic action…” and “…experimenting with a variety of new civic media techniques, from technologies for protests and civil disobedience…”. I would like to re-experience current massively available technology (sensors, micro-controllers, etc.) and spend time playing with materials to have these things in working memory so that I (1) think of designs for civic tools. Ideally (more under Chit-Chat later) I prefer to consistently execute and innovate on direct social and urban interventions [/techniques?] to try to budge human behavior — in small steps toward collectively agreeable things like public safety, health, and sanitation — with a minimum amount of wealth. While experimenting, I would likely want to study anything related to that. The goal is to aid or enable people to make better decisions and actions and conversely to disorganize people from their habituated cultured actions to create more diverse social experiences, with the end being to improve society (non-material, culture) and urban (material),
 
 I think as a kind of nomadic autodidact, creating (2) tools to facilitate self-education whilst physically moving will always naturally come to mind, and as a kind of people organizer so too will (3) tools to facilitate social organizing. These interests are auxiliary to the more civic-action-oriented interests, but it sure would be nice to have these groups around to interact with.
 
 I think simply due to a long past of playing and even making games, I think as a counter my seriousness, (4) it would be nice to incept, design, and implement playful ideas again, even just for the sake of being actively making.
 
 What you would precisely like study (optional reading, in case the above was too general):
 The project that comes closest to my interests are the ideas (from the research paper) behind Action Path, not the actual product (from the powerpoint presentation), which seems to be far different. Here’s how I imagined it in an email to the creator of it: “I would love to subscribe to any changes in my neighborhood by the government, old-wealthy gangsters (Taiwan's old private sector), and new-wealth gentrifiers. If the information is not transparent (very likely for all of Taiwan), then people (likely advanced urban peoples) should be able to create geopoints of interests to begin a forum for discussion (and then the new tech generation will hold a physical meeting for the old people).” Or perhaps there should be a small voting device that can be physically placed at locations, for the old generation and keeping votes within proximity.
 
 Promise Tracker’s idea to "hold elected leaders accountable for political promises" is pretty good under a working representative democracy, but I feel the project's actions are too lenient to make any meaningful political change. Promise Tracker’s method of gathering real data, tracking the status, and attracting attention, however, is a good one, and could be applied to any civic problem and institution. A kind of more abstract FixMyStreet, and better suited tool than creating a Facebook group. It would be more interesting as a simple tool for smaller self-governing communities, or neighborhoods, where it feels less like blaming a representative and more of a cooperative initiative with neighbors.
 
 Perhaps my urge for more direct changes is from my experience in Taiwan, where law enforcement ideology is opposite of US: there is none. This allows people to take a lot more civil actions without worrying so much about laws and policies. Of course, this requires quite a good education and culture, but I also feel it creates a far more ideal social framework to design for.
 
 A class from MIT Urban Planning department titled behavior and policies (http://dusp.mit.edu/behavior-and-policies-2014), though heavily referencing pop science books, is perhaps to the closest to my ideal direction of negating bad behavior. Though note, that class is limited to policy-making as its means of influencing, and transportation as its sole focus. I’m not interested in policy-making, I’m interesting in culture-making.
 
 Though a part of my statement is to adopt better behaviors, especially the case in urban areas, the counterpart is to create tools to enhance simple communal life. Politically reworded: to reduce the adverse behavioral affects of capitalism and to increase the social organization of anarchic communal spaces.
 
 Instead of what I want to study, it may help to list projects that I don’t care much about: projects that display crowd-sourced data-driven data, aggregate and order media, attempt to gather even more data from humans, projects that deals private housing, and projects that solely use data as the basis for its [instrumental] rationality. This is simply because I'm always skeptical about data and it’s oft pairing of top-down methodologies, especially of how urban material affects human minds and lives.
 
 Despite my desire for reasonable behavior, I am a romantic and hope that everyone can walk and talk across the cities and countries they live in as opposed to gazing at data — People don't change their behavior because data tells them, it's because they've had certain life experiences, and then they become agents with the possibility to alter the culture people live in.
 
 Any research experience:
 Research requires too much time, so I’ve tend to skip to theory or practice and learn the hard way. This is a pretty consistent fault of my personality — think McCandless from Into the Wild —, and hence my interest in quicker solutions such as direct interventions and Banksy style art; I normally do not think systematically and I am not interested in writing about sociology into scientific journals; This may be another reason to attend a research graduate school: to experience research, especially at the top research institute. Though, I think I will always be skeptical.
 
 Describe one or more accomplishments you are particularly proud of that suggest that you will succeed in your chosen area of research:
 I'm particularly fond of my time in New York with the local game and new media scene which resulted in participating in game jams (includes Doodle Tangle prototype), making two games: Pinkies Up and Crystal Brawl, and spending time at Babycastles, an amazing public volunteer-based organization with what now seems incredible values and dreams, and set the bar for what a social organization can be and do.
 
 The hope here is that my design and tech past will converge with my more civil-oriented motivations.
 
 About the Quirkiness of my Application:
 Though my application is playfully written, I confirm it is as accurate within the limits of the application form. Of Letters of Recommendation: I won’t ask friends for letters until I enter society and begin talking again so that one has the most recent references, but if needed, I can provide previous letters of recommendation written last year for The New School / Parson’s / Design and Technology program, which are written from my game friends in New York. Of Subjects Taken: I don’t remember much of college work and therefore did not list it. Much of my education during college came from films via the advent of Netflix. Of Financial Support: I currently have no money and how much I will have will depend on the future. It’s all true, though seemingly a joke.
 
 Chit-Chat (extra reading):
 What I Want and Why I Applied:
 What I really desire is continue living in Taiwan, create a social organization here, not too far from what I feel MIT Center for Civic Media does, with less emphasis on the development of complex tools, and more on practice — using tools to create urban maps, using Action Path to geolocate discussions, using Promise Tracker to keep government in check, follow and use Taiwan’s kickstarter for civic projects, etc. — and for general community hall things for continuous local experience.
 
 The Paradox (written during a more intense time):
 I believe the organization (including public spaces) must be in the city because it is impossible to understand the complexity of a city outside of it.
 
 I prefer to complete these objectives by wandering the masses of stimuli of the city, 'thinking fast' in the space and time where they are needed, creating with the efficacy of a politically influenced artist, with much awareness of the people's minds, without decor, without human language.
 
 Therefore, physically attending MIT Media Lab is paradoxical [because it is not in Taipei, and is private], yet the execution of ideals are limited by time and the knowledge of people around me, and I again run into the familiar feeling of seeking like-minded people to be productive.
 
 Now and Next:
 I took a break from Taipei and lodged myself in a nearby small town, to which I thought and wrote a lot, beginning with this application meandering to grants applications in which my statement sounds like the creation of a kind of ‘MIT social and urban innovation lab’ and back to this.
 
 I’ve come to the conclusion that granting organizations, or anyone really, won’t fund wild individuals, so I’m just going to have to continue going around Taiwan on a scooter, hopping about social organizations, probably ending back in Taipei Fablab, which is where I will probably begin to organize again because that’s the most open organization I’ve run into here, and would help with obtaining grants.
 
 I’ll also be applying to National Taiwan University’s urban planning program (Taiwan doesn’t have anything like the Media Lab) and scholarships for it, as a strategy to stick myself in Taipei, get funding, and gather local and national organization knowledge, at the cost of time.
 
 Beyond Taiwan:
 Though Taiwan is my ideal first area for creating such public spaces for these directions, it is not the limit. I’ve lived somewhat nomadically since college graduation and I try to make a positive social impact wherever I am. The hope is that after MIT I will be more efficient at creating impacts in the right directions in any human settlement.

 I was able to deeply relate with Wittgenstein, often arguing against Ray Monk’s excellent take, especially of the portion of time he spent in towns and villages in cold places, teaching, not wanting to teach, constantly philosophizing, constantly trying to maximize time, constantly thinking, constantly exploring, suffering from the need of a social life and the failure to have a consistent one.
 
 At the time, I found Russell extremely cold, narrow in view, not including is equally narrow analytic philosophy and morals. Though somewhat interesting due to early philosophy and later political interests, the most interest part was his contact with Wittgenstein, to further understand to Wittgenstein from another mind.
 
 Overall, though I enjoyed Russell’s political campaign during the Cold War, and his trip in China, I otherwise disagreed with his lifestyle as an ideal to achieve, instead, keeping Wittgenstein as a pretty good philosopher model. Wittgenstein’s mind was separated form body. It enabled him to think about anything during any time. Experiencing and thinking. Often trying combine them, but failing. Going to University, just to leave in disappointment. Steeped in reality, of war and developing societies.
 
 Recently I read a bit of a biography of Paul Erdos (Erdős), The Man Who Only Loved Numbers. There was a review on the front flap:
 <blockquote>To find another life this century as intensely devoted to abstraction, one must reach back to Ludwig Wittgenstein (1889-1951), who stripped his life bare for philosophy. But whereas Wittgenstein discarded his family fortune as a form of self-torture, Mr. Erdos gave away most of the money he earned because he simply did not need it... And where Wittgenstein was driven by near suicidal compulsions, Mr. Erdos simply constructed his life to extract the maximum amount of happiness.
 </blockquote>
 Though I believe Wittgenstein’s life and insight is far more broader and valuable, Erdos’s lifestyle serves as a pretty good alternative model. He uses math as a constant anchor, a creative endeavor, a medium. With math, he maintained math friends. With philosophy, Wittgenstein deterred intellectual relationships, even other philosophers. Both were successful, but Erdos was far more consistent. 
 
 Like Wittgenstein, Erdos seemed to also live nomadically. Erdos seemed to be more of a couch-surfer of friends and institutions, whereas Wittgenstein had no social connections, or often cut them off. Math is considered a formal science and therefore is appreciated by society. Philosophy is not, especially not any novel form of it. The difference is skepticism, and that difference, makes one’s life very difficult. Russell was one of the few trying to hold him as a social contact, but the relationship worked best through letters, not in the same institution.
 
 Like Witggenstien, Erdos also separated mind and body. Math is perhaps even more theoretical than some philosophy, which may have increased the separation. Erdos lived quite unhealthily, drinking caffeine and taking meta-amphetamines, eating cold cereals. He didn’t spend time on material. It’s a waste of time. I believe Wittgenstein also spent little time on material, and more time walking, thinking, and for a few moments, teaching.
 
 Though Erdos was usually deep in math, he seemed to be well experienced, understanding much of society and politics too, highly likely because of his nomadic life. It’s a good balance, doing work with friends and traveling between friend’s places. It resulted in the most amount of math papers, and, probably affected just as many non-math people in his life.
 
 Upon reading that front flap, I thought, perhaps, I also need an anchor, a medium. Games was a past anchor, then perhaps it was new media, but during travel it was lost in the chaos, then found again with language (philosophy). The mind needs some kind of anchor to organize the material to be creative. Recently, I’ve seen some good film essays by Chris Marker and Jia Zhangke. Video can be a good anchor. It doesn’t have to be a medium. It could be any subject. Perhaps in the process of living and trying to philosophizing everything in generality, I failed because I wasn’t specific?
 
 No. Cities, urban planning, human geography, marxism, social change are all good directions. I think I just want something to fall back to. Something that society also strives for. Perhaps I’m being a coward at the moment, not embracing chaos. But to tame chaos, isn’t some kind of medium needed? Or should one skip medium and directly affect it? Are the particular direct affects not greater than the general? What’s more important: math or affecting individuals? Creating new mediums and broad film essays or helping neighbors?
 
 Perhaps I failed to find a way to match my past creative endeavors (art mediums) with my later socio-political endeavors. Perhaps my values shifted from depicting realism in art mediums to pragmatically affecting reality. Or, perhaps I failed because I failed to find people with similarly broad interests.
 
 Wittgenstein constantly strived to be creative and explore philosophy, and at times of teaching, do it socially. He often failed during the social times, or, they were short-lived.
 
 Erdos kept his endeavors separate. One part math, one part nomadic and sociopolitical. His math endeavors were social too, which made it easy to stay somewhat stable.
 
 Most recently, I saw a documentary on Julian Assange, another nomad. He was able to successfully use his early creative endeavors, hacking, as a means to his later socio-political motivations. <strong>Perhaps using creative endeavors as a means for sociopolitical changes is indeed the best path.</strong> Use new media as a means to an political ideal end, with a dash of aesthetics. The direction is always a better society. The solutions are multiple, allowing one to be creative.
 
 Another problem is of simultaneously being part of a society whilst creating something about the society one lives in, or, of another, or of several. How does one have a social life while living nomadically. All three philosophers lived an irregular social life. Wittgenstein and Julian had few social connections at any given time in life. Erdos had a better normative social model, by calling mathematicians at random times of the day. Though eccentric, he was able to maintain a social life, avoid hermitude. Assange’s ability seems to be greater: he seems to be able to create a social organization wherever he goes, gathering people (or “volunteers”) to take action at any moment. Wittgenstein failed to do this [because his peers were in higher institutions], and Erdos didn't need to do this because his interests were limited to math. Again, Assange serves as a better role model because his <strong>ability of making his creative and sociopolitical endeavors social</strong>.
 
 It’s the innate sociopolitical desire for positive change that allowed Julian to always be able to do things with people. When one is doing something that the entirety of society (save greedy people) agrees with, life is indeed easier, and better. Math is socially limited to other mathematicians, some parts of philosophy is limited to other philosophers, but sociopoltical progress is something everyone is willing to pitch in to.
 
 <strong>Sociopolitical progress is the ideal anchor. As long as sociopolitical progress is the [end] goal of an individual’s actions is directed toward, the individual will always have someone to talk to. The methods, mediums or direct action, do not matter, as long as one communicates the end goal</strong>.

 10/17/15:
 After watching N Is a Number: A Portrait of Paul Erdős, of which much is repeated in the pop biography The Man Who Only Loved Numbers, some more thought occurred.
 
 Erdos was described to be able to <strong>remember the current progress all of his social experiences associated with mathematics, and in this way, he was able to use a social network of mathematicians (via telephone, e-mail, and meetups), maximizing progress by allocating problems to each mathematician's forte</strong>; Or asking the right people the right questions (problems). He was the nexus of mathematics, overseeing the progress of the a great portion of the field, excavating knowledge from "The Book" from all directions. He didn't spend much time on creating theories or frameworks, instead, he opted to continue asking questions, like a Socrates of mathematics, but to do this one must have quite a good framework already in the mind. In this way, he could <strong>focus time on exploration [of math], as opposed to organization [of math]; He only organized people for the sake of mathematic exploration, which probably has a greater chance of progress than organizing knowledge into theorems</strong>.
 
 Upon being kicked out of the United States, he "chose freedom". He then chose <strong>freedom from institutions. This allowed him to collaborate with anyone at anytime</strong> -- any of his time at least, and his collaborators probably usually wanted to work together. The clear fault here are institutions, which limits broader social collaboration, and probably more so during his time, institutions were quite specialized.
 
 Using Erdos's methods, I wonder of the results of it's application to sociopolitical organizing. When one is socially connected to many sociopolitical organizations and people, one can contact any one of these people at anytime, maximizing social progress by allocating the the right problems to the right people.
 
 Hmm, no, it's not quite the same. It works for math because math is already such a specialized field of knowledge. In the case of social, political, and environmental progress, though there are individuals with more experience, the interest exist within many of the people that make up a community. Only allotting problems to pre-existing organizations leads to bureaucracy. The problems should be allocated to anyone who volunteers in the effort. <strong><a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/decision-making-civics-and-technology">The most an individual can do is increase the efficiency of civic progress by providing tools and methods</a>, or use the methods of social movements and lead them, or be a saint via consistent direct action</strong>.

 Thoughts during a viewing of Winter’s Bone:
 
 Their school is not much different from my own: army training classes (ROTC, whatever that acronym was for), teaching young female students how to carry a child, general guidance in life. I didn’t touch any of that.
 
 The mother has to take care of kids, a dog, and a horse. She must wash clothes, cut wood, comb her mother’s hair (optional). This is life without technology. Not enough free time or simultaneous time to consume media.
 
 Law as major problem. How can the law allow the father to put the house on bail. Does the police not care for people?
 
 ~”Never ask to what ought to be offered.” This is a moral the mother teaches to her son, even in the face of hunger. I don’t believe it. Technology should be shared, along with food and housing.
 Temporarily gave horse to neighbor for care because low on money. Neighbor offers to take care and allows to use technology to chop wood more efficiently. Food is low too. Difficult to survive.
 Must teach kids how to survive. This community is barely surviving, in the most developed nation. These kinds of places actually exist in Suffolk, Virginia.
 
 Asks to come in to friend’s house.
 
 Actually, that was normal in College Park too. Though, on film, it seems so unnatural, unsocial.
 
 Even the mother must ask her husband to use “his” truck, to help her friend by giving a ride. Hmm, maybe she asks to come in because the father owns the house. Well, the father’s parents gave it to them. So much property non-sharing already.
 
 It really is the survival of the fittest, as opposed to communism.
 Mmm indeed gender difference in marriage.
 
 Uncle has a gun. Went to army? Treats humans like animals without feelings.
 
 Can’t escape to city? This community is barely surviving. No media about cities? Or any better place for living?
 
 Men settle “business” while women stay at home. Feels like such an ancient society, like that Kurosawa film Dodeskaden, yet it exists.
 
 Blood. The big man.
 
 Skinning and gutting a squirrel is indeed weird to a new person, unnatural.
 
 Gossip as belief of who has power? Or gossip as fear from law?
 —
 
 I stopped writing perhaps before buildup of climax. Not so much because it was somewhat socially realistic and thrilling, but because it contained many elements of a thriller narrative and tropes, such as a good uncle that acts bad uncle (think Professor Snape), a badass gang with a gang leader, and so on. Yet it somehow mixed in quite an unfamiliar setting in the Ozarks of the U.S, making it feel quite real. I guess I’m not ready for narratives, and rather stick to film essays.

 <h2>9/20/2016 and the few days before</h2>
 
 I've watched the ending of the film a few times recently:
 Such a great end to the film. I can't think of other animated films that can match.
 
 <blockquote>Just shake hands?</blockquote>
 
 Taeko imagines a life as a farmer, with Toshio. The idea is there. The <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/a-japanese-ideal">ideal</a> is there. Then next day, she acts upon it.
 
 When one leaves a place, a person, a society, that one loves, the reaction is that of Taeko sticking outside the train window, looking back: a mildly surprised blank expression — What now? It happens every time for me too, an awkward good-bye, then thinking while leaving. Or, a lack of thinking, emptiness. I usually take a nap being tired of packing and good-byes, and only begin thinking and living the day I arrive at the destination. Taeko, instead, stays up, with a blank expression, thinking, as the wonderful scenery passes: what now?
 
 Go back to a simple office job? That seems crazy from this place, this moment. No, it’s natural to stay with Toshio’s family. So, why am I on a train? Where am I going? There’s no need to go.
 
 That, compounded with the fact she felt love for the first time, makes the decision easy.
 
 The younger Taeko tugs at her older self’s arm — C’mon! And from a blank expression to realization, she decides, and acts upon the decision.
 
 And that’s another example of <strong>socialization in a Takahata film</strong>.
 
 <h2>9/9/2016 daytime</h2>
 [todo: review thoughts]
 
 <blockquote>”Thanks to you, I finally have family in the countryside"</blockquote>
 
 Oh such memories of people I’ve met or lived with in the countryside. The hostels and countryside houses make me so happy. Such a good life. Such sweet, good-hearted people.
 
 ”As the memories came flooding back."
 --
 
 The family gets together to eat a pineapple. So much sharing and conserving of food. Wasting food goes against culture in a huge way, perhaps due to war and history. Though now, with the industrial revolution, it’s strange to see. And it still exists. It’s irrational now, yet the culture still exists.
 
 The sisters think of eating banana and eat it, as opposed to seeing something, then eating it. It’s very rational-choice, as opposed to Taiwan’s night market, strolling and eating anything seen. It’s far less adventurous.
 
 The girl’s memories of hot springs, pineapple, rock’n’roll craze, and school build up so much, so much reality.
 
 Japan’s school culture is nuts with self-governing hall monitors making decisions. So many rules. So Japan-esquire.
 
 :D The love sequence is brilliant. First love, so well portrayed. Awkward, but lovely. And it’s the female side that shows.
 
 Why 5th grade? A certain time is remembered.
 
 lololol, so fun from a girl’s perspective. Buying underpants in the infirmary.
 
 The facial expressions are great too.
 
 Hmmm, this is useless! Becoming a review, as opposed to a way to think about my next move. Argh.
 
 Chrysalis stage? I don’t remember this scene.
 
 But when one stops working, the mind wanders, dreams, desires, an ideal life?
 
 <strong>Flexing female strength (ability, mind) then giving in to culture.</strong>
 
 Memory and then sleep. Yep. That’s actually how it works. The mind wanders then contemplates.
 --
 
 Continued from the next day:
 Mmm, thinking of stealing a bag is a cultural problem from the city. The interaction between city and rural changes, to being more physical, without worry. Like Jon said, in India a stranger grabbed a kid’s arm to get him on the train, without asking. It’s normal, in the culture of that place.
 
 Toshio likes his car. Rural people like their materials. As do I. It’s a possessive thing, habituation. And music. Zombie-like rural life. Less thinking, routine action.
 
 Toshio likes Hungarian music, because it’s farmer music, and he’s a farmer. I’ve met aboriginals that listen to other aboriginal music before too. Aboriginals find other aboriginals relatable, and even interesting.
 
 Toshio and his friends came to see a girl from Tokyo. Out of interest, people from small, homogenous societies often do find foreigners interesting.
 
 Toshio, almost gets into an accident, as either he’s habituated to rural driving, or just is more in tune to driving and not worrying about safety, especially compared to Japanese city folk.
 
 I think he even curses like a local.
 
 A famous Basho poem is recited. Neat that he reads it, also is relatable to his life.
 
 She reads it as more of research and a bit of curiosity.
 
 He says that the farmers didn’t make money from safflower. And also in the past, they didn’t make money from some red flower (crimson, rogue). It’s a reality of capitalism. The merchants made the money, as they do now in India and probably everywhere.
 
 Barbecue on the mountain. I recently had a barbecue under a bridge in Lanyu.
 
 <blockquote>"Fewer people live for their work"
 
 ”I don’t live for my job, but I don’t hate it either"
 
 ”I could farm for 24 hours a day"</blockquote>
 
 His ethics are unbelievably good-hearted.
 
 Ah, he also moved from office job to farming. Neat! Hence his enthusiasm.
 
 The scene showing the individual farmers is great. A reality check.
 
 Haha, rural people always care for health, tired? Hungry? It’s their way of caring.
 
 Mmm, old tales, of history.
 
 Mmmmm, at first she thinks of resentment of city people, capitalists.
 
 The grandmother prays toward the rising sun. Takeover watches the people, happily, and then copies, prays.
 
 Pictures are taken, like a good trip.
 
 She talks of history, and industrial revolution, but as I thought of while watching, some work still requires human hands, like picking tea leaves.
 
 Rain doesn’t stop people from working, even if the work is done outside. Just have to do it.
 
 As a smarter city person, she thinks of history of the society.
 
 <blockquote>“If I could’ve worked like this as a child, my school essays would’ve been really interesting”</blockquote>
 
 Need experience to write.
 
 Haha cute, still picky about onions. I was a bit picky too. :)
 
 The third child is always a bit more spoiled, somehow.
 
 Mmm, grandmother says the three daughters are so selfish.
 
 Haha father loves her, and sticks to her side. :)
 
 Hehe, grandmother doesn’t eat oily food.
 
 Hahahaha the purse scene is great.
 
 Ahhhh what a crazy culture, slap for no shoes. Memories.
 
 Haha, thinking she was adopted. Normal to think that in single culture.
 
 Mmmm, a single slap. I remember that too.
 
 Haha spoiled brat. I was too. :)
 
 Not sure why there was a creationist scene during the promise.
 
 Haha touristy area because of good views. Truth.
 
 Mmm, remembers disappointing parents. Mmm, not normal. Ah, gets the big picture in dividing fractions, as opposed to route learning.
 
 Good move by Toshio, paralleling the math problem. “We farmers give up too easily.” Giving in to culture, following normative development (against capitalism [“let’s rethink prosperity”, or whatever a city represents), just like her education norm.
 
 As they walk and talk, tourism exists in the background.
 
 <blockquote>“I could never give up to it completely.”</blockquote>
 That is exactly how I feel.
 
 Haha ski instructor, kind of like how I want to be a diving instructor in Lanyu. Physical prowess of rural people.
 
 <strong>The history of an area</strong> is almost philosophical! Haven’t seen that in an anime before, or any film. Love it. Observant.
 
 <blockquote>“That’s why I felt so at home. Although I didn’t grow up here, my soul was at home here. So that’s it.”</blockquote>
 
 <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/a-japanese-ideal">Takahata romanticized nature, farmer life.</a> Depicts it real, as a struggle, with history, but the main character also has this romantic view.
 
 Toshio says in theory it’s good, but in reality it’s hard work. It’s repeated, but worth repeating, as it does seem great as an idea, but very few go back.
 - <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/creativity-what-society-needs-and-what-society-wants">It's a choice in lifestyle</a>, to live as a farmer. Under global capitalism it doesn't make much money, as mentioned many times. Is it even considered progress for humankind? Why not eat industrially-created dry foods and use industrially-create artificial dye, as opposed to using one's own body to struggle to inefficiently extract commodities from nature? The two jobs result in a vastly different experience, and as always, it's the experience that matters. Driving through those fields, thinking of the history of the area, thinking broadly of lifestyles (/ all the ways people live in all societies) in all points in history. Sure, it's more materially efficient for Taeko to be a an office bee in a company's hive, but there, she won't have experiences that deviate from other city bees. There, she can only experience through media, such as Basho, or virtual reality. The current iteration of the modern city becomes habituated as the reality of the world for many people in the world, but what about all of other possible ways to live? What could those experiences lead to?
 
 She tries country life. A guy helped her live it.
 
 Haha essays and creativity through a rehearsed play. She realized she could do anything. That’s creativity. :) I think some of these dreams may be from Takahata’s past too, as he’s quite studious too.

 The problem with narratives is that they show life, instead of showing a method to improve society. Narratives will only deeply affect those who have experienced similar times as the characters have, which is often limited to the society the characters live in.
 
 For example, here, I am reminded of farmers in Taiwan, Taiwan's rural areas such as Yilan county which I am currently residing in and the east coast, which I have travelled recently.
 
 Other than that, nothing to the film applies to my life, and is therefore impractical to me.
 
 General themes exist. The special ones here are the fakeness of short-term tourism, the difficulty of socialization, and a female's perspective in contemporary society.
 
 But as usual, narratives are just consumables, not reality, nothing to react to. Quite different from a practical handbook, a workshop, or a social experience. 4914 2015-10-10 15:43:50 2015-10-10 19:43:50 open closed only-yesterday publish 0 0 post 0 Art Film Reviews Films Humanities _edit_last 1 _yoast_wpseo_content_score 30 _yoast_wpseo_primary_category medium_post O:11:"Medium_Post":11:{s:16:"author_image_url";s:74:"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/200/200/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png";s:10:"author_url";s:28:"https://medium.com/@rahil627";s:11:"byline_name";N;s:12:"byline_email";N;s:10:"cross_link";s:2:"no";s:2:"id";s:12:"8bb98a9bf50f";s:21:"follower_notification";s:3:"yes";s:7:"license";s:19:"all-rights-reserved";s:14:"publication_id";s:12:"7a04709b0155";s:6:"status";s:6:"public";s:3:"url";s:56:"https://medium.com/@rahil627/only-yesterday-8bb98a9bf50f";} Into the Wild http://rahilpatel.com/blog/into-the-wild Wed, 04 Nov 2015 18:52:55 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=4982 [todo: just copied from from text file.

 I've written quite a bit recently about searching for an <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/anchors-famous-nomads-and-the-ideal-nomadic-lifestyle">the ideal nomadic lifestyle, using the lives of successful like-minded people</a>. This book and film, though both lacking intellectual rigor to understand the protagonist's thoughts, have an ideal nomad as the subject, making it frighteningly good material for self-reflection.
 
 <h2>Into the Wild [film] (second viewing in lifetime):</h2>
 Why Alaska? Maybe he just happened to be there after a long trip, constantly escaping society.
 
 Perhaps the bus was his death. The lure of a shelter, a home, to organize things and life in, as opposed to the constant decision-making the road offers. Perhaps he would have kept going, in and out of society. But the shelter kept him in place. Perhaps. Well, maybe not. He probably would have continued if he were in good health. Just a matter of lack of nearby health facility.
 
 "The climactic battle of killing the false being within"
 - what's the false being here, the culture of society.
 
 He doesn't want "things".
 
 "Chris measured himself and others around him with a fiercely moral code".
 
 "He risked what could have been a relentlessly lonely path, but found company in the characters of the books he loved...Tolstoy, London, Thoreau...He could summon their words to suit any occasion"
 
 "It was inevitable that Chris would break away, and when he would do it, he would do it with characteristic immoderation"
 
 Immediately after college, he leaves the ?...
 
 Uses car as transport and shelter. Somehow missed flash flood warning. It happens, can't plan everything.
 
 A documentary proved that in his bag upon death he still had all of his IDs and $300 cash, so he didn't cut and burn them. It makes no sense to. Have to watch out for fiction.
 
 He leaves his car, just keep moving forward. No point of using time to salvage. Keep creating. Less things.
 
 His tent, still too close to society, as vacationers watersurf nearby. Have to move further, at least away from tourism.
 
 He cleans himself in an outdoor bathroom.
 
 He had good grades in serious subjects, contemporary politics in Africa, Apartheid, food crisis in Africa, etc.
 
 "...Spent four years fulfilling the absurd and tedious duty of graduating college...emancipated from false sense of security, parents, and material excess, things that cut Chris off from the truth of his existance"
 
 Pacific Crest Trail
 
 Bought books on edible plants. Now that's hardcore.
 
 "Rather than love, than money, than faith, than fame, give me truth." Paraphrase of Thoreau against the lovely hippie mother who asks to love his parents.
 
 He stays up focused, reading.
 
 Meaningless battles at home, between parents, and some between children and parent.
 
 He moves quick and enthusiastic, like a monkey. :)
 
 Afraid of water.
 
 Reads in solitude, no love, ascetic, but loves humans.
 
 Camps in a hill, not too far from a hitchhikeable road.
 
 Lol, shaving in large farm sprinklers. Yessss.
 
 Doesn't gamble. Enjoys company, though with a barrier, not giving into culture completely.
 
 Plays music whilst everyone else gets drunk and talks.
 
 Listens to many stories, but doesn't talk back much, except for his dislike of society.
 
 Vince Vaughn rightly says to go South, and only Alaska during Spring.
 - Why north? Because that's where no one has travelled before? There are many unexplored areas in America, especially in cold mountains. No need to go to Alaska to get away.
 
 Vince getting arrested is the causation of continuing to travel.
 
 After high school he drove cross country in a used Datson.
 
 Lol at permit to paddle on river. Reminds me of when I wanted to dive (with a group) on the east coast of Taiwan, and snorkel some part of Okinawa.
 
 Water is indeed frightening.
 
 Ah shit, didn't take helmet. So focused on moving forward, sometimes take more risky paths. It's inevitable. I've made some rash decisions too, like taking buses at night, or not wearing a helmet while biking.
 
 Mmm, at age 4 at 3am wondered 6 blocks for some candy. Oh the sweet adventure.
 
 Freedom and simple beauty.
 
 36 days in a cave. Crossed border without care.
 - Mmmm, 36 days. The time goes by in a cut of a film, but that's 36 days of exploring nearby and thinking. The bus only lasted 100 days, so it's not much different, yet it's disproportionately cut off like much of the film.
 
 Fit with exercise and shadowboxing.
 
 The city is indeed haunting. Reminds me of my time in New York. I had a lot of rapid thoughts. The problem with film is one doesn't know what the person is thinking. There could be a lot of complex thoughts going on at any moment in McCandless's head, but no way to communicate it, not even in writing. What he thinks here is forgotton.
 
 Eat and sleeps at homeless shelter. Quite a different experience than nature. This is indeed what one must resort to in the city.
 
 He's ashamed to ask for a bed at a homeless shelter.
 
 The dark and trashy inner city. Why would anyone choose not to be a part of culture and live in the city, as opposed to not be a part of culture and live in nature? It's the society vs not theme. Trying to be a part of society but consistently failing to be, leading to ascetism. Perhaps my ideals where too far from society, that when I tried to implement it in Taipei, I failed, instead, appeared homeless. I tried to be a part of society on my ideal terms, but it doesn't work, and so I had to get out.
 
 McCandless looks at a mid to upper class restaurant similar to the way I did in New York and Taipei. I didn't want any part of these places.
 
 But unlike me, he leaves the same night. I camped a few nights by the river. Then had a friend house me for a week. Then a cheap hostel. But I was running out of options, money, and the city wasn't offering me any outs, as much as I tried, communicated.
 
 The city scenes are at night, nature scenes in day, which corresponds to the times people are active in each area.
 
 The culture is so restricting that he probably didn't find anyone nice, human in the city. Later, he gets kicked off a railroad for freeloading, as if he made a difference. The strictness of civilization, must have made him want to retreat further from it. At many times I feel society is so beauracratic, so stupid, that I also get away from it.
 
 Lol, works at fast food restaurant for money to get to Alaska. I need to do this right now! Fuck being trapped at this hostel. I can work temporarily and move on.

 <h2>Thoughts the day after viewing (11/2):</h2>
 [from the next day on a bus to Taipei?]
 I felt I should go immediately. I can work a temporary job for a little cash. Then if I want, I can go back to Taipei and continue my plan. It's okay to not begin my plan immediately. It's great enough that I still desire to do so. It's better than being at the wrong institution, country, or social group. At least I can still think about it. It's my grand Alaskan plan.
 
 I can re-learn to eat oatmeal and exercise. I can work and read books. But perhaps I've already spent enough time doing these things and desire to be in the direction of my plan, with people. It's okay. Saving money is a necessary part of it. Or, taking a loan. Whichever. But a loan is cheating. Without the loan I am more free, likely to take on whatever paid gig. The loan requires a plan.
 
 From a bus, I can see the mountains and the towns next to them. Do I want to be there farming? As long as I meet some nice people to talk to.
 
 Or should I go back to my creative self, putting material and idea together for civics or education? That's where all my active thoughts go toward. Farming will just create slave mentality, no inspiration, like a suburban house.
 
 Maybe it's the active survival that will wake me up, or at least keep me awake. And that will cause me to act, instinctively to survive. Similarly, isn't it instinct to protect others, people? That's worth being active for too. Civics.
 
 <strong>Nature provokes thought, for survival. Cities provoke thought, for the betterment of society. Nature teaches one to be self-reliant. Cities allow one to maximize their potential. Nature is indeed backwards.</strong>
 
 <strong>Use nature as a means for taking a break, not an end. The end is the city. One must alternate between both. Or, keep drifting between small towns and organizations.</strong>

 <h2>notes for Into The Wild book:</h2>
 [over two days]
 “The repugnance to animal food is not the effect of experience, but is an instinct. It appeared more beautiful to live low and fare hard in many respects; and though I never did so, I went far enough to please my imagination. I believe that every man who has ever been earnest to preserve his higher or poetic faculties in the best condition has been particularly inclined to abstain from animal food, and from much food of any kind….
 It is hard to provide and cook so simple and clean a diet as will not offend the imagination; but this, I think, is to be fed when we feed the body; they should both sit down at the same table. Yet perhaps this may be done. The fruits eaten temperately need not make us ashamed of our appetites, nor interrupt the worthiest pursuits. But put an extra condiment into your dish, and it will poison you.
 “YES,” wrote McCandless and, two pages later, “Consciousness of food. Eat and cook with concentration…. Holy Food.” On the back pages of the book that served as his journal, he declared:
 I am reborn. This is my dawn. Real life has just begun[…]”
 - here, McCandless finally becomes conscious of everyday life-sustaining activities, of food, work, task, reading. His awareness changed toward his actions. He became aware of more. He created a philosophical base.
 
 “I was under way, propelled by an imperative that was beyond my ability to control or comprehend.”
 - monomania is a good word for this too. I surely suffered from this too, with San Francisco, New York, and later travels, but that’s how travel works, you choose a single destination, and go.
 
 “he Devils Thumb demarcates the Alaska-British-Columbia border east of Petersburg, a fishing village accessible only by boat or plane. There was regular jet service to Petersburg, but the sum of my liquid assets amounted to a 1960 Pontiac Star Chief and two hundred dollars in cash, not even enough for one-way airfare. So I drove as far as Gig Harbor, Washington, abandoned the car, and inveigled a ride on a northbound salmon seiner.”
 - wow, with very very little money, and enough sense to hitch a salmon boat
 
 “I was working then as an itinerant carpenter, framing condominiums in Boulder for $3.50 an hour. One afternoon, after nine hours of humping two-by-tens and driving sixteen-penny nails, I told my boss I was quitting: “No, not in a couple of weeks, Steve; right now was more like what I had in mind.” It took me a few hours to clear my tools and other belongings out of the crummy job-site trailer where I’d been squatting. And then I climbed into my car and departed for Alaska. I was surprised, as always, by how easy the act of leaving was, and how good it felt. The world was suddenly rich with possibility.”
 - also has no problems leaving society, not worrying about it
 
 “I was twenty-three, a year younger than Chris McCandless when he walked into the Alaska bush. My reasoning, if one can call it that, was inflamed by the scattershot passions of youth and a literary diet overly rich in the works of Nietzsche, Kerouac, and John Menlove Edwards,”
 - Jon Krakauer read Kerouac
 
 “In July 1992, two years after Chris left Atlanta, Billie was asleep in <strong>Chesapeake</strong> Beach when she sat bolt upright in the middle of the night, waking Walt. “I was sure I’d heard Chris calling me,” she insists, tears rolling down her cheeks. “I don’t know how I’ll ever get over it. I wasn’t dreaming. I didn’t imagine it. I heard his voice! He was begging, ‘Mom! Help me!’ But I couldn’t help him because I didn’t know where he was. And that was all he said: ‘Mom! Help me!’”
 - this makes me worry very much about Mom
 
 “As months passed without any word of Chris—and then years—the anguish mounted. Billie never left the house without leaving a note for Chris posted on the door. “Whenever we were out driving and saw a hitchhiker,” she says, “if he looked anything like Chris, we’d turn around and circle back. It was a terrible time. Night was the worst, especially when it was cold and stormy. You’d wonder, ‘Where is he? Is he warm? Is he hurt? Is he lonely? Is he OK?’”
 - mmm, Mom probably thinks in a similar way. Wow, years pass? Impossible, he’s only gone of two years. I’ve done a month though.
 
 “In the spring of 1990, when Walt, Billie, and Carine attended Chris’s graduation ceremony, they thought he seemed happy. As they watched him stride across the stage and take his diploma, he was grinning from ear to ear. He indicated that he was planning another extended trip but implied that he’d visit his family in Annandale before hitting the road. Shortly thereafter, he donated the balance of his bank account to OXFAM, loaded up his car, and vanished from their lives. From then on he scrupulously avoided contacting either his parents or Carine, the sister for whom he purportedly cared immensely.
 “We were all worried when we didn’t hear from him,” says Carine, “and I think my parents’ worry was mixed with hurt and anger. But I didn’t really feel hurt by his failure to write. I knew he was happy and doing what he wanted to do; I understood that it was important for him to see how independent he could be. And he knew that if he’d written or called me, Mom and Dad would find out where he was, fly out there, and try to bring him home.”
 - similar, but for me, there’s no chance that my parents would come and pick me up. I have no reason not to call. It’s just a feeling of being detached from society at the moment.
 
 “What does she mean ‘whoever I’m with?” Chris railed at his sister. “She must be rucking nuts. You know what I bet? I bet they think I’m a homosexual. How did they ever get that idea? What a bunch of imbeciles.”
 - mmm, appears homo, but isn’t.
 
 “Chris seldom contacted his parents that year, and because he had no phone, they couldn’t easily contact him. Walt and Billie grew increasingly worried about their son’s emotional distance. In a letter to Chris, Billie implored, “You have completely dropped away from all who love and care about you. Whatever it is—whoever you’re with—do you think this is right?” Chris saw this as meddling and referred to the letter as “stupid” when he talked to Carine.”
 - mmm, pressure from mother. Quite important though. I also didn’t have a phone, or, I chose not to use it. I still don’t.
 
 “During his senior year at Emory, Chris lived off campus in his bare, spartan room furnished with milk crates and a mattress on the floor. Few of his friends ever saw him outside of classes. A professor gave him a key for after-hours access to the library, where he spent much of his free time.”
 - lol, spartan is a good word. Milk crates are quite functional, moveable pieces of furniture. Ah, escape to library and media. Hmm. Sounds like my escape to films for a real education.
 
 “he grinding, dusty haul up the Alaska Highway was Chris’s first visit to the Far North. It was an abbreviated trip—he spent a short time around Fairbanks, then hurried south to get back to Atlanta in time for the start of fall classes—but he had been smitten by the vastness of the land, by the ghostly hue of the glaciers, by the pellucid subarctic sky. There was never any question that he would return.”
 - deadline of going back to school
 
 “To his dwindling number of confreres, McCandless appeared to grow more intense with each passing month. As soon as classes ended in the spring of 1989, Chris took his Datsun on another prolonged, extemporaneous road trip. “We only got two cards from him the whole summer,” says Walt. “The first one said, ‘Headed for Guatemala.’ When I read that I thought, ‘Oh, my God, he’s going down there to fight for the insurrectionists. They’re going to line him up in front of a wall and shoot him.’ Then toward the end of the summer, the second card arrived, and all it said was ‘Leaving Fairbanks tomorrow, see you in a couple of weeks.’ It turned out he’d changed his mind and instead of heading south had driven to Alaska.”
 - lol. No phones at that time? Could have used a payphone. But indeed, less and less contact.
 
 “As assistant editorial page editor of The Emory Wheel, he authored scores of commentaries. In reading them half a decade later, one is reminded how young McCandless was, and how passionate. The opinions he expressed in print, argued with idiosyncratic logic, were all over the map. He lampooned Jimmy Carter and Joe Biden, called for the resignation of Attorney General Edwin Meese, lambasted Bible-thumpers of the Christian right, urged vigilance against the Soviet threat, castigated the Japanese for hunting whales, and defended Jesse Jackson as a viable presidential candidate. In a typically immoderate declaration the lead sentence of McCandless’s editorial of March 1, 1988, reads, “We have now begun the third month of the year 1988, and already it is shaping up to be one of the most politically corrupt and scandalous years in modern history….” Chris Morris, the editor of the paper, remembers McCandless as “intense.”
 - one should be immoderate. Chris was right again.
 
 “Chris’s seemingly anomalous political positions were perhaps best summed up by Thoreau’s declaration in “Civil Disobedience”: “I heartily accept the motto—‘That government is best which governs least.’” Beyond that his views were not easily characterized.”
 - a very general view, but fits my autonomism ideals
 
 “That summer, Billie remembers, “Chris started complaining about all the rich kids at Emory.” More and more of the classes he took addressed such pressing social issues as racism and world hunger and inequities in the distribution of wealth.”
 - mmm, also did this earlier than me. Again, because I didn’t live in a city, or alone, away from my parent’s home bubble.
 
 “Chris was the sort of person who brooded about things,” Carine observes. “If something bothered him, he wouldn’t come right out and say it. He’d keep it to himself, harboring his resentment, letting the bad feelings build and build.” That seems to be what happened following the discoveries he made in El Segundo.”
 - mm, I do this too, and I still think it’s right not to bother unless it makes a behavioral change to a large amount of people. One person’s problems can easily be ignored.
 
 “Like many people, Chris apparently judged artists and close friends by their work, not their life, yet he was temperamentally incapable of extending such lenity to his father.”
 - I sure did judge artists by their work instead of their life, but coming from a large suburban house, that’s what probably normally happens, one has to consume media for an education
 
 “Children can be harsh judges when it comes to their parents, disinclined to grant clemency, and this was especially true in Chris’s case. More even than most teens, he tended to see things in black and white. He measured himself and those around him by an impossibly rigorous moral code.”
 - mmm, Rorschach / Kantian moral code
 
 “he summer between his sophomore and junior years Chris again returned to Annandale and took a job delivering pizzas for Domino’s. “He didn’t care that it wasn’t a cool thing to do,” says Carine. “He made a pile of money. I remember he’d come home every night and do his accounting at the kitchen table. It didn’t matter how tired he was; he’d figure out how many miles he drove, how much Domino’s paid him for gas, how much gas actually cost, his net profits for the evening, how it compared to the same evening the week before. He kept track of everything and showed me how to do it, how to make a business work. He didn’t seem interested in the money so much as the fact that he was good at making it. It was like a game, and the money was a way of keeping score.”
 - interesting to not care about the work and just get the money, as opposed to caring for all actions, including that which makes money
 - lol at the game analogy
 
 “I saw Chris at a party after his sophomore year at Emory,” remembers Eric Hathaway, “and it was obvious he had changed. He seemed very introverted, almost cold. When I said ‘Hey, good to see you, Chris,’ his reply was cynical: ‘Yeah, sure, that’s what everybody says.’ It was hard to get him to open up. His studies were the only thing he was interested in talking about.”
 - focused on work, impact, not the bullshit American society, especially college society
 
 “The summer after his freshman year of college, Chris returned to Annandale and worked for his parents’ company, developing computer software. “The program he wrote for us that summer was flawless,” says Walt. “We still use it today and have sold copies of the program to many clients. But when I asked Chris to show me how he wrote it, to explain why it worked the way it did, he refused. ‘All you need to know is that it works,’ he said. ‘You don’t need to know how or why.’ Chris was just being Chris, but it infuriated me. He would have made a great CIA agent—I’m serious; I know guys who work for the CIA. He told us what he thought we needed to know and nothing more. He was that way about everything.”
 - crazy, also developed computer software. Well maybe not, it’s work local to his parent’s house: DC.
 - also, Chris didn’t want to say more because it isn’t required to understand more. That would be a waste of time, of his, and, perhaps, of his father. Maybe. Perhaps just not interested in teaching, and prefers autodidact.
 
 “To his parents’ pleasant surprise, as the school year stretched on, Chris seemed thrilled to be at Emory. He shaved, trimmed his hair, and readopted the clean-cut look he’d had in high school. His grades were nearly perfect. He started writing for the school newspaper. He even talked enthusiastically about going on to get a law degree when he graduated. “Hey,” Chris boasted to Walt at one point, “I think my grades will be good enough to get into Harvard Law School.”
 - crazy how school can swerve one toward a systematic direction
 
 “During the course of his travels, Chris had acquired a machete and a .30-06 rifle, and when Walt and Billie drove him down to Atlanta to enroll in college, he insisted on taking the big knife and the gun with him. “When we went with Chris up to his dorm room,” Walt laughs, “I thought his roommate’s parents were going to have a stroke on the spot. The roommate was a preppy kid from Connecticut, dressed like Joe College, and Chris walks in with a scraggly beard and worn-out clothes, looking like Jeremiah Johnson, packing a machete and a deer-hunting rifle. But you know what? Within ninety days the preppy roommate had dropped out, while Chris had made the dean’s list.”
 - functional belongings are difficult to depart with
 - indeed, he’s serious about school
 
 “So at first I didn’t say anything about the safety aspect. I played tennis with Chris, talked about other things, then eventually sat down with him to discuss the risks he’d taken. I’d learned by then that a direct approach—‘By God, you better not try a stunt like that again!’—didn’t work with Chris. Instead, I tried to explain that we didn’t object to his travels; we just wanted him to be a little more careful and to keep us better informed of his whereabouts.”
 To Walt’s dismay Chris bristled at this small dollop of fatherly advice. The only effect it seemed to have was to make him even less inclined to share his plans.
 “Chris,” says Billie, “thought we were idiots for worrying about him.”
 - mmm
 
 “Near the end of his trip, it turned out, Chris had gotten lost in the Mojave Desert and had nearly succumbed to dehydration. His parents were extremely alarmed when they heard about this brush with disaster but were unsure how to persuade Chris to exercise more caution in the future. “Chris was good at almost everything he ever tried,” Walt reflects, “which made him supremely overconfident. If you attempted to talk him out of something, he wouldn’t argue. He’d just nod politely and then do exactly what he wanted.”
 - ah wow. I also had a few dangers: the ATV incident, and I still have to learn to swim.
 
 “After leaving Virginia, Chris drove south and then west across the flat Texas plains, through the heat of New Mexico and Arizona, and arrived at the Pacific coast. Initially, he honored the agreement to phone regularly, but as the summer wore on, the calls became less and less frequent. He didn’t appear back home until two days before the fall term was to start at Emory. When he walked into the Annandale house, he had a scruffy beard, his hair was long and tangled, and he’d shed thirty pounds from his already lean frame.”
 - sounds like me after any trip, lol. The calling part is a problem too, but less so when I’m in a city.
 
 “In 1986, on the sultry spring weekend that Chris graduated from Woodson High School, Walt and Billie threw a party for him. Walt’s birthday was June 10, just a few days away, and at the party Chris gave his father a present: a very expensive Questar telescope.
 “I remember sitting there when he gave Dad the telescope,” says Carine. “Chris had tossed back a few drinks that night and was pretty blitzed. He got real emotional. He was almost crying, fighting back the tears, telling Dad that even though they’d had their differences over the years, he was grateful for all the things Dad had done for him. Chris said how much he respected Dad for starting from nothing, working his way through college, busting his ass to support eight kids. It was a moving speech. Everybody there was all choked up. And then he left on his trip.”
 - sounds like how I feel, but, I never said it directly to him.
 
 “For children are innocent and love justice, while most of us are wicked and naturally prefer mercy.”
 - Chesterton
 
 “When I mentioned the offer to Chris,” says Walt, “he wouldn’t even consider it. He told his boss that he had other plans.” As soon as high school was over, Chris declared, he was going to get behind the wheel of his new car and spend the summer driving across the country.”
 - sounds like my confidence after my first job
 
 “In a matter of a few months, half a dozen other students were working under him, and he’d put seven thousand dollars into his bank account. He used part of the money to buy the yellow Datsun, the secondhand B210.”
 - my Mazda 3 was far more expensive purchase, but similar in that it was a compact, desired hatchback, and okay fuel efficiency
 
 “Her son, the teenage Tolstoyan, believed that wealth was shameful, corrupting, inherently evil—which is ironic because Chris was a natural-born capitalist with an uncanny knack for making a buck. “Chris was always an entrepreneur,” Billie says with a laugh. “Always.”
 - mmm, capitalism as outlet and motivation for creativity as a kid. Sold vegetables and printer copies
 
 “hey didn’t flaunt their modest wealth, but they bought nice clothes, some jewelry for Billie, a Cadillac. Eventually, they purchased the townhouse on the bay and the sailboat. They took the kids to Europe, skiing in Breckenridge, on a Caribbean cruise. And Chris, Billie acknowledges, “was embarrassed by all that.”
 - mmmm, I really shouldn’t have gone on that Caribbean trip. I was really old at that time. Very embarrassing for myself at that time, not so much for my family. That’s okay, I understood that they’re human.
 
 “McCandless’s personality was puzzling in its complexity. He was intensely private but could be convivial and gregarious in the extreme. And despite his overdeveloped social conscience, he was no tight-lipped, perpetually grim do-gooder who frowned on fun. To the contrary, he enjoyed tipping a glass now and then and was an incorrigible ham.”
 - yeah, I enjoyed social life, but didn’t enjoy the norms of consumption of commodity, wasting wealth for fun. Nature is better.
 
 “Chris brought home good grades,” says Hathaway. “He didn’t get into trouble, he was a high achiever, he did what he was supposed to. His parents didn’t really have grounds to complain. But they got on his case about going to college; and whatever they said to him, it must have worked. Because he ended up going to Emory, even though he thought it was pointless, a waste of time and money.”
 - mmm, a bit ahead of me here too. He actually thought of not going to college, whereas I didn’t think much of college but attended anyway. Though I care for social problems, I didn’t have the independence to learn how much a waste of money college is, also a waste of time.
 
 “On one occasion Chris picked up a homeless man from the streets of D.C., brought him home to leafy, affluent Annandale, and secretly set the guy up in the Airstream trailer his parents parked beside the garage”
 …
 “On another occasion Chris drove over to Hathaway’s house and announced they were going downtown. “Cool!” Hathaway remembers thinking. “It was a Friday night, and I assumed we were headed to Georgetown to party. Instead, Chris parked down on Fourteenth Street, which at the time was a real bad part of town. Then he said, ‘You know, Eric, you can read about this stuff, but you can’t understand it until you live it. Tonight that’s what we’re going to do.’ We spent the next few hours hanging out in creepy places, talking with pimps and hookers and lowlife. I was, like, scared.
 “Toward the end of the evening, Chris asked me how much money I had. I said five dollars. He had ten. ‘OK, you buy the gas,’ he told me; ‘I’m going to get some food.’ So he spent the ten bucks on a big bag of hamburgers, and we drove around handing them out to smelly guys sleeping on grates. It was the weirdest Friday night of my life. But Chris did that kind of thing a lot.”
 - mirrors my interest in homeless people, but in a rather different way. While I was into documenting them, or interviewing them, he was actually already taking actions, and he was a few years younger than me at that time. I only did that once I went to San Francisco. Though, the encounter with homeless people only occurred because I moved to a city, where I interact with them.
 - more direct actions
 
 “On weekends, when his high school pals were attending “keggers” and trying to sneak into Georgetown bars, McCandless would wander the seedier quarters of Washington, chatting with prostitutes and homeless people, buying them meals, earnestly suggesting ways they might improve their lives.
 “Chris didn’t understand how people could possibly be allowed to go hungry, especially in this country,” says Billie. “He would rave about that kind of thing for hours.”
 - not afraid of the inner city, and doesn’t understand human psyche, but trying to help. Also, living in America still doesn’t make sense how bad inequality is, or how people still do not have homes or food or how prostitution exists.
 
 “McCandless took life’s inequities to heart. During his senior year at Woodson, he became obsessed with racial oppression in South Africa. He spoke seriously to his friends about smuggling weapons into that country and joining the struggle to end apartheid. “We’d get into arguments about it once in a while,” recalls Hathaway. “Chris didn’t like going through channels, working within the system, waiting his turn. He’d say, ‘Come on, Eric, we can raise enough money to go to South Africa on our own, right now. It’s just a matter of deciding to do it.’ I’d counter by saying we were only a couple of kids, that we couldn’t possibly make a difference. But you couldn’t argue with him. He’d come back with something like ‘Oh, so I guess you just don’t care about right and wrong.’”
 - mmmmmmmmmmmmmmm, maybe the most affecting part for me. Wants to make a sociocultural difference, but not through a system. Direct intervention. It’s as simple as that: “It’s just a matter of deciding to do it”.
 
 “He internalized the disappointment. He’d go off alone somewhere and beat himself up.
 “It wasn’t just running Chris took so seriously,” Gillmer adds. “He was like that about everything. You aren’t supposed to think about heavy-duty stuff in high school. But I did, and he did, too, which is why we hit it off. We’d hang out during snack break at his locker and talk about life, the state of the world, serious things. I’m black, and I could never figure out why everyone made such a big deal about race. Chris would talk to me about that kind of thing. He understood. He was always questioning stuff in the same way. I liked him a lot. He was a really good guy.”
 - good diverse upbringing in suburban America
 
 “He was really into pushing himself,” explains Gordy Cucullu, a younger member of the team. “Chris invented this workout he called Road Warriors: He would lead us on long, killer runs through places like farmers’ fields and construction sites, places we weren’t supposed to be, and intentionally try to get us lost. We’d run as far and as fast as we could, down strange roads, through the woods, whatever. The whole idea was to lose our bearings, to push ourselves into unknown territory. Then we’d run at a slightly slower pace until we found a road we recognized and race home again at full speed. In a certain sense that’s how Chris lived his entire life.”
 - hahaha this is amazing, reminds me of my biking explorations with friends on my street. It’s also creative and rewarding. Creative in constantly learning to find the quickest route possible, like parkour, and rewarding because one actually physically explores new areas, learning more of reality. It’s empirical, and fun.
 
 “He tried his hand at many sports but had little patience for learning the finer points of any of them.”
 …
 “Chris had so much natural talent,” Walt continues, “but if you tried to coach him, to polish his skill, to bring out that final ten percent, a wall went up. He resisted instruction of any kind.”
 - no patience, or, does not care for mastering things. Not necessary. Understands it, then moves on. No need to waste time on the last 10%.
 
 “A gifted French-horn player, as a teen he was a member of the American University Symphony but quit, according to Walt, after objecting to rules imposed by a high school band leader.”
 - always leaves because rules waste time.
 
 “Their musical rivalry seems not to have damaged the relationship between Chris and Carine, however. They’d been best friends from an early age, spending hours together building forts out of cushions and blankets in their Annandale living room. “He was always really nice to me,” Carine says, “and extremely protective. He’d hold my hand when we walked down the street. When he was in junior high and I was still in grade school, he got out earlier than me, but he’d hang out at his friend Brian Paskowitz’s house so we could walk home together.”
 - :). Maybe I wouldn’t be a bad older brother?
 
 “Walt grows quiet, staring absently into the distance. “Chris was fearless even when he was little,” he says after a long pause. “He didn’t think the odds applied to him. We were always trying to pull him back from the edge.”
 - edge of society.
 
 “Much of the food he put on the table came from hunting—despite the fact that he was uncomfortable killing animals. “My dad cried every time he shot a deer,” Billie says, “but we had to eat, so he did it.”
 - mmm, good argument for vegetarian
 
 “But there were good times, too. On weekends and when school was out, the family took to the road: They drove to Virginia Beach and the Carolina shore, to Colorado to visit Walt’s kids from his first marriage, to the Great Lakes, to the Blue Ridge Mountains. “We camped out of the back of the truck, the Chevy Suburban,” Walt explains. “Later we bought an Airstream trailer and traveled with that. Chris loved those trips, the longer the better. There was always a little wanderlust in the family, and it was clear early on that Chris had inherited it.”
 In the course of their travels, the family visited Iron Mountain, Michigan, a small mining town in the forests of the Upper Peninsula that was Billie’s childhood home…”
 - family trips, yay
 
 “At the age of two, he got up in the middle of the night, found his way outside without waking his parents, and entered a house down the street to plunder a neighbor’s candy drawer.”
 - age 2 or 4?
 
 “Walt bought Billie a Gianini guitar, on which she strummed lullabies to soothe the fussy newborn. Twenty-two years later, rangers from the National Park Service would find that same guitar on the backseat of a yellow Datsun abandoned near the shore of Lake Mead.”
 - important belonging to go back for
 
 “NEED FOR A PURPOSE” HAD BEEN WRITTEN
 IN MCCANDLESS’S HAND IN THE MARGIN ABOVE THE PASSAGE.”
 - thoughts while reading book, grabbing knowledge, or organizing a book’s ideas which relate to my current thoughts / life
 
 “Westerberg pawed through the files at the grain elevator until he found two W-4 forms McCandless had filled out. Across the top of the first one, dating from McCandless’s initial visit to Carthage, in 1990, he had scrawled “EXEMPT EXEMPT EXEMPT EXEMPT” and given his name as Iris Fucyu. Address: “None of your damn business.” Social Security number: “I forget.”
 But on the second form, dated March 30, 1992, two weeks before he left for Alaska, he’d signed his given name: “Chris J. McCandless.” And in the blank for Social Security number he’d put down, “228-31-6704.” Westerberg phoned Alaska again. This time the troopers took him seriously.”
 - hahahaha, I do this at times too. Silly bureaucracy.
 
 “The papar risked their lives—and lost them in untold droves—not in the pursuit of wealth or personal glory or to claim new lands in the name of any despot. As the great arctic explorer and Nobel laureate Fridtjof Nansen points out, “these remarkable voyages were … undertaken chiefly from the wish to find lonely places, where these anchorites might dwell in peace, undisturbed by the turmoil and temptations of the world.” When the first handful of Norwegians showed up on the shores of Iceland in the ninth century, the papar decided the country had become too crowded—even though it was still all but uninhabited. The monks’ response was to climb into their curraghs and row off toward Greenland. They were drawn across the storm-racked ocean, drawn west past the edge of the known world, by nothing more than a hunger of the spirit, a yearning of such queer intensity that it beggars the modern imagination.”
 - hmm, from Ireland to Iceland to a little island nearby, they physically kept escaping society
 
 “Sleight believes that if Ruess had made it across the river alive and reached the reservation, it would have been impossible for him to conceal his presence “even if he was still playing his Nemo game. Everett was a loner, but he liked people too damn much to stay down there and live in secret the rest of his life. A lot of us are like that—I’m like that, Ed Abbey was like that, and it sounds like this McCandless kid was like that: We like companionship, see, but we can’t stand to be around people for very long. So we go get ourselves lost, come back for a while, then get the hell out again. And that’s what Everett was doing.”
 - yep, love people and talking, but need time away from society
 
 “Half of the ten sunniest places on record are in the American southwest states of Arizona, Nevada and Texas.”
 - http://www.currentresults.com/Weather-Extremes/sunniest-places-countries-world.php
 - Travelers, especially campers, are attracted to the sun, just as I am in Asia. It’s no wonder they end up in the sunniest of places. I think McCandless made the mistake of going to a cold place.
 
 “For two days I couldn’t tell whether I was dead or alive. I writhed and twisted in the heat, with swarms of ants and flies crawling over me, while the poison oozed and crusted on my face and arms and back. I ate nothing—there was nothing to do but suffer philosophically….
 I get it every time, but I refuse to be driven out of the woods.”
 - hah, it reminds me of my sicknesses during travel. Mostly stomach viruses.
 - this is a quite silly decision, to not get poison ivy medicine, especially since it’s semi-annual.
 
 “Ruess was just as romantic as McCandless, if not more so, and equally heedless of personal safety. Clayborn Lockett, an archaeologist who briefly employed Ruess as a cook while excavating an Anasazi cliff dwelling in 1934, told Rusho that “he was appalled by the seemingly reckless manner in which Everett moved around dangerous cliffs.”
 …
 “Indeed, Ruess himself boasts in one of his letters, “Hundreds of times I have trusted my life to crumbling sandstone and nearly vertical edges in the search for water or cliff dwellings. Twice I was nearly gored to death by a wild bull. But always, so far, I’ve escaped unscathed and gone forth to other adventures.” And in his final letter Ruess nonchalantly confesses to his brother:”
 - safety depends on the mind and body, not by policy. Here, I believe, Ruess was right. One cannot comprehend the infinite decisions that go on while climbing a mountain, it is dexterity, and only the adventurer understands their body enough to make those decisions.
 
 “and hundreds of houses of the cliff dwellers, abandoned a thousand years ago.”
 - living in abandoned abodes! very good idea.
 
 “I have always been unsatisfied with life as most people live it. Always I want to live more intensely and richly.”
 - mmm, intensely and richly.
 
 “The beauty of this country is becoming part of me. I feel more detached from life and somehow gentler….”
 - I’ve felt this with Taiwan, but I didn’t feel detached from life until I became stuck inside a closed space. I’ve always felt close with the people of Taiwan, not just the country. The city and small towns, not pure nature. I’ve only felt detached when away from people: scooter trips and time not spent with friends or in public areas such as markets.
 
 “…I have some good friends here, but no one who really understands why I am here or what I do. I don’t know of anyone, though, who would have more than a partial understanding; I have gone too far alone.”
 - his mind and interests are too far from society. Happens to me with philosophical thoughts, but now I’ve got e-books which help, some. I don’t have to be alone. I can talk to people using cellular data, real people or a medium of information.
 
 “I have been thinking more and more that I shall always be a lone wanderer of the wilderness. God, how the trail lures me. You cannot comprehend its resistless fascination for me. After all the lone trail is the best…. I’ll never stop wandering.”
 - feels that he will never fit society, and simultaneously never stop wondering.
 
 “At eighteen, in a dream, he saw himself plodding through jungles, chinning up the ledges of cliffs, wandering through the romantic waste places of the world. No man with any of the juices of boyhood in him has forgotten those dreams. The peculiar thing about Everett Ruess was that he went out and did the things he dreamed about, not simply for a two-weeks’ vacation in the civilized and trimmed wonderlands, but for months and years in the very midst of wonder….”
 - mmm, dreamed and did. Easy to get out of society.
 
 “I had some terrific experiences in the wilderness since I wrote you last—overpowering, overwhelming,” he gushed to his friend Cornel Tengel. “But then I am always being overwhelmed. I require it to sustain life.”
 - sounds like me or Peter Pan at times
 
 “At the end of the summer, Everett returned home only long enough to earn a high school diploma, which he received in January 1931. Less than a month later he was on the road again, tramping alone through the canyon lands of Utah, Arizona, and New Mexico, then a region nearly as sparsely populated and wrapped in mystique as Alaska is today. Except for a short, unhappy stint at UCLA (he dropped out after a single semester, to his father’s lasting dismay), two extended visits with his parents, and a winter in San Francisco (where he insinuated himself into the company of Dorothea Lange, Ansel Adams, and the painter Maynard Dixon), Ruess would spend the remainder of his meteoric life on the move, living out of a backpack on very little money, sleeping in the dirt, cheerfully going hungry for days at a time.”
 - similar to my short period at Parson’s, and love for city artists
 
 “In Los Angeles, Everett attended the Otis Art School and Hollywood High. As a sixteen-year-old he embarked on his first long solo trip, spending the summer of 1930 hitchhiking and trekking through Yosemite and Big Sur, ultimately winding up in Carmel. Two days after arriving in the latter community, he brazenly knocked on the door of Edward Weston, who was sufficiently charmed by the overwrought young man to humor him. Over the next two months the eminent photographer encouraged the boy’s uneven but promising efforts at painting and block printing, and permitted Ruess to hang around his studio with his own sons, Neil and Cole.”
 - just do shit!
 
 “the Ruesses were also a nomadic family, moving from Oakland to Fresno to Los Angeles to Boston to Brooklyn to New Jersey to Indiana before finally settling in southern California when Everett was fourteen.”
 
 “It is true that I miss intelligent companionship, but there are so few with whom I can share the things that mean so much to me that I have learned to contain myself.”
 - mmm, not worth the cost of being a part of society
 
 —
 ... as to when I revisit civilization, it will not be soon. I have not tired of the wilderness... It is enough that I am surrounded with beauty... This had been a full, rich year. I have left no strange or delightful thing undone I wanted to do.
 - a full year of experience! Amazing.
 
 Everett wrote no books during his life, but was a lifelong diarist and sent home hundreds of letters.[16] His journals, art, and poetry were later published in two books
 - lifelong diarist. Keep on living, let someone organize the shit you think for you.
 
 Starting in 1931, Ruess traveled by horse and burro through Arizona, New Mexico, Utah, and Colorado, the high desert Colorado Plateau. He rode broncos, branded calves, and investigated cliff dwellings, trading his prints and watercolors to pay his way. He explored Sequoia and Yosemite National Parks and the High Sierra in the summers of 1930 and 1933. In 1934, he worked with University of California archaeologists near Kayenta, took part in a Hopi religious ceremony, and learned to speak Navajo.

 “He was an extremely intense young man and possessed a streak of stubborn idealism that did not mesh readily with modern existence. ”
 
 “Alex’s backpack looked as though it weighed only twenty-five or thirty pounds”
 
 “Still, Gallien was concerned. Alex admitted that the only food in his pack was a ten-pound bag of rice. His gear seemed exceedingly minimal for the harsh conditions of the interior, which in April still lay buried under the winter snowpack. Alex’s cheap leather hiking boots were neither waterproof nor well insulated. His rifle was only .22 caliber, a bore too small to rely on if he expected to kill large animals like moose and caribou, which he would have to eat if he hoped to remain very long in the country. He had no ax, no bug dope, no snowshoes, no compass. The only navigational aid in his possession was a tattered state road map he’d scrounged at a gas station.”
 
 expensive backpack
 
 “a diary—written across the last two pages of a field guide to edible plants—that recorded the young man’s final weeks in 113 terse, enigmatic entries.”
 
 “and asked Alex how long it’d been since he ate. Alex allowed how it’d been a couple of days. Said he’d kind of run out of money.” Overhearing this, the friend’s wife insisted on cooking Alex a big dinner, which he wolfed down, and then he fell asleep at the table.”
 
 “. If he started a job, he’d finish it. It was almost like a moral thing for him. He was what you’d call extremely ethical. He set pretty high standards for himself.”
 
 “You could tell right away that Alex was intelligent,” Westerberg reflects, draining his third drink. “He read a lot. Used a lot of big words. I think maybe part of what got him into trouble was that he did too much thinking. Sometimes he tried too hard to make sense of the world, to figure out why people were bad to each other so often. A couple of times I tried to tell him it was a mistake to get too deep into that kind of stuff, but Alex got stuck on things. He always had to know the absolute right answer before he could go on to the next thing.”
 
 “That fall he developed a lasting bond with both the town and Wayne Westerberg.”
 
 “The attachment McCandless felt for Carthage remained powerful, however. Before departing, he gave Westerberg a treasured 1942 edition of Tolstoy’s War and Peace.”
 
 “And McCandless stayed in touch with Westerberg as he roamed the West, calling or writing Carthage every month or two. He had all his mail forwarded to Westerberg’s address and told almost everyone he met thereafter that South Dakota was his home.”
 - semi-anonymous dwelling with capital production. Ace.
 
 “history and anthropology major”
 
 “He was offered membership in Phi Beta Kappa but declined, insisting that titles and honors are irrelevant.”
 - :)
 
 “She was surprised and extremely touched: It was the first present she had received from her son in more than two years, since he had announced to his parents that, on principle, he would no longer give or accept gifts.”
 
 “Chris had purchased the secondhand yellow Datsun when he was a senior in high school. In the years since, he’d been in the habit of taking it on extended solo road trips when classes weren’t in session, and during that graduation weekend he casually mentioned to his parents that he intended to spend the upcoming summer on the road as well. His exact words were “I think I’m going to disappear for a while.”
 
 “Here is a copy of my final transcript. Gradewise things went pretty well and I ended up with a high cumulative average.
 Thankyou for the pictures, the shaving gear, and the postcard from Paris. It seems that you really enjoyed your trip there. It must have been a lot of fun.
 I gave Lloyd [Chris’s closest friend at Emory] his picture, and he was very grateful; he did not have a shot of his diploma getting handed to him.
 Not much else happening, but it’s starting to get real hot and humid down here. Say Hi to everyone for me.”
 - very functional letters, and “not much going on here” type of lack of talk, as opposed to talks of travels to strangers
 
 “During that final year in Atlanta, Chris had lived off campus in a monkish room furnished with little more than a thin mattress on the floor, milk crates, and a table. He kept it as orderly and spotless as a military barracks. And he didn’t have a phone, so Walt and Billie had no way of calling him.”
 - mininmalism
 
 “By then Chris was long gone. Five weeks earlier he’d loaded all his belongings into his little car and headed west without an itinerary.”
 - no itinerary
 
 “Alex finds Mexicans to be warm, friendly people. Much more hospitable than Americans….”
 - :)
 
 “Having reached his destination, McCandless slowed his pace, and his mood became more contemplative. He took photographs of a tarantula, plaintive sunsets, windswept dunes, the long curve of empty coastline. The journal entries become short and perfunctory. He wrote fewer than a hundred words over the month that followed.”
 
 “On January 16, McCandless left the stubby metal boat on a hummock of dune grass southeast of El Golfo de Santa Clara and started walking north up the deserted beach. He had not seen or talked to another soul in thirty-six days. For that entire period he subsisted on nothing but five pounds of rice and what marine life he could pull from the sea, an experience that would later convince him he could survive on similarly meager rations in the Alaska bush.”
 - wow, just rice?
 
 “To avoid being rolled by the unsavory characters who rule the streets and freeway overpasses where he slept, he learned to bury what money he had before entering a city, then recover it on the way out of town.”
 - hmm
 
 “On February 3, according to his journal, McCandless went to Los Angeles “to get a ID and a job but feels extremely uncomfortable in society now and must return to road immediately.”
 - yes
 
 “On February 24, seven and a half months after he abandoned the Datsun, McCandless returned to Detrital Wash. The Park Service had long since impounded the vehicle, but he unearthed his old Virginia plates, SJF-421, and a few belongings he’d buried there.”
 - material belongings still important? Or to avoid identity?
 
 “Then he hitched into Las Vegas and found a job at an Italian restaurant. “Alexander buried his backpack in the desert on 2/27 and entered Las Vegas with no money and no ID,” the journal tells us.”
 - hmm, to avoid losing anything?
 
 “He lived on the streets with bums, tramps, and winos for several weeks. Vegas would not be the end of the story, however. On May 10, itchy feet returned and Alex left his job in Vegas, retrieved his backpack, and hit the road again, though he found that if you are stupid enough to bury a camera underground you won’t be taking many pictures with it afterwards. Thus the story has no picture book for the period May 10, 1991-January 7, 1992. But this is not important. It is the experiences, the memories, the great triumphant joy of living to the fullest extent in which real meaning is found. God it’s great to be alive! Thank you. Thank you.”
 - :)
 
 “When his camera was ruined and McCandless stopped taking photographs, he also stopped keeping a journal, a practice he didn’t resume until he went to Alaska the next year. Not a great deal is known, therefore, about where he traveled after departing Las Vegas in May 1991.”
 - stopped because he was experiencing life! Fuck writing.
 
 “the fog and rain was often intolerable.”
 - :)
 
 “ In September he hitched down U.S. Highway 101 into California, then headed east into the desert again. And by early October he had landed in Bullhead City, Arizona.”
 - toward the heat again and again, so why north?
 
 “On the face of it, Bullhead City doesn’t seem like the kind of place that would appeal to an adherent of Thoreau and Tolstoy, an ideologue who expressed nothing but contempt for the bourgeois trappings of mainstream America. McCandless, nevertheless, took a strong liking to Bullhead. Maybe it was his affinity for the lumpen, who were well represented in the community’s trailer parks and campgrounds and laundromats; perhaps he simply fell in love with the stark desert landscape that encircles the town.
 In any case, when he arrived in Bullhead City, McCandless stopped moving for more than two months—probably the longest he stayed in one place from the time he left Atlanta until he went to Alaska and moved into the abandoned bus on the Stampede Trail. In a card he mailed to Westerberg in October, he says of Bullhead, “It’s a good place to spend the winter and I might finally settle down and abandon my tramping life, for good. I’ll see what happens when spring comes around, because that’s when I tend to get really itchy feet.”
 - yes, winter hibernation and summer itchy feet
 
 “At the time he wrote these words, he was holding down a full-time job, flipping Quarter Pounders at a McDonald’s on the main drag, commuting to work on a bicycle. Outwardly, he was living a surprisingly conventional existence, even going so far as to open a savings account at a local bank.”
 - things get conventional in the winter
 
 “McCandless had tried to disguise the fact that he was a drifter living out of a backpack: He told his fellow employees that he lived across the river in Laughlin.”
 - shame? Well, what can one say to normative culture people that don’t understand nomadism?
 
 “In fact, during his first several weeks in Bullhead, McCandless camped out in the desert at the edge of town; then he started squatting in a vacant mobile home. The latter arrangement, he explained in a letter to Jan Burres, “came about this way:”
 - hah, my current thought / move. Camp and make some money!
 
 “Thanks so much for the Christmas card. It’s nice to be thought of this time of year…. I’m so excited to hear that you will be coming to see me, you’re welcome any time. It’s really great to think that after almost a year and a half we shall be meeting again.”
 - meeting people after a year and a half
 
 “Sometimes I think it was like he was storing up company for the times when he knew nobody would be around.”
 
 “McCandless was especially attentive to Burres, flirting and clowning with her at every opportunity. “He liked to tease me and torment me,” she recalls. “I’d go out back to hang clothes on the line behind the trailer, and he’d attach clothespins all over me. He was playful, like a little kid. I had puppies, and he was always putting them under laundry baskets to watch them bounce around and yelp. He’d do it till I’d get mad and have to yell at him to stop. But in truth he was real good with the dogs. They’d follow him around, cry after him, want to sleep with him. Alex just had a way with animals.”
 - good females
 
 “It is true that many creative people fail to make mature personal relationships, and some are extremely isolated. It is also true that, in some instances, trauma, in the shape of early separation or bereavement, has steered the potentially creative person toward developing aspects of his personality which can find fulfillment in comparative isolation. But this does not mean that solitary, creative pursuits are themselves pathological….
 [A]voidance behavior is a response designed to protect the infant from behavioural disorganization. If we transfer this concept to adult life, we can see that an avoidant infant might very well develop into a person whose principal need was to find some kind of meaning and order in life which was not entirely, or even chiefly, dependent upon interpersonal relationships.”
 - solitude: return to the self
 
 “I don’t recollect Alex ever talking about any girlfriends,” says Westerberg. “Although a couple of times he mentioned wanting to get married and have a family some day. You could tell he didn’t take relationships lightly. He wasn’t the kind of guy who would go out and pick up girls just to get laid.”
 - serious
 
 “In high school McCandless had enjoyed a close rapport with two or three members of the opposite sex, and Carine recalls one instance when he got drunk and tried to bring a girl up to his bedroom in the middle of the night (they made so much noise stumbling up the stairs that Billie was awakened and sent the girl home). But there is little evidence that he was sexually active as a teenager and even less to suggest that he slept with any woman after graduating from high school. (Nor, for that matter, is there any evidence that he was ever sexually intimate with a man.) It seems that McCandless was drawn to women but remained largely or entirely celibate, as chaste as a monk.”
 - mmm
 
 “When McCandless hugged Borah good-bye, she says, “I noticed he was crying. That frightened me. He wasn’t planning on being gone all that long; I figured he wouldn’t have been crying unless he intended to take some big risks and knew he might not be coming back. That’s when I started having a bad feeling that we wouldn’t never see Alex again.”
 - crying because he left another society, a good one
 
 “Hey Guys!
 This is the last communication you shall receive from me. I now walk out to live amongst the wild. Take care, it was great knowing you.
 ALEXANDER.”
 - hmm, determined to live self-reliantly
 
 “It may, after all, be the bad habit of creative talents to invest themselves in pathological extremes that yield remarkable insights but no durable way of life for those who cannot translate their psychic wounds into significant art or thought.”
 - very good quote by Jon Krakaeur to choose

 An old thought that's come up several times invoked by Taiwan's quick adaptation and prevalent use of AirBnB and Uber, then to an old thought about Yelp, then to eBay.
 
 Let's start with Uber. Uber I'm told is a peer-to-peer car sharing service. The first problem is that few people <em>should</em> have a car. If one lives in an area that has sufficient public transportation, or a bike-able area, a car has little use. If not, one should move closer, or talk about updating the urban plan. It's good to make use of old technology [cars], but one should be aware of the work that goes into creating a car and getting oil.
 
 The next problem, perhaps the greatest, seems to occur in several things that come out of Silicon Valley. Uber and AirBnB are for-profit. Sharing in my mind is not for-profit, and the word sharing economy is an oxymoron. This changes the behavior of people as capitalism does, often into something quite disgusting. There is a difference between the person who uses Uber and the person who picks up hitchhikers; The same difference exists between AirBnB and CouchSurfing. The main reason someone is using these services as a provider or host is because they want the money, and it doesn't require much work for it.
 
 In order for a transaction to occur one person must have an asset or property to rent out. One person accumulated enough capital to own a superfluous asset and is now using it to rent it out for short periods of time. Without a convenient service, it is likely seen as waste of time for the owner, but enabled by convenience and motivated by money, it's easier to be nudged to make this the decision of using these kinds of services.
 
 [The services enable people to make a decision they aware of themselves: to hitch or to exchange hospitality. If people though of these ideas before they wouldn't have used taxis or motels in the past.]
 
 A lot of these criticisms started with my experience with Yelp when I lived in San Francisco. I used it for anything: food, grocery stores, laundry, doctors, real futons, supply stores, etc, but mostly, food by searching nearby, or planning trips while exploring neighborhoods to live in. It was good to leave honest reviews, never really giving anything a two or below knowing that people care, or that it can ruin a business. But it was apparent that the Yelp <strong>caused people to focus their awareness to the places listed on the website</strong>, and further narrowed to those with good reviews, increasing the business of already popular places. <strong>Instead of doing everything within one's locale, physically exploring nearby locations, meeting and talking to neighbors, one uses information then makes the decision.</strong> The area I chose to live was so convenient that I'd end up doing any kind of business on within a few blocks radius. I'd often just write reviews for them, which often had no reviews or were not eve listed. Other times, I'd go exploring the city, have an experience with a place, maybe a homely Filipino restaurant or the neighborhood it was in, and write about that. My hope was to bring awareness of these other places, usually local or in working class ethnic enclaves. It probably didn't work.
 
 The effects of eBay is wild, and this thought predates Yelp. Nearly everything I've ordered came from China or Taiwan. eBay facilitates global capitalism. People in less developed countries are producing higher quantity and quality and more customized things, somehow at a cheaper price, although it is coming from the other side of the world. Competition is okay, but for people to shift their actions toward producing items for the conspicuous consumption of people from more developed countries is not. There's a lot of work to be done in China in regards to basic development needs, yet it must sell useless commodities to get the money in order to develop itself? Capitalism makes <a href="http://genius.com/Das-racist-rapping-2-u-lyrics">my mother fuckin' mind melt</a>.
 
 The pro of all of these is that it provides a service of getting something (hospitality, car ride, products, information) desired conveniently, at one's personal computer. The con, usually limited to those who have enough money to use these services, is that people are dulled into buying things instead of interacting with the people around, using other forms of transportation, creatively using the material around them, and living in reality.
 
 It seems the only place that has even checked what comes in the country, careful of it's effects, is Berlin, Germany, whom banned Uber and is cracking down on house rentals, which is fitting as I read this short introduction to the very careful Habermas.
 
 I often think of Silicon Valley (and unfortunately now, San Francisco) as a kind of social zero entropy. There are some somewhat good intentions in there, but it's only valuable to the class that created it: themselves. [It's like the failure of the bourgeois public sphere trying to govern all people.] The people lack experience outside of the area, and even much of the area they live in (Oakland, ethnic enclaves), to make any decisions toward anything other than making the machine that is the Valley more efficient. Silicon Valley is in a cycle that creates things to make itself more efficient -- materially through industry and socially through industrious work.
 
 Therefore, the products created by this machine are meant for the culture of the machine. Unfortunately, the industry has physically manufactured devices for a global scale, and then created software for those devices, without thought or care of the effects to other cultures. Now, the software affects the behaviors of people around the world. [Hmm, maybe not much argument here, just normal global capitalism effects]
 
 In Taipei alone, non-Taiwanese people use Tinder to get a quick fuck, Taiwanese people use a local Tinder clone to actually meet people, AirBnB (and other hostel websites) to convert apartments into dormitory hostels for tourists, Uber to also rakes profit from tourists, and Taobao (China's eBay) to obtain items at an even lower price.
 
 Instead of healthy neighborhoods and communities in which resources and services are shared through local relationships, the community is online with people willing to sell or rent resources and services. Instead of genuine experiences such ask asking people for a night, a ride, walking around the streets, or even just talking and meeting people nearby, the Valley's culture first looks at information to make decisions, then acts upon it in reality. As a result, such decisions are always exclusive. There is no interaction with reality which provides a random set information [, which is then filtered by the mind's awareness] to inform the decision. 5020 2015-11-18 13:28:12 2015-11-18 18:28:12 open closed silicon-valley-and-capitalism publish 0 0 post 0 Critical Theory Ethics Humanities Philosophy Philosophy of Technology Rationality _edit_last 1 _yoast_wpseo_primary_category Why Did I Read? http://rahilpatel.com/blog/why-did-i-read Wed, 02 Dec 2015 12:19:33 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=5187 This is part of a <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/valuable-things-ive-written#criticism_capitalism_communication_rationality">series of thoughts that are thematically bounded by a criticism of capitalism, communication, and rationality</a>.
 
 [todo: old title: why I read, and how and when to read]
 
 [todo: needs work]
 
 The reason <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/what-is-worth-reading">I began reading</a> is because I wanted to talk about things that I experience in the world, from epistemology to the culture I've lived in and back. I'm not sure if describing it adds to understanding or merely transforming ideas into language, and therefore quite a waste of time as one could be experiencing and learning and acting instead, or even transforming ideas into a more <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/the-most-powerful-forms-of-art">potent medium</a>.
 
 In the process of describing the world, I use Wikipedia and <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/a-liberal-arts-self-study-curriculum">other forms of modern media</a> to gather ideas. Because of this, <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/a-curriculum-of-experience#reading">books of my interest</a> tend to be <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/a-curriculum-of-experience#critical_theory">theoretical</a>. They provide words, ideas, and frameworks to help me continue to talk to myself in order to continue thinking about the world. It's not a matter of truth. These things just serve as <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/tools-for-organizing">tool for organizing</a> the big picture. Though, this too may be a waste of time, as it's much more efficient to simply make up words for ideas that one thinks of. And the existence of common words create a bias of what one thinks about, as the mind focuses on the language, instead of reality and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacit_knowledge">infinite amount of ideas behind reality</a>. And again, I run into the <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/information-media-and-education">limits of language</a>. Isn't it better to skip language formation and simply act? But then one often needs to communicate to others for socio-political reasons. Hrmm... I miss playing games. [todo: should continue this thought]
 
 To to get the most out of media one must match it to one's current desire of knowledge and/or current experiences, as to aid one's own understand and creation of theories. In my case: Jane Jacobs would be helpful in trying to improve a neighborhood, and would be good to read while living in a city. David Harvey would be helpful in trying to understand capital in modern times, and would be good to read while living in a capitalistic society. Anthropology is helpful to look at many societies at all levels of development to see what works and where society screwed up, and would be best to read while traveling, or living in another society. Daniel Kahneman is helpful in understand the decisions people make, and should be read when is trying to influence behavior. Practical handbooks is helpful for things one may want to do very soon, and should be read close in time. And so on.
 
 The desire for socio-political change may take creative forms, which simply depends on the past and <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/working-memory-and-creativity">current things in the mind</a>. In the case of design, city experience -- visual, traveling, talking, living -- is far more useful than books.
 
 Another reason to read is for the subjective experience of others. I usually don't enjoy getting experience this way and prefer simply talking to others, or watching a film, but that may be a fault of mine, as anything could be in another's mind. It is however interesting in the form of factual biographies, so that I can try to rationalize the subject's actions, especially a more romantic, nomadic person's life.
 
 Yet another reason is to read is to gain knowledge (does it count as experience?) in the form of facts from newspapers, or better, primary sources, to understand the world through the medium of language i.e. the life of Noam Chomsky. I never read newspapers, for the same reason, I prefer city, travel, and creative experiences: they provide infinitely more data and hopefully knowledge.
 
 Just another thought on this: A reason not to read is that it puts human language into working memory, as opposed to the infinite data of the working memory of experiences. One can experience a city in a day and have a better understanding of it than an infinite amount of books could provide. Focusing on language limits creativity to language. Instead of thinking in terms of space, time, material, and social life, one is reduced to thinking about language, and not thinking about the infinite data behind the language. One must continually experience as much life as possible to understand another's communication <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deconstruction">to a greater extent</a> in order to reap the benefits.

 Hmmm, I'm guessing I was feeling a bit pooped when I wrote this, saw a video of you, which reminded me of you, and felt like talking it out:
 
 I grew up in suburban America, then lived nomadically since college, including some great cities, including NY, and abroad. I think during my entire life (28 now) there is a bit of of me that cringes at the decisions that people make, including myself, under a capitalistic society (especially compounded with America's culture) that has made me unable to really fully participate in society, the modern city society.
 
 Perhaps the education began with biking very far as a child and watching foreign neorealism films on Netflix in high school, then feeling guilty over more things one becomes aware of, from having belongings manufactured from Asia to using a car in the suburbs -- Heck, I still feel restricted whenever I go back to the suburbs!
 
 Maybe the guilt kind of compounds until one is left eating oatmeal, camping, vagabonding, living in the third Chinatown of a city, or just moving to Taiwan or a similar pacific island, where a more stoic, ecologically-mindful, less-capitalism-influenced culture exists. Surely there is something irrational in my logic here?
 
 Oh, by participating in society, I don't just mean interacting at a for-profit social space -- cafe, club, bar, consumerism, bourgeoisie --...well maybe that's still part of it.
 
 Even last year when I tried a graduate program in design and technology with quite serious intentions at a good design school, I was quite disgusted to be forced to participate in a design jam for an advertisement for a beverage company in the first week, and also at their new building they spent a fortune on. Contradictorily, Jane Jacobs wrote her urban planning book there! It took a very frustrating week to learn that x% of time in design schools goes into advanced advertisement training. It also all felt strangely insular, partly because I had come back to America after a year of travel.
 
 Ah, that was one of the points! David Harvey, a kind of Marxist geographer, mentions urbanization as the absorption of surplus capital (see the Marxism yet?), or something like that. Kind of important in two ways: Socially, because it gentrifies the downtown area with a conforming class that holds power, has an exclusive private and public sphere, and makes social movements in important places more difficult to spatially organize, etc.; Economically...well maybe can skip that part. Hmmm. Hold on to this thought for a paragraph.
 
 My early interests were technology-related -- games, new media, -- and their intersection with art, education, and social organization. The first problem was being pidgeonholed as a computer programmer in any social environment. The second problem was being pidgeonholed as a white collar worker. This may have lead to my avoidance of technology for some time, teaching, farming, tramping, occasionally helping friends with their art games remotely.
 
 <strong>When one desires to be a part of society, which now means physically living in a city and having relationships and conversations with people in it, and/or desires to create and design things but does not want to participate in much capitalism, urbanization or production of commodity, it creates a conflict.</strong>
 
 Ah yes, I think that's it!
 
 <strong>I want to live in the city but I don't want to participate in the many things that happen in capitalism</strong>. It's a bit different from not wanting to work. I don't mind farming or cooking or babysitting or fixing things or programming or anything really with some good people outside the city. Inside the city the jobs and people are a bit more tainted, which eventually makes me sick of it (my case for SF, NY, even Taipei). There's hope and brilliant minds in place-based communities (inclusive, free, etc.), which where I spend most of my time and effort when I am in a city, but it's a bit harder to pitch a tent in the city, holding up whatever these values are, so I eventually and inevitably have to do some tainted work. There aren't many ears for more rational-technology things like the things from MIT Media Lab's Civic Center, which itself may have already disappeared. Or perhaps there are, but they are deep in some institution, and the institution itself can only hear a single paradigm.
 
 I will probably opt to go to New Zealand or Australia to do farm work for high wage and travel. I hope to try another go at my city-civic-tech-urban-planning-critical-theory-politic endeavors in Taipei, but I wonder how you've managed for so long.
 
 Well, you do have a good community and financial support.

 [todo: incomplete and very important to complete]
 
 Yesterday's post, <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/why-did-i-read">Why did I Read?</a>, was a good question.
 
 Yesterday night, I read about half of Fragments of an Anarchist Anthropology by David Graeber. It was reinvigorating. Why? Because it discarded much of modern reality, global capitalism. It talks of a society that exists outside of that infinitely complex system. And just outside of it, lies fresh air.
 
 I've lived in cities for quite some time. When one lives in a city, capitalism pervades, even if one ignores money. It exists in the behavior of people and in the material of the urban environment.
 
 If one is somewhat creative, then one likely has the a criticism of capitalism in one's mind.
 <blockquote>
 The desire for socio-political change may take creative forms, which simply depends on the past and current things in the mind. In the case of design, city experience — visual, traveling, talking, living — is far more useful than books.</blockquote>
 
 <strong>When I live in a city, I tend go in directions all which are opposite of capitalism. The desired end of my creation is the to alter the behavior of people to act more natural</strong>. Examples of past means are: creating critical media -- fine art, game, film, etc. --, creating a public space [place-based community] with DIY or anarchistic values, creating tools to aid the generation of healthy communities and neighborhoods, creating tools to limit conspicuous urbanization, and creating tools to direct people toward making positive and urban impacts.
 
 <strong>When I live outside of a city, I try to philosophize it -- understand it all</strong>. This lead to <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/why-did-i-read">the reason I read</a>:
 
 <blockquote>
 The reason I began reading is because I wanted to talk about things that I experience in the world, from epistemology to the culture I’ve lived in and back.</blockquote>
 
 <strong>I wanted to understand the city, and how social and political changes occur in it, so that I help could make those changes</strong>. But to understand it, one must understand human minds, politics, and, of course, capital.
 
 This lead to my interest in critical theory, which covers everything, though in a very messy and outdated way, urban planning, urbanization, decision-making, action, and much continental philosophy.
 
 Trying to philosophizing the entire thing is useless, but the random readings helped elaborate possible directions [, much like Graeber does in Fragments]. It was the organization of 27 years of life experience. The directions that came out, were quite good, they were similar to MIT Center of Civic Media, and many went beyond it.
 
 But as I didn't have the wealth to do these things, I had to write for grants or and apply for graduate school. I also had to plan how to get some money. And in the process, I had more house time, and kept reading.
 
 Somewhere during my reading of David Harvey's "Right to the City" <strong>I realized that much of capitalism's problems don't apply to me</strong>.
 
 The problems mentioned in Harvey's essay are the privatization of food, housing, healthcare, neoliberalism, and in the case of the US, nearly everything. Harvey's solution is to socialize, or better, uncommodify it all. It's a kind of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communization">communization</a>.
 
 But I live like a bum, keep my belongings in a backpack, sleep at friends' places, use Taiwan's excellent and low-cost healthcare, and work part-time jobs for capital. The jobs are my only hard connections to capitalism, as I sometimes need the capital to sustain, especially when the gift economy fails or when I just want to take a lone path in exploring (meaning not many social contacts for gift exchanges) away from institutions and society.
 <strong>
 So why bother with the capitalistic city?</strong> Why not just live on my own, or within a public space community in a city or a smaller community outside of it? Why not proceed in the direction that I desire, which is near parallel to the anarchistic directions sketched out by Graeber?
 
 <strong>Because I lived in the city. I deeply care(d?) about the people in it. My friends, the people on my street, the people in my neighborhood, in my city, in my country. The point of all my work in the city and out of it is to help those people live better lives.</strong>
 
 <strong>It just happens that they live under a capitalistic society.</strong>
 
 So, what now? It is my responsibility to reverse capitalism? Should I remove them from the place they love too? Or is it okay to ignore those people and live in a separate society (the physical space may not matter that much, though rent is a difficult obstacle) like so many indigenous societies do?
 
 These past few weeks I've also been reminded of the film <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/only-yesterday">Omoide Poro Poro</a> (Only Yesterday, おもひでぽろぽろ), where the main character, after living in the city for her entire life decides to move to a rural area, to live.
 
 [todo: stopped writing that night, publishing now, though incomplete, it's a very important self-assessment. The thought started because Fragments reminded me that I didn't need to live (and worry) under capitalism. I could live in a more anarchic way.] 5211 2015-12-05 06:56:53 2015-12-05 11:56:53 open closed free-from-capitalism publish 0 0 post 0 Community Critical Theory Ethics Humanities Life Personal Philosophy Political Philosophy Rationality Self-assessment Thoughts _edit_last 1 Awareness and Communication http://rahilpatel.com/blog/awareness-and-communication Sat, 05 Dec 2015 13:59:21 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=5248 This is part of a <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/valuable-things-ive-written#criticism_capitalism_communication_rationality">series of thoughts that are thematically bounded by a criticism of capitalism, communication, and rationality</a>.
 
 1. The mind has a bias toward what to be aware of.
 
 2. The mind has a bias toward which medium of communication to be aware of. If has been talking recently, then the sense of hearing speech is more aware. If one has been recently reading, then text is more apparent. If one has been watching films, then visuals are more apparent. If one has been traveling, then one is aware of everything, and must actively choose what to be aware of.
 
 3. Because the mind has a bias toward which medium to be aware of, one's mind may tend to organize communication into that medium. If one has been talking, one may feel like talking. If one has been reading, one may feel like writing. If one has been watching films, one may want to create more visual-oriented films. If one has been traveling, then one may choose a medium or create a medium to communicate in.

 When one infuses messages into a medium, it does count as communication until someone else extracts the messages.
 
 The time between the extraction of messages and responding to them is response time.
 
 The faster the extraction of messages, the faster one gains information.
 
 If the person does not understand the message, then the person must use other sources (people or mediums) to communicate to in order to understand the message.
 
 The person's understanding is the completion of the one-way communication.
 
 In the case of a social situation:
 The faster the two can respond, the faster the person will understand the meaning of the message.
 
 Once the meaning is understood, the person can create a new message for further communication (an action itself).
 
 Once the communication ends, there are three possibilities:... [todo: stopped here]
 
 social action:
 Often, the reason one creates messages is to have one's rationality validated or, in the case of more than one person, come to a consensus. Once validated, one is able to proceed with a social action.
 
 cities [urban areas] and social action:
 Because cities have such high density (people / social and material / urban), communication often takes place in the same space, allow communication through body language, oral language, urban art, in addition to non-space-based mediums (e.g. listening to radio, talking through instant messaging), often simultaneously.
 
 Because people are able to respond faster, understand meaning, continue communication, get validation of rational or come to a consensus, people are able to act faster.
 
 [Hmm, I was trying to extract some tacit knowledge of why consensual social action is more frequent in cities than outside of them. I wasn't able quite to do it. I often use the internet to communicate, not to another person in the same social time, reading several sources, to validate my actions. Actually, I often privilege the internet over many people as a source of validation.] 5268 2015-12-05 12:20:33 2015-12-05 17:20:33 open closed communication-social-action-and-cities publish 0 0 post 0 Action Aesthetics Communication Critical Theory Ethics Humanities Philosophy Rationality Urban Philosophy _edit_last 1 _wp_old_slug communication-and-reality Criticism of Innovative Urban Areas http://rahilpatel.com/blog/criticism-of-innovative-urban-areas Sat, 05 Dec 2015 20:00:35 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=5282 This is part of a <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/valuable-things-ive-written#criticism_capitalism_communication_rationality">series of thoughts that are thematically bounded by a criticism of capitalism, communication, and rationality</a>.
 
 [todo: almost complete?]
 
 In the last post, I was trying to figure out "why consensual social action is more frequent in cities than outside of them". Keeping that in mind, this third thought has a more skeptical view of cities. These two thoughts together hark much of yesterday's thought, <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/free-from-capitalism">Free from Capitalism</a>.
 
 Let's start with the project summary for Measuring Urban Innovation by MIT Media Lab's Changing Places research group:
 
 <blockquote>Cities are hubs for innovation, characterized by densely populated areas where people and firms cluster together, share resources, and collaborate. In turn, dense cities show higher rates of economic growth and viability. Yet, the specific places innovation occurs in urban areas, and what the socioeconomic conditions are that encourage it, are still elusive for both researches and policymakers. Understanding the social and spatial settings that enable innovation to accrue will equip policymakers and developers with the metrics to promote and sustain innovation in cities. This research will measure the attributes of innovation districts across the US in terms of their land-use configurations and population characteristics and behaviors. These measurements will be used to identify the factors that enable innovation, with the goal of developing a methodological approach for producing quantitative planning guidelines to support decision-making processes.
 <cite><a href="https://www.media.mit.edu/research/groups/changing-places">MIT Media Lab's Changing Places research group</a>, project summary for Measuring Urban Innovation</cite>
 </blockquote>
 
 Could there be a better definition for instrumental rationality than this?
 
 <blockquote>Instrumental rationality is a mode of thought and action that identifies problems and works directly towards their solution.
 ...
 Instrumental rationality is often seen as a specific form of rationality focusing on the most efficient or cost-effective means to achieve a specific end, but not in itself reflecting on the value of that end.
 <cite><em>Wikipedia</em>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumental_rationality">Instrumental Rationality</a></cite>
 </blockquote>
 
 There is within me a desire to live in a vibrant neighborhood community, but is the "hub for innovation" utopia or is it the hub for rational instrumentality? 
 
 What is the value of that end? Something merely based on "rates of economic growth and viability"? Some quantitative fiction that overlooks the human condition?
 
 It seems their utopia is <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/silicon-valley-and-capitalism">Silicon Valley</a>, as opposed to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Country_Index">a country with a good culture</a>.
 
 Although in a "hub for innovation" there are more successful validations of a person's rationality or social consensuses, and subsequently actions, <strong>there is a problem in the validation process: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_pragmatics#Communicative_action">rationality is validated because the economic and social systems said it was okay</a>. The validation didn't involve an active argumentation.</strong>
 
 This actually almost answers the question of the last post -- "why consensual social action is more frequent in cities than outside of them". <strong>Cities have a higher frequency of validated or consensual social actions because the economic system is more concentrated there. The drive of capitalism is stronger</strong>: competition creates a viscous work cycle, the privatization of basic human necessities forces one to at least work enough to pay for them, and, most notably, property rent is or will become the highest in the 'innovation hub'. The property rent is so high that one almost <em>must</em>, as opposed to <em>decide</em> to, innovate in order to maintain basic human needs. <strong>All of these factors limit the social time required to make a social consensus through argumentation, instead, forced to make decisions based on the rational of the economic system: capitalism.</strong>
 
 Which leads to another question. What is considered innovative?
 
 [todo: to be continued? I was thinking how innovative is often limited to scientific application / instrumental rationality, as opposed to the infinitude of creative acts conducted by all societies.
 
 Also, this entire post excludes problems of exclusion.] 5282 2015-12-05 15:00:35 2015-12-05 20:00:35 open closed criticism-of-innovative-urban-areas publish 0 0 post 0 Action Communication Critical Theory Ethics Humanities Philosophy Philosophy of Social Science Rationality Urban Philosophy _edit_last 1 _yoast_wpseo_primary_category Communication and Rationality http://rahilpatel.com/blog/communication-and-rationality Mon, 07 Dec 2015 00:30:42 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=5349 This is part of a <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/valuable-things-ive-written#criticism_capitalism_communication_rationality">series of thoughts that are thematically bounded by a criticism of capitalism, communication, and rationality</a>.
 
 [todo: THIS IS A DRAFT...What was initially a small post against communicative action or rationality turned into something too large: It seems to turn into the rationalization of a lot of my older ideas of how people act in reality without human language, prioritization of nonverbal communication over spoken and written language, why one should prioritize reality, academia's priority of language as a means of communication, why I didn't read a book until age 27, my education via films, why academia is irrational because of this (not including irks of capitalism, paradigms, and other problems), etc. I should remove the larger epistemology part and simply argue using tacit knowledge vs language as a source of knowledge, and enough reason to act. Though I'm trying to avoid the old critique of instrumental rationality, it may inevitably come up.

 From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communicative_action">Wikipedia</a>:
 <blockquote>Communicative action is cooperative action undertaken by individuals based upon mutual deliberation and argumentation.
 ...
 Communicative action for Habermas is possible given human capacity for rationality.</blockquote>
 ...or was is communicative rationality that I was thinking of?
 
 <blockquote>Communicative rationality, or communicative reason, is a theory or set of theories which describes human rationality as a necessary outcome of successful communication.
 
 According to the theory of communicative rationality, the potential for certain kinds of reason is inherent in communication itself. Building from this, Habermas has tried to formalize that potential in explicit terms. According to Habermas, the phenomena that need to be accounted for by the theory are the "intuitively mastered rules for reaching an understanding and conducting argumentation", possessed by subjects who are capable of speech and action. The goal is to transform this implicit "know-how" into explicit "know-that", i.e. knowledge, about how we conduct ourselves in the realm of "moral-practical" reasoning.</blockquote>
 
 [I wanted to argue against the requirement of argumentation to take a rational action, but I just noticed communicative action is cooperative, not of an individual...Anyway, I was going to say that people base their actions on tacit knowledge, not explicit knowledge, which is what language is made of. One could hypothetically learn and rationally act without ever using a written or spoken language (Is language required in order to have a longer thought in order to learn?). An example of rational action without language: the way that kids know something is wrong in a social situation and respond rationally. Then I was gong to tie that into how people naturally self-organize without much mutual deliberation (maybe I was getting at nonverbal language here?). This post is kind of a continuation of an older post: <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/no-more-writing">no more writing</a>. Posting this for now, as it follows the <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/criticism-of-innovative-urban-areas">last post</a>, which mentioned instrumental action.]
 
 from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Herbert_Mead#Social_philosophy_.28behaviorism.29
 <blockquote>Human activity is, in a pragmatic sense, the criterion of truth, and through human activity meaning is made. Joint activity, including communicative activity, is the means through which our sense of self is constituted. The essence of Mead's social behaviorism is that mind is not a substance located in some transcendent realm, nor is it merely a series of events that takes place within the human physiological structure. This approach opposed the traditional view of the mind as separate from the body. The emergence of mind is contingent upon interaction between the human organism and its social environment; it is through participation in the social act of communication that individuals realize their potential for significantly symbolic behavior, that is, thought. Mind, in Mead’s terms, is the individualized focus of the communication process. It is linguistic behavior on the part of the individual. There is, then, no “mind or thought without language;” and language (the content of mind) “is only a development and product of social interaction” (Mind, Self and Society 191-192). Thus, mind is not reducible to the neurophysiology of the organic individual, but is emergent in “the dynamic, ongoing social process” that constitutes human experience (Mind, Self and Society 7).</blockquote> 5349 2015-12-06 19:30:42 2015-12-07 00:30:42 open closed communication-and-rationality publish 0 0 post 0 Communication Critical Theory Humanities Philosophy of Social Science Rationality Social Philosophy _edit_last 1 _wp_old_slug communicative-action-and-rationality Rick Roderick's lecture on Habermas http://rahilpatel.com/blog/rick-rodericks-lecture-on-habermas Tue, 08 Dec 2015 08:56:10 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=5369 [todo: just posting the full notes, asterisks are worth thinking about

 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itGtf3ZSkyQ">Habermas - The Fragile Dignity of Humanity</a>
 defends rationality at a time where humans did and thought of irrational things
 instrumental, productive, labor, monological vs communication, dialogic
 science, technology vs humanities, ethics
 form ourselves in both dimensions, but cannot be subjective selves without communication
 - this idea rejects empiricism such as Hume and Skinner
 - correlates with Mead
 - to Roderick this is obvious, and comments that “you’d be surprised that it isn’t obvious in philosophy”.
 - [this I agree with, and why much of philosophy is indeed useless]
 third interest - critical interest, human emancipation, human liberation from unnecessary constraints from freedom and full development
 - free ourselves from productive and communicative reason [?]
 the way philosophers in the humanities is free themselves is through hermeneutics — the interpretation of text, or simply, read books
 systematically distorted communication [a term within lifeworld concept] or in Marxism, ideology [more specifically, cultural hegemony] — in every age the ruling ideas are of the ruling classes, and furthermore, spread by controlling the means of communication [manufacturing consent]
 should always suspect beliefs because of cultural hegemony
 interpretation for Habermas is not practical, it’s interpretive*
 Habermas feels we have an interest in removing the distortions in communication***
 in the negation: what would undistorted communication look like? Roderick answers with what I thought when asked the question: things other than just labor, but race, sex, class, colonialism, and so on*
 communicative rationality
 wants to disentangle enlightened action and barbaric actions including capitalism*
 - he mentions of a thought of a previous class, where the enlightenment thinking of science did not lead to enlightened actions, it lead to fascism. He says Adorno said that there’s no history where slavery lead to freedom, but there is history where the slingshot lead to the megaton bomb.
 - The sentences we utter, even at an early age, have in them the desire for consensus, mutual understanding**
 - it has already has an critical impulse in it, the desire to have undistorted clear communication
 quality provision**
 undistorted communication would have a symmetry condition like this: everyone would have an equal opportunity to talk and listen*
 - it has a political part to it: everyone has an equal right to command or obey, answer or question. It’s egalitarian; or, it’s distorted by the distribution of unequal power. He mentions teacher-student, parent-children, male-female
 - based on the Socrates ideal, interlocuting, and which is why Socrates is charming — he has no power
 - Habermas says the only force is only that everyone recognizes, which is a peculiar, strange, unforced force***
 - Habermas believes that much in rationality. That we can change our minds if we hear a better argument. And a free person can do that without feeling ashamed. So, at the end of the argument one could change their beliefs, not through distortion, but that strange force when one person becomes convinced.
 - conditions: try to be truthful, try to be relevant, try to be sincere, try to advance the cause of right — a moral condition, try to communicate ideally thought knowing it is impossible
 - for Habermas, these represent different practical areas, spheres — science, morality, art, religion. In different spheres, each condition will have more importance. In science, truth. In morality, rightness and good behavior. In art, sincerity? Rick isn’t sure about the art part. Rick says reminds us that this is a German theory and everything needs to fit.
 So by removing Marx, we remove economy. Which is difficult to tell coal miners in Virginia. Removing it kind of removes ourselves.*** And traded class struggle for Frued’s talking cure. Rick refutes this because worker’s bosses are different from analysts, they’re likely to use distorted communication. Even psychoanalysts may say, “if you don’t get paid, you won’t get better”.
 The problems with Habermas’s theory, which critics mention, is that it is elitist. That it replaces the factory with the seminar. All of the conditions in which undistorted communication takes place is in a seminar, a university, which is where Habermas spent his entire life.****
 - Habermas responds movingly, because communicative rationality applies to everyone, including workers, so the critics missed it’s universality. He says that in a process of enlightenment, there can only be participants. No analyst-patient model. It’s participatory.*** In this way, Rick comments happily, that it now looks like a linguistic theory of anarchism, and he likes it.**
 - Hermeneutic people also critiqued Habermas because it limits it to a single interest [didn’t quite understand]; They argue anything can be interpreted, including science.
 Interpretation is perhaps the way to achieve selfhood. Everyone is an interpreter. For example a red stop sign. Red is communist for Rick, but also stop. It goes on all around us all of the time, in all conversations and in our experience with the world.*** Especially in human relations. It just shows the ubiquity of interpretation in human life. We’re interpretive beings. It’s a part of being a self [the title of the lecture series]. And now, in the late 20th century, we are now in a situation where interpretation has never been more difficult,**** he references his Human Values lecture.
 
 One artifact that is completely closed to interpretation is television [one-way communication]. Rick says Orwell’s 1984 is optimist, which is an image of a boot on a human face. It’s optimist because he assumes there will be resistance and humans faces, both of which may turn out to be false.
 
 The tribute Rick wanted to pay to Habermas, and what interested him, was to try to defend reason, against cynical reason. It says to us, we can have reason, enlightenment, learn to say what is true. Although in his early work he doesn’t mention that this is endangered[,being wholly optimistic], he does mention it in his later work. In Theory of Communicative Reason, he comes back to defend it, adding more problems to it. Habermas addresses problems, some of what Rick mentioned already, but Habermas, in typical German fashion, waits to write a 4000 page book, lolol. In Rick’s book he does it in 31 pages. Habermas realizes that money and power as abstract systems distorts communication, and everyday talk. And those systems have to be harmonized to be within a system in which it will really be possible to speak to one another face-to-face. And hating to be quasi-theological: perhaps if we can do that, then we wouldn’t see through a glass darkly, and maybe have a way to find our way out of this dilemma, of the terrible entwinement of enlightenment and barbarism. Habermas is one voice that tells us that such a possibility exists, and for that Rick feels he deserves a lot of credit. That’s Habermas in a nutshell. 5369 2015-12-08 03:56:10 2015-12-08 08:56:10 open closed rick-rodericks-lecture-on-habermas publish 0 0 post 0 Civics Communication Critical Theory Humanities Media Philosophy Political Philosophy Rationality Social Philosophy _edit_last 1 An interview with Rick Roderick about critical theory http://rahilpatel.com/blog/an-interview-with-rick-roderick-about-critical-theory Tue, 08 Dec 2015 08:54:28 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=5371 [todo: just posting the full notes, asterisks are worth thinking about]
 
 https://www.partiallyexaminedlife.com/2013/02/04/rick-roderick-and-the-self-under-siege/
 
 Texas is neither Left or Right, but has a bit of solidarity.
 
 read Notes from the Underground by Dostkevsky at age 15, he thinks because he just wanted to talk, perhaps understand why the culture he lived in was so
 
 parents were quite outsiders, father a conman, a mother a beautician, neither a Christian
 born in a poor rural white area
 
 went to philosophy because of the time he lived in, the 60’s, getting friends in body bags from the Vietnam War, political assassinations, and so oh. He just wanted to understand, and philosophy is just one of the ways. It was driven by passion and horror around him. Through it he began to see the structures around him falling apart, the hidden past of the Americas, when he listened to Woody Gutherie, which came after Bob Dylan, a past full of promise which basically been taken over by technowar and beauracrats, and certainly systematically hidden at the university.
 
 he said he loves americas, and that’s the odd part, to love America but feel alienated from many things
 
 John Stockwell reminds us that America has fought 200 wars in 200 years, it’s committed genocide against [Native] Indians, Africans, and killed mass millions of people
 
 It’s highly ambiguous
 
 Started study with communications, because he was involved with anti-war activities, and there he could simply watch films and write papers on it [in other words, it was practical].** He wanted it to take as little time as possible.** And on the side he took philosophy courses. It was later that he took philosophy systematically, in the late 60s, and more serious in the mid-70s after the counter-revolution, to study what happened. And also, he needed to find a way to eat, which is an imperative of capitalism that has placed upon us.** As Hunter S. Thompson says, “When the coming gets weird, the weird becomes the pro”. So he decided to become a progressional philosopher. He says he tried not to get schooling in the way of his education, as said by Mark Twain.** He then says he learned a lot by meeting people outside the university. Many kinds of people, avant-garde artist types, Bergman film festivals, anti-war activists. All of it seeking an alternative future.
 
 Why critical theory? The first thing was attending a lecture by Herbert Marcuse. He felt Marcuse brought together Marx and Freud with appreciation with American culture. It should be more well known that Bob Dylan was Marcuse’s favorite artist. Marcuse combined many things in Roderick’s life. It was only after that, that Roderick began to systematically study critical theory, as a way of coming over the isolation of disciplines** within universities and a point of struggle within the system, as well as making up links to social movements, which came through Lukacs and Korsch, which was of a course subsequent to a long study of Marx.
 
 What do you think is essential to critical theory? To Rick, it’s represents what Horkheimer calls systematic unfolding of a single existential value judgement concerning the crisis within the capitalist system.***** Beginning with that judgement, it represents an unfolding of it, as we trace domination, reification, sexism, racism, dehumanization, as it spreads through the society, without restricting any boundaries, using all media seriously, and consider the fragmentation of college society as a remnant of bourgeoisie society. This eliminates a canon of works, which is listless, sexist, and racist itself. So it’s clear that the sum of wisdom couldn’t be known by eleven fat old white guys. Critical theory helps us make connections to see why that’s the case,*** and understand philosophy in that border sense, and use it to come together,** for people interested in real alternatives.
 
 This is an idealist interpretation. Certainly, it’s an idealist interpretation that breaks decisively with Adorno’s pessimism. Rick says he finds Adorno’s pessimism terribly attractive and so he must react to it violently, and is willing to see the contradiction in himself. Says that the Adorno dialectical enlightenment is the most seductive brilliant intellectual figures of the 20th century. And Rick’s only response to Adorno’s thought that if we take this seriously, then there is no hope, is simply Bloch’s response, that reason and humanity cannot flourish without hope. This is a practical postulate of action, not a theory, so this response comes from that level [?]. The duality occurs in many people’s works, but Rick’s response is to never give up, because that becomes a self-fulfilling form of behavior. The job of a social critic is to paralyze us, as it does in Fuccoult’s prison, Thompson’s exterminism, and Adorno in a highly sophisticated form to the extent he succeeds in doing that, because that’s the critics job, but Adorno contradictorily loses, by paralyzing us for action. This response isn’t theoretical, it’s activist [?].
 
 This may have taken us to the edge of critical theory, but this is what lead to me Habermas. Because Habermas was looking for response to the dialectic of enlightenment, to the world of nuclear weapons, instrumental reason, and the disappearance of the bourgeoisie subject, what we used to call people [hmm, bourgeoisie in a good sense here? Public sphere?].
 
 You wrote your dissertation on Habermas, didn’t you? One reason was because many Leftists were going to Habermas as a source for sustenance and academic careers, an academic cottage industry. So his book was a dialectical critique of Habermas, where he gives an attempt to give a positive notion of returning to critical theory of the 30’s to try to recover moments of for him [Habermas] reason for me [Rick] revolt. He wanted to critique him so that we wouldn’t take Habermas’s analysis for America, which is quite different from West Germany at the time Habermas wrote things. He also wanted to warn people against reading Habermas as an obvious theoretical outcome which is better represented by Marcuse, Bloch, and Benjamin.**** For an American audience, without question. Habermas is defending reason where German historians are saying, forget Auschwitz, we fought the French, we’re with NATO, and he has to respond to people who think in this way.** So naturally he starts with moderate concepts such as consensus. Liberalism in the Julian sense. Rick feels but that’s just the beginning.
 
 How a globalizing approach to things, such as Habermas and the Frankfurt school could be digestible, in a philosophic environment such as pragmatism such as America? In one sense Rick doesn’t want it to be understandable, believing in Hegel’s sense of totality, of literally understanding everything about everything is an illusion, which is dangerous politically. Trying to get a sense of everything, the world, is something the Right was good at. Mentions Oliver North’s narrow world view. So there’s a level to understand the large picture, without trying to make a grand theory that’s trying to shut out in an elitist way the moments of difference, of non-convergence.** So wants defends totality, without falling into older traps, which was beautifully criticized by Adorno and others. The only meaning that theory can have is the practical struggle of humans against it.*** Where that is absent, my theory is absent; Where that is present, my theory is present.*** Rick wants to know strategy that ultimately appeals to the finite struggle of humans to achieve real freedom, like free time and creativity, as opposed to “leisure time”, and in other parts basic things, like food, shelter. Before we can have what no human beings have ever had, which is real freedom, we need to have at least what ever human being should have, which is food, shelter, free baseball games.*****
 
 This is all fine if we accept a materialist meaning of freedom. Suppose I [interviewer] say the biggest need is for contemplation, reflection. Would your critical theory have a space for me? This is where Marxism become implicated with it’s enemy, in a way capitalism disguises the world and says that all needs are economic, and that we as it’s enemies go agree. That’s just false. So to listen to non-inquisitive things like India, women, etc. If critical theory doesn’t have a place for this, Rick would rather throw the theory, than these other things. Whether if this can be done theoretically consistently, is not of importance. Rick takes the deductive consistency both politically and sexually unconscious.
 
 The early emancipatory parts in Frankfurt School, Marxism, and different parts of humans that have been silenced. Which leads to the final question: The interviewer learned that she shares the malaise, critique of structuralism of social action, which Marx and the Frankfurt school has always stood for. She thinks that Rick agrees to view the movements of France. Rick says he kind of has a love-hate relationship with France.** They do wonderful things like May ’68 (largest general strike in history of France, created re-election in three days, in which surprisingly, the ruling party gained even more seats). The first industrialized country brought to a revolution where nobody is killed, where they [opposition] is defeated by the totality of society, in the factory, in the streets, and in everyday life, for two months. The failure of it brings the response, absolute nihilism, well we tried it. [recollecting the Dialectic of Enlightenment] Rick says that as a history it shouldn’t be looked as a whole, complete, final; Things appear, disappear, then they come back in a fuller form, and so on*****. So I think that the fact that the expectations were so great then disappointed meant a lot of French theory take this local situation, as a universal negativity. That attitude is part of the conservative revolution of France, West German, and America. At the same time, there are peace movements, working-class movements, women’s movements. He feels the fact that labor unions losing members is a positive thing, because Americans don’t see themselves as purely represented on economic terms by purely beauracrats. We don’t just take one beautiful expression of revolutionary history and say well, that’s it. Rick doesn’t want to draw the positive or negative universalist thesis from a local experience [going back to comparing the Frankfurt’s School of thought at their time in France to America, it’s a failure in anthropology].
 
 What advice would you give us to help us mold our practice for such human emancipation? We should be more critical. Why does the humanities de-humanize us? Why when I get a degree in the humanities I feel less human than I started? Why are all of my humanities teacher’s actually nihilists? Start with basic critical questions: Students should ask, why in the hell are we reading these? What good are these books? My advice, not that I’m telling them what to do, they can do whatever they want to, find their own forms of struggle. The beginning is to realize the poverty of student life. That you are unpaid worker, actually you are paying to work, and are working in an atmosphere of a university that is poverty-stricken experience. Simple by being more critical of the system.
 
 And teachers? This is more difficult because teachers are placed in authority, power, in a disciplinary structure.**** Part of the job is to normalize students. You’re the soft guy in this situation. The only way Rick has found a way to solve this paradox is by telling the students strike out all authority based on the authority Rick Roderick, that this is paradoxical, but there no reason to deny it. That you have a place for reasons. One reason that there has been a resurgence is because the bourgeoisie see a poverty of their own education, and it’s quite important for modern capital. Prove authenticity to students.
 
 You [from interviewer to Rick] are an exception of the theory to the university as prison. Rick responds by summarizing the last paragraph, end then agrees that there are few that share the idea of finding alternatives. There are many levels of struggle, because once capitalism takes the whole life, from marketing desires to consciousness, it’s latest stage, then struggle also involves the whole of life, from everyday life to politics. So Rick doesn’t want to limit these struggles, he wants them to flourish. He hopes the attitude spreads, because Raegan’s hegemony is de-legitimizing everything around us. 5371 2015-12-08 03:54:28 2015-12-08 08:54:28 open closed an-interview-with-rick-roderick-about-critical-theory publish 0 0 post 0 Critical Theory Humanities Social Philosophy _edit_last 1 _oembed_a35dc7feaee00963c27e4b1606e32fbd {{unknown}} The Distance between Communication and Reality http://rahilpatel.com/blog/the-distance-between-communication-and-reality Thu, 10 Dec 2015 18:07:08 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=5563 This is part of a <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/valuable-things-ive-written#criticism_capitalism_communication_rationality">series of thoughts that are thematically bounded by a criticism of capitalism, communication, and rationality</a>.
 
 Some thoughts from this morning, which seem to be a continuation of <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/why-did-i-read">Why did I read?</a>, probably because I'm physically leaving this abode I've been dwelling in far too long.
 
 The thoughts:
 1. The amount of sense data gathered from real experiences is infinitely larger than those gathered from communication.
 2. Therefore, it is impossible to communicate at the level that reality communicates.
 3. I may have began reading because I wanted to talk, but in the act of talking, it seems much of the content was lost. 
 [todo: maybe missing some thoughts]
 
 Thought 1:
 1. <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/forms-of-consumption-reality-and-media">The amount of sense data gathered from real experiences is infinitely larger than those gathered from communication</a>.
 2. Because of that <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/prose-is-superfluous-active-communication-through-play-and-art">I have always prioritized experience above communication.</a>
 [todo: could continue this thought]
 
 Thought 2:
 1. It is impossible to communicate at the level that reality communicates.
 2. Because of that, it is not a good idea to communicate isolated from reality, especially for a long period of time, in which memory can fade and awareness may likely focus on communication (often distorted) in the form of media as opposed to reality (direct cinema, observational cinema, and cinema verite may be exceptions).
 2.1. <strong>The distance between communication and reality is a reoccurring problem in decision-making: academia vs city, quantitative vs qualitative, instrumental rationality vs substantial rationality.</strong>
 3. Because of that (2), one must learn to balance real experiences (reality) and communication, though submitting to the fact that their communication will always be distorted.
 3.1 But is communication (perhaps an emphasis on media rather than everyday conversation) even needed (this was perhaps what I going to argue against in <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/communication-and-rationality">Communication and Rationality</a>)? Beyond hard sciences, should one believe anything that is communicated (may have some post about skepticism)?
 4. As the distance between communication and reality increases, the amount of distortion in communication increases.
 5. In order to maintain a less distorted reality, one must maximize the amount of social time of having an experience.
 5.1. In order to achieve a clearer communication, one must limit the communication to recent experiences.
 5.2 These also work in the other direction. In order to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deconstruction">picture reality while receiving communication</a>, one must have more experience with reality.

 This was taken from a thought from <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/the-distance-between-communication-and-reality">The Distance between Communication and Reality</a>, and is a direct of continuation of <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/why-did-i-read">Why Did I read?</a>
 
 I may have began reading because I wanted to talk, but in the act of talking, it seems much of the content has digressed. Instead of talking about my experiences of the difference of how people act within a capitalistic city and outside of it, the ideologies of countries, property, the effects that the distance between humans have, communities, ideal neighborhoods, and so on, the one-way communication of books, and even the seemingly interactive communication of Wikipedia, has led me astray. Perhaps philosophy was not the way to go. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzyDTV6EzUs">Philosophy is just one set of possible classifications</a>. <strong>Thinking back upon my time of reading, I feel only <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penguin_Great_Ideas">essayists</a> were able to grasp experience, simply by talking about it, in the similar way that documentarians grasp experiences, simply by documenting it. Everyone else was attempting the impossible: to organize reality</strong>.
 
 <blockquote>It is inevitable that life will be not just very short but very miserable for those who acquire by great toil what they must keep by greater toil. They achieve what they want laboriously; they possess what they have achieved anxiously; and meanwhile they take no account of time that will never more return. New preoccupations take the place of the old, hope excites more hope and ambition more ambition. They do not look for an end to their misery, but simply change the reason for it.
 - Seneca, <a href="https://archive.org/details/SenecaOnTheShortnessOfLife">On The Shortness Of Life</a></blockquote>
 
 Instead of simply documenting my travels, I attempted to understand my experiences with the world through philosophical theories. What was I supposed to do? Write a holistic travel-science tome like Humboldt? Perhaps that would have been faster. But even my huge repository of thoughts were about communication, culture, experience, decision-making, politics, all of which still are still categorized under philosophy, not science. Perhaps because I focused on those things even during more active times, it was okay to attempt to organize them later during low times. A note to my future: <strong>I must live more</strong>.
 
 Whether I live romantically, traveling the world with my legs, creating tools to live more romantically, or instrumentally, creating tools to increase self-education, self-organization, and self-maintenance, there must be more life in it. I am not sure how such disparate lifestyles can be balanced. Perhaps it is because one lifestyle tends to go in one direction, romanticism toward experience, instrumental toward organization, that it is so difficult to balance. <strong>If I were able to choose based on happiness, or which results in a consistent social life, it would be instrumental, but the urge for romantic exploration will inevitably come, and making those explorations social becomes the key</strong>. 
 
 <strong>During some of my most active times, I lived romantically and tried to <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/constant-art-ethics">record communication using the quickest means possible</a>; It was through the lifestyles of Vincent Moon, Brandon Stanton, Chris Marker, and local artists in New York that I could foresee a possible combination of romanticism and communication, and a possible way to live: They were the keys. They discovered methods to communicate while experiencing. They found a way to talk about what <em>they</em> wanted, not what <em>philosophers or society</em> wanted. They are contemporary essayists. The kind of people that talk about everything through almost anything, and in doing so, have fulfilling lives.</strong>
 
 But it's not every time that I feel like talking about anything. During most of my time philosophizing, I had desired social changes. <strong>This brings up another lifestyle: critically, to maximize social impact in the time and space I live in. The reason I read wasn't just about talking, it was about learning the problems of society and figuring out methods to make society better: finding directions, finding ideas, finding examples in other societies. There were practical ends. Creating socially realistic essays through mass communication was just one method to that practical end; They subverted mass media and offered something closer to contemporary reality that one could learn from. And in doing so, it made me happy, for the moment.</strong>
 
 It was a good method until I became disillusioned by the effects media have in contemporary society and therefore became dissatisfied with those projects. I thought it could change people's perception, and then their behavior. Maybe it could if I had continued as Brandon did, but I desired more direct methods to change people's behavior. My mind went to <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/category/art-2/new-media">more Bansky style art</a> in a public places, directly experienced and directly affecting people. Then my mind went toward <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/a-project-plan-for-an-urban-area">creating community hall-like social centers using technology as an aid</a>. I still desire to do both, perhaps all three methods, but I'm out of money, and I've been out of reality for too long, so I must experience life all over again, to recreate those political desires, and continue this endless cycle that is my life. 5618 2015-12-10 19:38:24 2015-12-11 00:38:24 open closed why-i-did-what-i-did publish 0 0 post 0 Art Communication Critical Theory Humanities Life Personal Philosophy Rationality _edit_last 1 Possible Next Moves http://rahilpatel.com/blog/possible-next-moves Fri, 11 Dec 2015 19:06:17 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=5668 Possible next moves:
 *. Secure a dwelling
 - Taiwan it too effing hot during the summer, and too rainy during the winter. Housing is terrible in cities. Hostels are usually enuogh, but even they often lack a kitchen, or a the ability to host events. This can't be skipped anymore.
 - 1. test out the tent
 -- Is a tent good enough? Probably! But then it's still missing electricity, wi-fi, ability to cook cheaply, ability to store cold things, and generally, regulate body temperature. Maybe the proximity of a / ability to have a cold shower (during the summer) is enough though? It's worth trying, to be closer to nature; to begin with nothing, only accumulating enough to survive, selecting everything for a minimal lifestyle. Rainy days may become even more depressing. Can easily move to another place! -- Think of that! Can simply move along the mountain or small towns, or even in people's farms or backyards.
 -- As for consistently meeting people, if I were to use a tent, then I would rely on a public place, which means I would have to rely on the politics of that place. Perhaps it should be a very public place -- a temple, public square, etc. as opposed to a closed space.
 - 2. hostel vs personal place
 -- a hostel provides amenities (hopfully has a kitchen!) and a stream of diverse people.
 -- A personal place can double as a public place enabling me to freely host events in it, invite people, etc. It also enables accumulation of assets (opposes shared amenities), which may further decrease cost-of-living (rice cooker, tea leaves and containers for storing tea, etc.). To make-up for the lack of diverse people, CouchSurfing, AirBnB, and event-making is almost required for a normative, physical social life.
 -- both are rather immobile, though if I keep it minimal, it may be easy to move around places.
 
 *. Make money. :(
 - x/1. try grants toward civics
 -- very limited for individuals. Maybe fit civil projects under an existing organization, then apply.
 -- long-term limit to movement, and therefore nomadic ideas
 - x/2. try scholarship for master's in urban planning in a school in an urban area to buy time
 -- apply in late December to March
 -- also limits movement long-term
 - <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/the-ideal-work">I wasted time with the above two</a>. Skip to abuse capitalism. Fuck people, politics, and their institutions.
 - 3. last resort: independently sell commodities (teach, rent, tea, crafts, short games, short films), as opposed to freelance design and programming, to buy time. Or, exploit capitalism and select more lucrative gigs (ghostwrite college applications for Asian students)
 -- selling Chai was successful, but limited by the town's social limits. Maybe can sell illegally in Taipei? Maybe hit up a freelance gig in a target city.
 - 4. give into the devil that is global capitalism and move to an affluent country and do social or labor work: farming in New Zealand and Australia (doubles as travel, can circle the islands via scooter), social work in New York or cities with sunny weather
 - 5. give into the devil of past and remotely work while having more meaningful work within my locality. Hopefully remotely work for tools for organizing, self-education, and civic technology
 
 1. Scooter or walk around Taiwan
 -- stop by civic organizations along the way
 -- write letters to organizations and people to incite action or take action
 -- focus actions toward impact, avoid non-practical fine art and philosophy
 -- try this with a tent at first. If that's too demanding, then maybe have to first secure a dwelling to begin with a healthy body, then try this again until I am fit enough.
 2. Create a social space, use hostel and street stall financial models for income. Create technology to the benefit of the people and their organizations.
 x/3. Build a house in nature for myself, with very cheap land rent, to distance self from society's problems. Use the experience to build minimalist shelters in the future (and maybe even <a title="Everything I Own" href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/everything-i-own">minimalist gear</a>).
 -- Past societies have done since time immemorial, maybe better to just use camping gear more often while traveling around Taiwan and other nearby countries.
 --- I think what I meant by the first line is: there is no point of using time for basic needs, when I could spend less time doing high-wage work, then spending the rest of the time toward my interests.
 -- It's possible to live a simple life anywhere, it just requires more discipline against the convenience of contemporary culture of larger cities. Maybe temporarily hiding out at nearby small town is enough. One adapts to live simply, eating grains and vitamin, and living ascetically.
 -- Still, the point of experiencing the feeling of being entirely self-sufficient in nature exists.
 -- A middle way may be to live on 蘭嶼 (Orchid Island) for a period of time, initially living simply with a tent, water filter, and grains, but progressing toward self-sufficiency.
 x/4. Teach in the most progressive and/or lenient environment.
 -- Maybe simply running periodic workshops from a public space is enough. Avoid teaching what global capitalism wants (English), brain drain into higher institutions, and exclusive progressive primary education. Education is free.
 -- I've become less interested since I've written this, favoring self-education through technology and exploration, likely because I've recently been hitting the e-books.
 -- Also, simply having a public space <em>is</em> providing an education, through an educational environment
 5. Learn everything there is about Taiwan by constantly traveling and talking to people. Also reading a history book or two about it. Could start Humans of Taiwan for this again, using it as a platform to create a reality for the nation. Could extend to nearby countries to compare.
 -- Could try recording performances like Vincent Moon, or documenting human problems like Foucault
 --- I don't think there's much to capture that hasn't been captured. It's more about my perspective, like Humans of Taiwan, or Chris Marker film essays. It's seeing the the world through my eyes, seeing cultural problems, what people do, and so on.
 *. Always travel. Friends in cities and universities. Personal selection of Silk Road from Yunnan to Netherlands to Ireland. Central and South America.
 *. Always think about design and technology, social organizing, civic engagement, and decision-making in general, to where it changes reality.
 *. Can think of film and games too? 5668 2015-12-11 14:06:17 2015-12-11 19:06:17 open closed possible-next-moves publish 0 0 post 0 Life Personal Self-assessment temp _edit_last 1 _yoast_wpseo_content_score 30 _yoast_wpseo_primary_category medium_post O:11:"Medium_Post":11:{s:16:"author_image_url";s:74:"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/200/200/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png";s:10:"author_url";s:28:"https://medium.com/@rahil627";s:11:"byline_name";N;s:12:"byline_email";N;s:10:"cross_link";s:2:"no";s:2:"id";s:12:"e65f6dcd097f";s:21:"follower_notification";s:3:"yes";s:7:"license";s:19:"all-rights-reserved";s:14:"publication_id";s:12:"7a04709b0155";s:6:"status";s:6:"public";s:3:"url";s:61:"https://medium.com/@rahil627/possible-next-moves-e65f6dcd097f";} I Can Almost See the Sun http://rahilpatel.com/blog/i-can-almost-see-the-sun Sat, 12 Dec 2015 00:06:17 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=5679 This is part of a <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/valuable-things-ive-written#criticism_capitalism_communication_rationality">series of thoughts that are thematically bounded by a criticism of capitalism, communication, and rationality</a>.
 
 This post contains three parts:
 
 <h2>The Sun</h2>
 Recommended listenings: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ws6yxpgnFqo&index=8&list=PLZHT74BLLuj0i-spPyn5vR5XDgj9SlP_x">"Sun in Your Eyes"</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ5B-U6LwaA">"Sun it Rises"</a>.
 
 I thought of the the sun, dreamed of hopping farms in New Zealand and Australia, checked the weather in southwest Taiwan. It is considerably warmer. Then I realized it.
 
 All of this time I've been communicating through written language because the <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/the-effects-of-weather">weather</a> in Yilan, Taiwan is rainy, and recently, cold. Over time, reading and writing in an isolated dwelling, I lost weight, became habituated to communicating through this medium, prioritizing it over finding and talking to people with similar values. I was unable to fight it, media was easier, my physical condition made it a grudge to commute to the city. It's the same experience I had at home. It stops me from acting, instead writing it down through ideals and directions.
 
 At first, in addition to my physical condition and habituation, I thought it was the lack of money and a lack of desire to follow what capitalism wants. Perhaps they may be factors too, but recently it dawned that an alternate reason, a simple anti-cure exists: a lack of sun. The sun is what powers me to wake up, go out, and socialize.
 
 The experience is very close now. I can almost see the sun. And the city.
 
 <h2>The Experience</h2>
 Excerpts from John Dewey, Art as Experience, end of chapter 1:
 <blockquote>For only when an organism shares in the ordered relations of its environment does it secure the stability essential to living</blockquote>
 <blockquote>The artist has his problems and thinks as he works. But his thought is more immediately embodied in the object. Because of the comparative remoteness of his end, the scientific worker operates with symbols, words and mathematical signs.
 
 The artist does his thinking in the very qualitative media he works in, and the terms lie so close to the object that he is producing that they merge directly into it</blockquote>
 This sounds like the <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/the-distance-between-communication-and-reality">distance between communication and rationality</a>. Here it's not just spatial distance, it's temporal. The artist "<a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/simultaneous-ethics">thinks as he works</a>".
 
 Dewey separates the two, artist and scientist. I feel the separation now too, I am definitely not a scientist.
 <blockquote>Direct experience comes from nature and man interacting with each other. In this interaction, human energy gathers, is released, dammed up, frustrated and victorious. There are rhythmic beats of want and fulfillment, pulses of doing and being withheld from doing.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>To overpass the limits that are set is destruction and death, out of which, however, new rhythms are built up.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>The proportionate interception of changes establishes an order that is spatially, not merely temporally patterned.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>Inner harmony is attained only when, by some means, terms are made with the environment.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>The time of consummation is also one of beginning anew. Any attempt to perpetuate beyond its term the enjoyment attending the time of fulfillment and harmony constitutes withdrawal from the world.
 ...
 Instead of trying to live upon whatever may have been achieved in the past, it uses past successes to inform the present.
 ...
 Only when the past ceases to trouble and anticipations of the future are not perturbing is a being wholly united with his environment and therefore fully alive.</blockquote>
 Sounds like <a href="https://archive.org/details/SenecaOnTheShortnessOfLife">Seneca</a> here, with regard to past, present and future.
 <blockquote>The live animal is fully present, all there, in all of its actions: in its wary glances, its sharp sniffings, its abrupt cocking of ears. All senses are equally on the qui vive. As you watch, you see motion merging into sense and sense into motion -- constituting that animal grace so hard for man to rival.
 ...
 His senses are sentinels of immediate thought and outposts of action, and not, as they so often are with us, mere pathways along which material is gathered to be stored away for a delayed and remote possibility.
 ...
 Experience in the degree in which it is experience is heightened vitality. Instead of signifying being shut up within one's own private feelings and sensations, it signifies active and alert commerce with the world; at its height it signifies complete interpenetration of self and the world of objects and events</blockquote>
 Yes! The feeling of acting upon sense, the savage instincts, it is quite the experience. Does that make it irrational? It depends. Isn't all one can do is to do one's best within social time and space? Why is goal-oriented behavior better [beyond economic productivity]?
 <blockquote>Because experience is the fulfillment of an organism in its struggles and achievements in a world of things, it is art in germ. Even in its rudimentary forms, it contains the promise of that delightful perception which is esthetic experience.</blockquote>
 Boom.
 
 Well, it's worth including in the series of posts. There's surely things about communication I've missed here; Furthermore, it seems Dewey <i>understands</i> the way "artists", or the artistic side of humans, communicate with the world. It's something I feel Habermas glances over. What that something is I haven't been able to explicate.
 
 <h2>The City</h2>
 Excerpts by Jane Jacobs, The Death and Life of Great American Cities, last chapter:
 <blockquote>City processes in real life are too complex to be routine, too particularized for application as abstractions. They are always made up of interactions among unique combinations of particulars, and there is no substitute for knowing the particulars.</blockquote>
 At first reading it sounded like hopelessness here, but upon rereading it seems to emphasize bottom-up thinking and relationships.
 <blockquote>In the life sciences, organized complexity is handled by identifying a specific factor or quantity—say an enzyme—and then painstakingly learning its intricate relationships and interconnections with other factors or quantities. All this is observed in terms of the behavior (not mere presence) of other specific (not generalized) factors or quantities. To be sure, the techniques of two-variable and disorganized-complexity analysis are used too, but only as subsidiary tactics.
 
 In principle, these are much the same tactics as those that have
 to be used to understand and to help cities. In the case of under-
 standing cities, I think the most important habits of thought are
 these:
 1. To think about processes;
 2. To work inductively, reasoning from particulars to the gen-
 eral, rather than the reverse;
 3. To seek for "unaverage" clues involving very small quan-
 tities? which reveal the way larger and more "average" quantities are operating.</blockquote>
 This sums up Jane's method of inquiry: process otology, inductive reasoning, and street knowledge (gladly, no word for this). The process ontology is the method of observing behaviors (processes) and its relations to specific factors.
 
 I've always been skeptical of anything beyond the third habit: street knowledge. Its not that I'm just skeptical of Jane's method of inquiry, rather, in my mind, it all fell under street knowledge; I didn't distinguish it.
 
 Of districts, main streets, individual shops, public placss, public spaces, neighborhoods, people, gentrification, de-gentrification, ethnic enclaves -- all of which have their own unique culture, the people individually, public transport, pedestrian and biking accessibility, and so on, is all magically inputed in the mind, and decisions come out. I don't think of the method of inquiry. I only think of the particulars and creating a particular application. Never further.
 
 Jane might be on to something, beyond spending half a book attacking quantitative thinkers, she's able to talk to those thinkers, "scientists" in Dewey's terms, she's able to communicate. Every city dweller has the intuition of her book, but she seems to be the first to explicate it, and in doing so, she created an important urban planning book.
 
 Instead of trying to create social movements, create technology to to enable people to make more political decisions, create anarchist spaces, create art which could convey the same messages in a much higher speed, she decided to talk to the scientists.
 
 It's strange that scientists can even talk. Perhaps the pertinent question is: <b>why scientists are unable to learn from experience as opposed to the symbols of communication from others?</b> Why did they fail to see this when they live in New York? Why did they fail to see it communicated through art? <b>Does a strong artist-scientist dichotomy really exist?</b>
 
 <b>I think the problem, perhaps missing from the book, is of culture and economy</b>, in this case, American culture and American capitalism. Why the developers (private and public) have surplus wealth in the first place, spend it hastily on urbanization -- likely pressured by capitalism, and the greater the city the greater the pressure, and what do they hope people will act like?; <b>Why their culture brought them up to think scientifically, even on non-science topics.</b> [todo: could continue this thought]
 
 <blockquote>The surplus wealth, the productivity, the close-grained juxtaposition of talents that permit society to support advances such as these [the example was disease control] are themselves products of our organization into cities, and especially into big and dense cities.</blockquote>
 
 I agree with the close position of talents communicating and acting, and the density factor of cites, <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/silicon-valley-and-capitalism">though less so in a an exclusive capitalistic culture</a>. I disagree on the fact they have to be big, and I don't think it's ideal either.
 
 <blockquote>It may be romantic to search for the salves of society's ills in slow-moving rustic surroundings, or among innocent, unspoiled provincials, if such exist, but it is a waste of time. Does anyone suppose that, in real life, answers to any of the great questions that worry us today are going to come out of homogeneous settlements?</blockquote>
 
 Hah, this is quite persuasive. I agree that nothing comes out of homogenous settlements, but I disagree that things cannot be learned from other kinds of human settlements and societies. Human settlements and societies are the real experiments, and what works in one place <em>could</em> work in another. I disagree again: All cities depend on it's rustic surroundings, and caring for them is a responsibility of the city, simply because they provide the sustenance. These areas do require more thinking, and one must be there to think about it. I disagree yet again: One can escape society's ill's by getting out of the society. <strong>When a city culture is so dominating and progress is too slow, outside of the city becomes a place with alternate possibilities</strong> (though, it's sometimes possible to create alternative space within the city or make social progress for the entire city): where artists go to create villages, anarchists go to create their own districts, and generally where people go to form new communities, which themselves are <strong>vital, just on a smaller scale</strong>.
 
 That leads to another point against big cities that Jacobs is missing: <strong>things don't come out of big cities, they come out of particular people in it, as mentioned before, "the close-grained juxtaposition of talents"</strong>. A big city is just has more groups of organized talents, a university is supposed to have a higher ratio of these, a small town could have just as many equal to a vibrant neighborhood, down to a single group, which is probably around 2-15 people. It's not the size, or even density in the case of China, <strong>it's about throwing diverse people together and giving them space to allow them to self-organize</strong>.
 
 <blockquote>Dull, inert cities, it is true, do contain the seeds of their own destruction and little else. But lively, diverse, intense cities contain the seeds of their own regeneration, with energy enough to carry over for problems and needs outside themselves.</blockquote>
 
 New York is constantly devouring capital by constantly gentrifying itself. It regenerates at the cost of the world's labor. In the act of caring for her city, a city I love too, Jane ensues blind optimism for it. 5679 2015-12-11 19:06:17 2015-12-12 00:06:17 open closed i-can-almost-see-the-sun publish 0 0 post 0 Aesthetics Area Art Communication Community Critical Theory Experience Experience Humanities Personal Philosophy Philosophy of Social Science Social Philosophy Urban Philosophy _edit_last 1 _wp_old_slug sun-in-your-eyes _wp_old_slug the-sun-is-near _yoast_wpseo_primary_category medium_post O:11:"Medium_Post":11:{s:16:"author_image_url";s:74:"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/200/200/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png";s:10:"author_url";s:28:"https://medium.com/@rahil627";s:11:"byline_name";N;s:12:"byline_email";N;s:10:"cross_link";s:2:"no";s:2:"id";s:12:"1b7056f48be8";s:21:"follower_notification";s:3:"yes";s:7:"license";s:19:"all-rights-reserved";s:14:"publication_id";s:2:"-1";s:6:"status";s:6:"public";s:3:"url";s:66:"https://medium.com/@rahil627/i-can-almost-see-the-sun-1b7056f48be8";} The Categorization of Knowledge http://rahilpatel.com/blog/the-categorization-of-knowledge Tue, 15 Dec 2015 00:08:23 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=5725 The <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/archives">category hierarchy</a> of this blog naturally grew and naturally organized itself as I created more posts. Because I often write philosophically, the categories of my posts reflect the categories of knowledge.
 
 The blog started with categories such as "thoughts", "travel", "art", "film reviews". Then, after a some more lengthy writings, more catch-all knowledge categories were thrown, such as "philosophy", "sociology", "experience", and "psychology". I didn't know the meaning of those terms, or even of science at that time. They just made good containers.
 
 Later, I tried to use the general <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_of_knowledge#Knowledge_of_humankind">outline of knowledge</a>, especially <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_of_academic_disciplines#Social_sciences">the social science portion</a>, as a foundation for my categories. I had hierarchies such as human geography -> geography -> social science -> science. Things got weird when social sciences overlapped with philosophy, such as in critical theory -> social science -> science and philosophy -> critical theory. And again with media studies or communication. Then interdisciplinary branches appeared, like cultural studies, sociocultural anthropology, political anthropology, and so on. The hierarchy became messy, and with more posts, even more so.
 
 I'm guessing as schools change from specialized departments to mixes of specialized departments ("interdisciplinary"), they create these non-sensical categories, which is more of a statement objective of a school department more than an actual category of knowledge. Unfortunately, I use Wikipedia as my reference for knowledge, and it had led me to adopt these terms.
 
 Post-reorganization, I began to miss my old simple catch-all categories; It was an extra unnecessary step -- classifying thoughts. Furthermore, I felt quite sick of looking at my thoughts under "social sciences", itself a part of science, as I always felt they fit in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_of_academic_disciplines#Philosophy">philosophy</a>.
 
 Luckily, some old philosophical terms and Wikipedia pages still existed: philosophy of mind and social philosophy, before they turned into cognitive science, and the billion things social philosophy could be. So, I used those, then threw the wild academic "social sciences" disciplines such as critical theory, human geography, anthropology, area [studies], beneath that. Psychology now fits as an in-between of philosophy of mind and social philosophy (behavior). Communication now contains media [studies]. Even urban planning fits in there, which I'm very happy about. Well, it was either that or renaming it to philosophy of the city. Whoa, that sounds way better! <strong>Eventually, everything under "social sciences" disappeared, and reappeared under philosophy, where everything rightfully belongs.</strong>
 
 Alas, the categorization of knowledge according to my mind, which is, simply, a set of large catch-all sub-philosophy categories.
 
 I'm quite happy with that. <strong>It's such a delight not to organize things.</strong>
 
 Perhaps the categorization of my posts have another fruit: A rather striking result of it is that <strong>it seems that I've never thought about science</strong>. I've thought about the philosophy of science, as this post itself may be about the philosophy of social science, but never science. All of my posts fit under the humanities, at first art, then later philosophy, including social philosophy. <strong>That might be a good indicator that I simply am not interested in science, and that I should avoid it in my future.</strong>
 
 <strong>Looking back, I also think that the things I specifically think and write about are actually philosophy, in the continental philosophy sense, that is, observational writings and theories, not social science</strong>. The scientific method is never applied. Everything I think about is based on my experiences. "Social sciences" seems to have now adapted qualitative methods in addition to their quantitative methods. My social philosophy doesn't contain any quantitative methods at all, and really, I'm still skeptical about it. Furthermore, my social philosophy usually only cites works if I quote someone. I never rigorously search and cite primary sources; That sounds much more difficult and far less fun than having a real experience. I just simply enjoy talking and writing some bullshit philosophy, which hopefully, some of which, turns out to be less bullshit than social science. <strong>This attitude may not be helpful in the scientific enterprise, but that's less important than the social progress enterprise,</strong> especially now.
 
 I peeked at a few more Wikipedia articles:
 
 <blockquote><strong>The humanities use methods that are primarily critical, or speculative, and have a significant historical element—as distinguished from the mainly empirical approaches of the natural sciences</strong>
 <cite><em>Wikipedia</em>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanities">Humanities</a></cite></blockquote>
 
 <strong>I guess that makes me a humanist.</strong>
 
 Previously, at this point, this post digressed after reading the Wikipedia article on humanism. That digression has now been moved to <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/on-humanism">On Humanism</a>.
 
 It turns out that the term humanist refers to both, a scholar of the humanities and a person who agrees with humanism, so I guess that makes me a humanatee, a manatee of the humanities.

It's also relevant to <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/valuable-things-ive-written#criticism_capitalism_communication_rationality">recent posts about rationality</a>, especially the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antihumanism">anti-humanism Wikipedia article</a>, which includes content from past philosophical movements related to humanism.
 
 <blockquote>Humanism is a philosophical and ethical stance that emphasizes the value and agency of human beings, individually and collectively, and generally prefers critical thinking and evidence (rationalism, empiricism) over unthinking acceptance of dogma or superstition. The meaning of the term humanism has fluctuated according to the successive intellectual movements which have identified with it. Generally, however, humanism refers to a perspective that affirms some notion of human freedom and progress.
 <cite><em>Wikipedia</em>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanism">Humanism</a></cite></blockquote>
 
 It seems difficult to define humanism. From my skimming of the Wikipedia article, humanism seems to be optimistic of human progress, of the ability to gain knowledge about humans, and, notoriously, of the ability to "collectively" guide humans toward progress.
 
 <blockquote>From the belief in a universal moral core of humanity it followed that all persons are inherently free and equal. For liberal humanists such as Kant, the universal law of reason was a guide towards total emancipation from any kind of tyranny.
 ...
 Nietzsche argues in Genealogy of Morals that human rights exist as a means for the weak to constrain the strong; as such, they do not facilitate the emancipation of life, but instead deny it.
 ...
 Marx believed human rights were a product of the very dehumanization they were intended to oppose.
 ...
 Foucault challenged the foundational aspects of Enlightenment humanism, as well as their strategic implications, arguing that they either produced counter-emancipatory results directly, or matched increased "freedom" with increased and disciplinary normalization.
 
 His anti-humanist skepticism extended to attempts to ground theory in human feeling, as much as in human reason, maintaining that both were historically contingent constructs, rather than the universals humanism maintained.
 <cite><em>Wikipedia</em>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antihumanism">Anti-humanism</a></cite></blockquote>
 
 <blockquote>Postmodern critics who are self-described anti-humanists...have asserted that humanism posits an overarching and excessively abstract notion of humanity or universal human nature, which can then be used as a pretext for imperialism and domination of those deemed somehow less than human.
 <cite><em>Wikipedia</em>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanism#Polemics">Humanism, polemics section</a></cite></blockquote>
 
 <strong>The main problem of humanism seems to be that in order to achieve "human freedom and progress", it motivates people to ascribe the method of creating "universal laws", the basis of politics, which impede freedom, and therefore, impedes progress for those who's freedom is impeded.</strong>
 
 It seems that anti-humanists are anarchists. Is there another method to achieve freedom and progress without creating rules (laws, policies, etc.)? An ideology. There is no need for laws or policies; An ideology is enough. It is society's norms. Individuals are free, just pressured by the majority of society. Anarchic individuals and the majority can live their own ways. <strong>The problem is when anarchists are unable to live within the ideology.</strong>
 
 That's <em>the</em> problem (!!!). How can an anarchist live, for example, in any capitalistic country, where one must obtain currency in order to exchange for basic goods (rent, food, health)? Well, I think one almost always has the option to go into the wild and live off of nature, but that's an extreme degree; Not all anarchists self-sufficient farmers or hunter-gatherers. Instead of thinking about an individual, the question should be reframed from the point of an anarchic community. How can an anarchist community live within the ideology?
 
 Again, using capitalism as an example of ideology, they can probably horde together some food and housing, but health is still part of the public sector, and rent still exists. These can be somewhat relieved by living further from a city, or in a cheap district of a city (likely a slum), but that brings another problem: <strong>cities offer more human development potential, but anarchists are unable to live there because the cost of rent is high.</strong>
 
 Well, that's a problem of capitalism. And I've digressed into anti-capitalism again. <strong>I should continue this thought within non-capitalism ideologies</strong> [todo]. Ah well. That's that. 5763 2015-12-17 10:56:19 2015-12-17 15:56:19 open closed on-humanism publish 0 0 post 0 Community Empericism Epistemology Ethics Humanities Philosophical Movements Philosophy Political Philosophy Rationalism Rationality Social Anarchism Social Philosophy _edit_last 1 _yoast_wpseo_primary_category medium_post O:11:"Medium_Post":11:{s:16:"author_image_url";s:74:"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/200/200/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png";s:10:"author_url";s:28:"https://medium.com/@rahil627";s:11:"byline_name";N;s:12:"byline_email";N;s:10:"cross_link";s:2:"no";s:2:"id";s:12:"b87f22b916aa";s:21:"follower_notification";s:3:"yes";s:7:"license";s:19:"all-rights-reserved";s:14:"publication_id";s:2:"-1";s:6:"status";s:6:"public";s:3:"url";s:53:"https://medium.com/@rahil627/on-humanism-b87f22b916aa";} Time and Space in Anthropology http://rahilpatel.com/blog/time-and-space-in-anthropology Sat, 19 Dec 2015 08:48:50 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=5786 [todo: kind of messy, but I think I got out the main ideas: comp lit / phil, the impossibility of mirror of reality, emphasis on time instead of space, <strong>should look at past pictures that I took to understand the world</strong> {mmmm, this is a good idea that I didn't mention.

 I've been moving around since I received a bicycle at age 4, and since at least then it seems, compared to others, I've always emphasized space over time. Contrary to me, people who write books don't seem to travel much (probably reading and writing so much) and emphasize time, looking back in history. As a person who enjoys traveling and doesn't enjoy reading, I've tended to disregard writers, many of whom maybe be classified as academics, and time.
 
 As travel is more natural to me, so is comparing societies and the areas they exist in.
 
 Academics seem to tend to look at societies historically, to gain ideas that worked in the past and reuse them for the future, or see compare the trajectories of societies in the past, but isn't it easier to simply walk around one's own country -- from rural to urban, variously sized settlements, ethnic enclaves, and perhaps, to neighboring countries -- to not just gain ideas, but a better understanding of the world?
 
 <strong>One of the simplest and greatest learning experiences is simply going to the most developed city</strong> one can. One will immediately experience good urban planning, good neighborhoods, good creative and innovative environments, and good communities.
 
 <strong>The next great experience is to travel from a good creative area to nature, experiencing all of the steps in the development of societies in-between -- the entire spectrum of urban development.</strong> Though, I wouldn't say the spectrum of human development. This experience is especially useful in a society under a capitalistic system, because capitalistic cities are so corrupt, and better values can be found outside of it, often, just outside of it.
 
 What next? Travel more societies? Live in one of the past societies? [todo]

 I always feel that one is able to have infinite experiences with the many societies that exist right now, at this time. Instead of looking at history, one could simply find some aboriginal tribes. Even just outside of the cities in Virginia, USA, where I'm from, one can probably find people living on a similar standard to aboriginals. The difference here is only the import of manufactured products, though, it's quite difficult to evade global capitalism even in the most remote regions.

 Hmm, I guess what I was getting at is that reading histories of societies cannot replace experience in contemporary societies, for the same reasons a book cannot replace an experience -- it's not holistic; It's missing the ecology.
 
 There is no way to mirror reality into the medium, though, film comes close. So reading histories will always be missing much information. <strong>The mind cannot form the precision that reality offers from media.</strong>
 
 [todo: was trying to get to the point where the mind thinks with recent audio-visual experiences best, because the detail of it only constrained by the mind] 
 --
 
 It seems higher order academic disciplines compare academic disciplines and hopefully by now more modern medias, titling it "comparative [subject]", i.e. comparative literature, comparative history, etc. This discipline also seems to somehow overlap with my favorite direction: critical theory. <strong>The people who compare medias sometimes find light in their comparisons of societies at different times in history</strong>, i.e. Foucault's findings of how institutions have developed over time.
 
 <strong>That's not how I think, and maybe, it's not natural to think that way. I think about my personal experiences in societies, travel or living.</strong> How do the suburbs in Virginia compare to the city of San Francisco, San Francisco to New York, New York to other cities in the world, Singapore to Hong Kong, the culture of Korea to Japan, the culture of Taiwan to Nepal, the culture of Taiwan aborigines to the culture of Zomia, Taipei to Japan, the other cities in Taiwan to other huge cities, the slums in India to the Myanmar refugee camps in Thailand, the railway and railway towns of Asia, and so on. I just don't think any amount of media can overcome the natural tendency to compare real experiences to real experiences. Certainly not in reading. Film has a chance, but it would have to be done in the form of lengthy documentaries.
 
 <strong>So here again, I grind against academia and their use of a mirror of reality, as opposed to reality, to excavate knowledge and ideas.</strong> History is one way to compare societies, but it should be far less privileged than travel. <strong>I'd conjecture that academia's tradition of privileging classics and privileging writing a medium has lead to academia privileging time over space.</strong> It's true that global capitalism is eating away at all culture, but it hasn't come to the point where one must look to the past through mediums for insight. The insight is in existing societies, in reality, and always will be, well, until the world loses to global capitalism. 5786 2015-12-19 03:48:50 2015-12-19 08:48:50 open closed time-and-space-in-anthropology publish 0 0 post 0 Anthropology Experience Humanities Media Personal Philosophy Philosophy of Education Philosophy of History Philosophy of Social Science Social Philosophy Thoughts Travel _edit_last 1 Urban and Suburban Culture http://rahilpatel.com/blog/urban-and-suburban-culture Mon, 21 Dec 2015 16:05:10 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=5833 21/12/15

 Reading the Wikipedia article on Plato's theory of Forms reminded me of an old thought.
 
 During more creative, physical times, I often ponder, <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/how-the-material-came-to-be">how the material in the world came to be</a>. Often, simultaneously, as an act of creativity and toward creating a better world, I think about how the material can be re-organized.
 
 The contemporary world is just a possibility. Every man-made material conglomerate is a form, an idea from history.
 
 During this time, I often disregard the intended use of man-made material conglomerates. Let's call them them products. Instead, I use material in a more efficient manner. It leads to a seemingly primitive life, improvising with the current material world to my needs for survival, creativity, and whatever my intentions life are at the time. The re-organization of material is material creativity. Let's call it design.
 
 [todo: need to continue this thought]
 --
 
 Designers start with nothing. An empty place. When one needs something, a product, one either fetches an existing product, improvises with existing products, or creates a product from material. In the process of starting with nothing, one gains material, and with it, creates products of multiple uses[, leading toward minimalism]. The materials and products build upon each other, leading to more combinations and uses. It's self-organization. [todo: need to continue]

 [todo: another thought, about how wealthy people have a privileged choice: they can simply buy an existing product to meet their needs, simultaneously showing their lack of creativity, exercise of power in a capitalist society, and destruction of nature (creative destruction?). i.e. American cookie-cutter suburbia as opposed to poorer Asian cities]

 [todo: What triggered the old thought was a particular example describing the problem of universals: using table-ness to describe a table. Almost anything flat can be used as a table, including the floor. <strong>And so, out of a desire in efficacy of time and cost, this is how my mind words. I use anything for the purposes that I want. I don't think about existing products that have been manufactured or created in the past for specific purposes.</strong> The area that I am in is my sandbox (or lego bucket?): the material within the area can be used to my liking...]

 [todo: It seems I was getting at some kind of natural order of material, as opposed to the dogmatic use of existing ideas through material products. This most familiarly applies to household and personal products. This also applies to the forms within a room, a city, and country.

 ‘The Metropolis and Mental Life’
 
 <strong>The deepest problems of modern life</strong> flow from the attempt of the individual to maintain the independence and individuality of his existence against the sovereign powers of society, against the weight of the historical heritage and the external culture and technique of life. This antagonism represents the most modern form of the conflict which primitive man must carry on with nature for his own bodily existence. The eighteenth century may have called for liberation from all the ties which grew up historically in politics, in religion, in morality and in economics in order to permit the original natural virtue of man, which is equal in everyone, to develop without inhibition; the nineteenth century may have sought to promote, in addition to man's freedom, his individuality (which is connected with the division of labour) and his achievements which make him unique and indispensable but which at the same time make him so much the more dependent on the complementary activity of others; Nietzsche may have seen the relentless struggle of the individual as the prerequisite for his full development, while Socialism found the same thing in the suppression of all competition — but in each of these the same fundamental motive was at work, namely the resistance of the individual to being levelled, swallowed up in the social-technological mechanism. When one inquires about the products of the specifically modern aspects of contemporary life with reference to their inner meaning — when, so to speak, one examines the body of culture with reference to the soul, as I am to do concerning the metropolis today — the answer will require the investigation of the relationship which such a social structure promotes between the individual aspects of life and those which transcend the existence of single individuals. It will require the investigation of the adaptations made by the personality in its adjustment to the forces that lie outside of it.
 
 <strong>The psychological foundation</strong>, upon which the metropolitan individuality is erected, is the intensification of emotional life due to the swift and continuous shift of external and internal stimuli [<a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/creativity-external-stimuli-cities-and-suburbs">Creativity, External Stimuli, Cities, and Suburbs</a>, <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/time-social-life-and-external-stimuli">Time, Social Life, and External Stimuli</a>]. Man is a creature whose existence is dependent on differences, i.e., his mind is stimulated by the difference between present impressions and those which have preceded [<a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/working-memory-and-creativity">Working Memory and Creativity</a>]. Lasting impressions, the slightness in their differences, the habituated regularity of their course and contrasts between them, [<a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/habit-and-addiction">Habit and Addiction</a>] consume, so to speak, less mental energy than the rapid telescoping of changing images [<a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/prose-is-superfluous-active-communication-through-play-and-art">Prose is Superfluous: Active Communication through Play and Art</a>, <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/the-speed-of-ideas">The Speed of Ideas</a>, <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/information-organization-mediums-creativity-and-experience">Information Organization, Mediums, Creativity, and Experience</a>, <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/city-experience-and-media">City Experience and Media</a>, <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/forms-of-consumption-reality-and-media">Forms of Consumption: Reality and Media</a>], pronounced differences within what is grasped at a single glance, and the unexpectedness of violent stimuli [<a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/lone-work-and-depression">Lone Work and Depression</a>, <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/hypomania">Hypomania</a>, <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/the-apex-of-mania-and-creativity-in-taipei">The Apex of Mania and Creativity in Taipei</a>, <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/korea-and-the-apex-of-spd">Korea and the Apex of SPD</a>, <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/hypomania-and-creativity">Hypomania and Creativity</a>]. To the extent that the metropolis creates these psychological conditions — with every crossing of the street, with the tempo and multiplicity of economic, occupational and social life [<a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/time-social-life-and-external-stimuli">Time, Social Life, and External Stimuli</a>] — it creates in the sensory foundations of mental life, and in the degree of awareness [<a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/awareness-and-consciousness">Awareness and Consciousness</a>] necessitated by our organization as creatures dependent on differences, a deep contrast with the slower, more habitual, more smoothly flowing rhythm of the sensory-mental phase of small town and rural existence [<a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/flexibility">Flexibility</a>]. Thereby the essentially intellectualistic character of the mental life of the metropolis becomes intelligible as over against that of the small town which rests more on feelings and emotional relationships. These latter are rooted in the unconscious levels of the mind and develop most readily in the steady equilibrium of unbroken customs. The locus of reason, on the other hand, is in the lucid, conscious upper strata of the mind and it is the most adaptable of our inner forces [<a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/flexibility-and-learning">Flexibility and Learning</a>]. In order to adjust itself to the shifts and contradictions in events, it does not require the disturbances and inner upheavals which are the only means whereby more conservative personalities are able to adapt themselves to the same rhythm of events. Thus the metropolitan type — which naturally takes on a thousand individual modifications — creates a protective organ for itself against the profound disruption with which the fluctuations and discontinuities of the external milieu threaten it [todo: I think I had a draft about creating rules in the mind, <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/chaos-and-organization">Chaos and Organization</a>]. Instead of reacting emotionally, the metropolitan type reacts primarily in a rational manner, thus creating a mental predominance through the intensification of consciousness, which in turn is caused by it. Thus the reaction of the metropolitan person to those events is moved to a sphere of mental activity which is least sensitive and which is furthest removed from the depths of the personality.
 
 <strong>This intellectualistic quality</strong> which is thus recognized as a protection of the inner life against the domination of the metropolis, becomes ramified into numerous specific phenomena. The metropolis has always been the seat of money economy because the many-sidedness and concentration of commercial activity have given the medium of exchange an importance which it could not have acquired in the commercial aspects of rural life [<a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/free-from-capitalism">Free from Capitalism</a>?]. But money economy and the domination of the intellect stand in the closest relationship to one another. They have in common a purely matter-of-fact attitude in the treatment of persons and things in which a formal justice is often combined with an unrelenting hardness. The purely intellectualistic person is indifferent to all things personal because, out of them, relationships and reactions develop which are not to be completely understood by purely rational methods — just as the unique element in events never enters into the principle of money. Money is concerned only with what is common to all, i.e., with the exchange value which reduces all quality and individuality to a purely quantitative level [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt:_The_First_5000_Years">Debt</a> by David Graeber]. All emotional relationships between persons rest on their individuality, whereas intellectual relationships deal with persons as with numbers, that is, as with elements which, in themselves, are indifferent, but which are of interest only insofar as they offer something objectively perceivable. It is in this very manner that the inhabitant of the metropolis reckons with his merchant, his customer, and with his servant, and frequently with the persons with whom he is thrown into obligatory association. These relationships stand in distinct contrast with the nature of the smaller circle in which the inevitable knowledge of individual characteristics produces, with an equal inevitability, an emotional tone in conduct, a sphere which is beyond the mere objective weighting of tasks performed and payments made [tourism]. What is essential here as regards the economic-psychological aspect of the problem is that in less advanced cultures production was for the customer who ordered the product so that the producer and the purchaser knew one another [barter? gift economy?]. The modern city, however, is supplied almost exclusively by production for the market, that is, for entirely unknown purchasers who never appear in the actual field of vision of the producers themselves. Thereby, the interests of each party acquire a relentless matter-of- factness, and its rationally calculated economic egoism need not fear any divergence from its set path because of the imponderability of personal relationships. This is all the more the case in the money economy which dominates the metropolis in which the last remnants of domestic production and direct barter of goods have been eradicated and in which the amount of production on direct personal order is reduced daily [independent merchants vs manufactured products]. Furthermore, this psychological intellectualistic attitude and the money economy are in such close integration that no one is able to say whether it was the former that effected the latter or vice versa. What is certain is only that the form of life in the metropolis is the soil which nourishes this interaction most fruitfully, a point which I shall attempt to demonstrate only with the statement of the most outstanding English constitutional historian to the effect that through the entire course of English history London has never acted as the heart of England but often as its intellect and always as its money bag [ouch! London as past <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/silicon-valley-and-capitalism">Silicon Valley and Capitalism</a>].
 
 In certain apparently insignificant characters or traits of the most external aspects of life are to be found a number of characteristic mental tendencies. <strong>The modern mind has become more and more a calculating one</strong> [todo: personal experience in the city, Marx-like economic eye]. The calculating exactness of practical life which has resulted from a money economy corresponds to the ideal of natural science, namely that of transforming the world into an arithmetical problem and of fixing every one of its parts in a mathematical formula [critique of old economic quantitative institutions]. It has been money economy which has thus filled the daily life of so many people with weighing, calculating, enumerating and the reduction of qualitative values to quantitative terms. Because of the character of calculability which money has there has come into the relationships of the elements of life a precision and a degree of certainty in the definition of the equalities and inequalities and an unambiguousness in agreements and arrangements, just as externally this precision has been brought about through the general diffusion of pocket watches [social time, in addition to money, is also quantitative: time is money]. It is, however, the conditions of the metropolis which are cause as well as effect for this essential characteristic. The relationships and concerns of the typical metropolitan resident are so manifold and complex that, especially as a result of the agglomeration of so many persons with such differentiated interests [diversity], their relationships and activities intertwine with one another into a many-membered organism [part of many communities]. In view of this fact, the lack of the most exact punctuality in promises and performances would cause the whole to break down into an inextricable chaos [hmmm]. If all the watches in Berlin suddenly went wrong in different ways even only as much as an hour, its entire economic and commercial life would be derailed for some time [true]. Even though this may seem more superficial in its significance, it transpires that the magnitude of distances results in making all waiting and the breaking of appointments an ill-afforded waste of time. For this reason the technique of metropolitan life in general is not conceivable without all of its activities and reciprocal relationships being organized and coordinated in the most punctual way into a firmly fixed framework of time which transcends all subjective elements. But here too there emerge those conclusions which are in general the whole task of this discussion, namely, that every event, however restricted to this superficial level it may appear, comes immediately into contact with the depths of the soul, and that the most banal externalities are, in the last analysis, bound up with the final decisions concerning the meaning and the style of life [quantitative city life affects the soul]. Punctuality, calculability, and exactness, which are required by the complications and extensiveness of metropolitan life are not only most intimately connected with its capitalistic and intellectualistic character but also colour the content of life and are conducive to the exclusion of those irrational, instinctive, sovereign human traits and impulses which originally seek to determine the form of life from within instead of receiving it from the outside in a general, schematically precise form [the city only allows overly quantitative, rational beings, no other ways in life -- ascetic, aboriginal culture, anarchic societies, non-capitalist thoughts, philosophers, etc.]. Even though those lives which are autonomous and characterised by these vital impulses are not entirely impossible in the city, they are, none the less, opposed to it in abstracto [dominated by city social norm]. It is in the light of this that we can explain the passionate hatred of personalities like Ruskin and Nietzsche for the metropolis — personalities who found the value of life only in unschematized individual expressions which cannot be reduced to exact equivalents and in whom, on that account, there flowed from the same source as did that hatred, the hatred of the money economy and of the intellectualism of existence [<a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/new-york-and-taiwan">New York and Taiwan</a>].
 
 The same factors which, in the exactness and the minute precision of the form of life, have coalesced into a structure of the highest impersonality [<a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/okinawana-is-inhospitable">Okinawa is Inhospitable</a>], have, on the other hand, an influence in a highly personal direction. There is perhaps no psychic phenomenon which is so unconditionally reserved to the city as <strong>the blasé outlook</strong>. It is at first the consequence of those rapidly shifting stimulations of the nerves which are thrown together in all their contrasts and from which it seems to us the intensification of metropolitan intellectuality seems to be derived. On that account it is not likely that stupid persons who have been hitherto intellectually dead will be blasé. Just as an immoderately sensuous life makes one blasé because it stimulates the nerves to their utmost reactivity until they finally can no longer produce any reaction at all, so, less harmful stimuli, through the rapidity and the contradictoriness of their shifts, force the nerves to make such violent responses, tear them about so brutally that they exhaust their last reserves of strength and, remaining in the same milieu, do not have time for new reserves to form. This incapacity to react to new stimulations with the required amount of energy [need time for thinking] constitutes in fact that blasé attitude which every child of a large city evinces when compared with the products of the more peaceful and more stable milieu.
 
 Combined with this physiological source of the blasé metropolitan attitude there is another which derives from a money economy. The essence of the blasé attitude is an <strong>indifference toward the distinctions between things</strong>. Not in the sense that they are not perceived, as is the case of mental dullness, but rather that the meaning and the value of the distinctions between things, and therewith of the things themselves, are experienced as meaningless. They appear to the blasé person in a homogeneous, flat and gray colour with no one of them worthy of being preferred to another [hmm, I don't think I've experienced this]. This psychic mood is the correct subjective reflection of a complete money economy to the extent that money takes the place of all the manifoldness of things and expresses all qualitative distinctions between them in the distinction of how much. To the extent that money, with its colourlessness and its indifferent quality, can become a common denominator of all values it becomes the frightful leveller — it hollows out the core of things, their peculiarities, their specific values and their uniqueness and incomparability in a way which is beyond repair. They all float with the same specific gravity in the constantly moving stream of money. They all rest on the same level and are distinguished only by their amounts. In individual cases this colouring, or rather this de-colouring of things, through their equation with money, may be imperceptibly small. In the relationship, however, which the wealthy person has to objects which can be bought for money, perhaps indeed in the total character which, for this reason, public opinion now recognizes in these objects, it takes on very considerable proportions [awareness directed toward extrinsic values?]. This is why the metropolis is the seat of commerce and it is in it that the purchasability of things appears in quite a different aspect than in simpler economies. It is also the peculiar seat of the blasé attitude. In it is brought to a peak, in a certain way, that achievement in the concentration of purchasable things which stimulates the individual to the highest degree of nervous energy. Through the mere quantitative intensification of the same conditions this achievement is transformed into its opposite, into this peculiar adaptive phenomenon — the blasé attitude — in which the nerves reveal their final possibility of adjusting themselves to the content and the form of metropolitan life by renouncing the response to them [definitely never felt this]. We see that the self-preservation of certain types of personalities is obtained at the cost of devaluing the entire objective world, ending inevitably in dragging the personality downward into a feeling of its own valuelessness.
 
 Whereas the subject of this form of existence must come to terms with it for himself, his self-preservation in the face of the great city requires of him a no less negative type of social conduct. The mental attitude of the people of the metropolis to one another may be designated formally as one of reserve. If the unceasing external contact of numbers of persons in the city should be met by the same number of inner reactions as in the small town, in which one knows almost every person he meets and to each of whom he has a positive relationship, one would be completely atomized internally and would fall into an unthinkable mental condition [hence the need of small neighborhoods]. Partly this psychological circumstance and partly the privilege of suspicion which we have in the face of the elements of metropolitan life (which are constantly touching one another in fleeting contact) necessitates in us that reserve, in consequence of which we do not know by sight neighbours of years standing and which permits us to appear to small-town folk so often as cold and uncongenial. Indeed, if I am not mistaken, the inner side of this external reserve is not only indifference but more frequently than we believe, it is a slight aversion, a mutual strangeness and repulsion which, in a close contact which has arisen any way whatever, can break out into hatred and conflict [? maybe Georg is sympathizing with small towns, and hasn't had a good experience in the city]. The entire inner organization of such a type of extended commercial life rests on an extremely varied structure of sympathies, indifferences and aversions of the briefest as well as of the most enduring sort. This sphere of indifference is, for this reason, not as great as it seems superficially. Our minds respond, with some definite feeling, to almost every impression emanating from another person. The unconsciousness, the transitoriness and the shift of these feelings seem to raise them only into indifference. Actually this latter would be as unnatural to us as immersion into a chaos of unwished-for suggestions would be unbearable. From these two typical dangers of metropolitan life we are saved by antipathy which is the latent adumbration of actual antagonism since it brings about the sort of distantiation and deflection without which this type of life could not be carried on at all. Its extent and its mixture, the rhythm of its emergence and disappearance, the forms in which it is adequate — these constitute, with the simplified motives (in the narrower sense) an inseparable totality of the form of metropolitan life. <strong>What appears here directly as dissociation is in reality only one of the elementary forms of socialization</strong> [<a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/the-tale-of-the-princess-kaguya">The Tale of the Princess Kaguya</a>, <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/only-yesterday">Only Yesterday</a>].
 
 This reserve with its overtone of concealed aversion appears once more, however, as the form or the wrappings of a much more general psychic trait of the metropolis. It assures the individual of a type and degree of personal freedom to which there is no analogy in other circumstances. It has its roots in one of the great developmental tendencies of social life as a whole; in one of the few for which an approximately exhaustive formula can be discovered. <strong>The most elementary stage of social organization which is to be found historically, as well as in the present, is this: a relatively small circle</strong> almost entirely closed against neighbouring foreign or otherwise antagonistic groups but which has however within itself such a narrow cohesion that the individual member has only a very slight area for the development of his own qualities and for free activity for which he himself is responsible. Political and familial groups began in this way as do political and religious communities; the self-preservation of very young associations requires a rigourous setting of boundaries and a centripetal unity and for that reason it cannot give room to freedom and the peculiarities of inner and external development of the individual [physical and social space defines boundaries of development]. From this stage social evolution proceeds simultaneously in two divergent but none the less corresponding directions. In the measure that the group grows numerically, spatially, and in the meaningful content of life, its immediate inner unity and the definiteness of its original demarcation against others are weakened and rendered mild by reciprocal interactions and interconnections [more density more tolerance for diversity]. And at the same time the individual gains a freedom of movement far beyond the first jealous delimitation, and gains also a peculiarity and individuality to which the division of labour in groups, which have become larger, gives both occasion and necessity. However much the particular conditions and forces of the individual situation might modify the general scheme, the state and Christianity, guilds and political parties and innumerable other groups have developed in accord with this formula. This tendency seems to me, however, to be quite clearly recognizable also in the development of individuality within the framework of city life. Small town life in antiquity as well as in the Middle Ages imposed such limits upon the movements of the individual in his relationships with the outside world and on his inner independence and differentiation that the modern person could not even breathe under such conditions. Even today the city dweller who is placed in a small town feels a type of narrowness which is very similar [city vs suburb culture]. The smaller the circle which forms our environment [environment contains limiting culture] and the more limited the relationships which have the possibility of transcending the boundaries [relationships as transcendence of culture], the more anxiously the narrow community watches over the deeds, the conduct of life and the attitudes of the individual and the more will a quantitative and qualitative individuality tend to pass beyond the boundaries of such a community.
 
 <strong>The ancient polis seems in this regard to have had a character of a small town.</strong> The incessant threat against its existence by enemies from near and far brought about that stern cohesion in political and military matters, that supervision of the citizen by other citizens, and that jealousy of the whole toward the individual whose own private life was repressed to such an extent that he could compensate himself only by acting as a despot in his own household [nationalism]. The tremendous agitation and excitement, and the unique colourfulness of Athenian life is perhaps explained by the fact that a people of incomparably individualized personalities were in constant struggle against the incessant inner and external oppression of a de-individualizing small town [<a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/constant-action-ethics">Constant Action Ethics</a>] . This created an atmosphere of tension in which the weaker were held down and the stronger were impelled to the most passionate type of self-protection. And with this there blossomed in Athens, what, without being able to define it exactly, must be designated as 'the general human character' in the intellectual development of our species [first recorded time humans developed fully, independent? Heck no.]. For the correlation, the factual as well as the historical validity of which we are here maintaining, <strong>is that the broadest and the most general contents and forms of life are intimately bound up with the most individual ones. Both have a common prehistory and also common enemies in the narrow formations and groupings, whose striving for self-preservation set them in conflict with the broad and general on the outside, as well as the freely mobile and individual on the inside</strong> [priority for individualism, individuals will always exist within and out, resisting any kind of normative culture]. Just as in feudal times the 'free' man was he who stood under the law of the land, that is, under the law of the largest social unit, but he was unfree who derived his legal rights only from the narrow circle of a feudal community — so today in an intellectualized and refined sense the citizen of the metropolis is 'free' in contrast with the trivialities and prejudices which bind the small town person. The mutual reserve and indifference, and the intellectual conditions of life in large social units are never more sharply appreciated in their significance for the independence of the individual than <strong>in the dense crowds of the metropolis because the bodily closeness and lack of space make intellectual distance really perceivable for the first time. It is obviously only the obverse of this freedom that, under certain circumstances, one never feels as lonely and as deserted as in this metropolitan crush of persons</strong> [city community, <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/large-and-small-communities">Large and Small Communities</a>]. For here, as elsewhere, it is by no means necessary that the freedom of man reflect itself in his emotional life only as a pleasant experience.
 
 [todo: STOPPED HERE]
 It is not only the immediate size of the area and population which, on the basis of world-historical correlation between the increase in the size of the social unit and the degree of personal inner and outer freedom, makes the metropolis the locus of this condition. It is rather in transcending this purely tangible extensiveness that the metropolis also becomes the seat of cosmopolitanism. Comparable with the form of the development of wealth — (beyond a certain point property increases in ever more rapid progression as out of its own inner being) — the individual's horizon is enlarged. In the same way, economic, personal and intellectual relations in the city (which are its ideal reflection), grow in a geometrical progression as soon as, for the first time, a certain limit has been passed. Every dynamic extension becomes a preparation not only for a similar extension but rather for a larger one and from every thread which is spun out of it there continue, growing as out of themselves, an endless number of others. This may be illustrated by the fact that within the city the 'unearned increment' of ground rent, through a mere increase in traffic, brings to the owner profits which are self-generating. At this point the quantitative aspects of life are transformed qualitatively. The sphere of life of the small town is, in the main, enclosed within itself. For the metropolis it is decisive that its inner life is extended in a wave-like motion over a broader national or international area. Weimar was no exception because its significance was dependent upon individual personalities and died with them, whereas the metropolis is characterised by its essential independence even of the most significant individual personalities; this is rather its antithesis and it is the price of independence which the individual living in it enjoys. The most significant aspect of the metropolis lies in this functional magnitude beyond its actual physical boundaries and this effectiveness reacts upon the latter and gives to it life, weight, importance and responsibility. A person does not end with limits of his physical body or with the area to which his physical activity is immediately confined but embraces, rather, the totality of meaningful effects which emanates from him temporally and spatially. In the same way the city exists only in the totality of the effects which transcend their immediate sphere. These really are the actual extent in which their existence is expressed. This is already expressed in the fact that individual freedom, which is the logical historical complement of such extension, is not only to be understood in the negative sense as mere freedom of movement and emancipation from prejudices and philistinism. Its essential characteristic is rather to be found in the fact that the particularity and incomparability which ultimately every person possesses in some way is actually expressed, giving form to life. That we follow the laws of our inner nature — and this is what freedom is — becomes perceptible and convincing to us and to others only when the expressions of this nature distinguish themselves from others; it is our irreplaceability by others which shows that our mode of existence is not imposed upon us from the outside.
 Cities are above all the seat of the most advanced economic division of labour. They produce such extreme phenomena as the lucrative vocation of the quatorzieme in Paris. These are persons who may be recognized by shields on their houses and who hold themselves ready at the dinner hour in appropriate costumes so they can he called upon on short notice in case thirteen persons find themselves at the table. Exactly in the measure of its extension the city offers to an increasing degree the determining conditions for the division of labour. It is a unit which, because of its large size, is receptive to a highly diversified plurality of achievements while at the same time the agglomeration of individuals and their struggle for the customer forces the individual to a type of specialized accomplishment in which he cannot be so easily exterminated by the other. The decisive fact here is that in the life of a city, struggle with nature for the means of life is transformed into a conflict with human beings and the gain which is fought for is granted, not by nature, but by man. For here we find not only the previously mentioned source of specialization but rather the deeper one in which the seller must seek to produce in the person to whom he wishes to sell ever new and unique needs. The necessity to specialize one's product in order to find a source of income which is not yet exhausted and also to specialize a function which cannot be easily supplanted is conducive to differentiation, refinement and enrichment of the needs of the public which obviously must lead to increasing personal variation within this public.
 
 All this leads to the narrower type of intellectual individuation of mental qualities to which the city gives rise in proportion to its size. There is a whole series of causes for this. First of all there is the difficulty of giving one's own personality a certain status within the framework of metropolitan life. Where quantitative increase of value and energy has reached its limits, one seizes on qualitative distinctions, so that, through taking advantage of the existing sensitivity to differences, the attention of the social world can, in some way, he won for oneself. This leads ultimately to the strangest eccentricities, to specifically metropolitan extravagances of self-distantiation, of caprice, of fastidiousness, the meaning of which is no longer to be found in the content of such activity itself but rather in its being a form of 'being different' — of making oneself noticeable. For many types of persons these are still the only means of saving for oneself, through the attention gained from others, some sort of self-esteem and the sense of filling a position. In the same sense there operates an apparently insignificant factor which in its effects however is perceptibly cumulative, namely, the brevity and rarity of meetings which are allotted to each individual as compared with social intercourse in a small city. For here we find the attempt to appear to-the-point, clear-cut and individual with extraordinarily greater frequency than where frequent and long association assures to each person an unambiguous conception of the other's personality [whoa].
 
 This appears to me to be the most profound cause of the fact that the metropolis places emphasis on striving for the most individual forms of personal existence — regardless of whether it is always correct or always successful. The development of modern culture is characterised by the predominance of what one can call the objective spirit over the subjective; that is, in language as well as in law, in the technique of production as well as in art, in science as well as in the objects of domestic environment, there is embodied a sort of spirit [Geist], the daily growth of which is followed only imperfectly and with an even greater lag by the intellectual development of the individual. If we survey for instance the vast culture which during the last century has been embodied in things and in knowledge, in institutions and comforts, and if we compare them with the cultural progress of the individual during the same period — at least in the upper classes — we would see a frightful difference in rate of growth between the two which represents, in many points, rather a regression of the culture of the individual with reference to spirituality, delicacy and idealism. This discrepancy is in essence the result of the success of the growing division of labour. For it is this which requires from the individual an ever more one-sided type of achievement which, at its highest point, often permits his personality as a whole to fall into neglect. In any case this overgrowlh of objective culture has been less and less satisfactory for the individual. Perhaps less conscious than in practical activity and in the obscure complex of feelings which flow from him, he is reduced to a negligible quantity. He becomes a single cog as over against the vast overwhelming organization of things and forces which gradually take out of his hands everything connected with progress, spirituality and value. The operation of these forces results in the transformation of the latter from a subjective form into one of purely objective existence. It need only be pointed out that the metropolis is the proper arena for this type of culture which has outgrown every personal element. Here in buildings and in educational institutions, in the wonders and comforts of space-conquering technique, in the formations of social life and in the concrete institutions of the State is to be found such a tremendous richness of crystallizing, depersonalized cultural accomplishments that the personality can, so to speak, scarcely maintain itself in the face of it. From one angle life is made infinitely more easy in the sense that stimulations, interests, and the taking up of time and attention, present themselves from all sides and carry it in a stream which scarcely requires any individual efforts for its ongoing. But from another angle, life is composed more and more of these impersonal cultural elements and existing goods and values which seek to suppress peculiar personal interests and incomparabilities. As a result, in order that this most personal element be saved, extremities and peculiarities and individualizations must be produced and they must be over- exaggerated merely to be brought into the awareness even of the individual himself. The atrophy of individual culture through the hypertrophy of objective culture lies at the root of the bitter hatred which the preachers of the most extreme individualism, in the footsteps of Nietzsche, directed against the metropolis. But it is also the explanation of why indeed they are so passionately loved in the metropolis and indeed appear to its residents as the saviours of their unsatisfied yearnings.
 
 When both of these forms of individualism which are nourished by the quantitative relationships of the metropolis, i.e., individual independence and the elaboration of personal peculiarities, are examined with reference to their historical position, the metropolis attains an entirely new value and meaning in the world history of the spirit. The eighteenth century found the individual in the grip of powerful bonds which had become meaningless — bonds of a political, agrarian, guild and religious nature — delimitations which imposed upon the human being at the same time an unnatural form and for a long time an unjust inequality. In this situation arose the cry for freedom and equality — the belief in the full freedom of movement of the individual in all his social and intellectual relationships which would then permit the same noble essence to emerge equally from all individuals as Nature had placed it in them and as it had been distorted by social life and historical development [anarchism or liberalism?]. Alongside of this liberalistic ideal there grew up in the nineteenth century from Goethe and the Romantics, on the one hand, and from the economic division of labour on the other, the further tendency, namely, that individuals who had been liberated from their historical bonds sought now to distinguish themselves from one another [romanticism]. No longer was it the 'general human quality' in every individual hut rather his qualitative uniqueness and irreplaceability that now became the criteria of his value [creative economy]. In the conflict and shifting interpretations of these two ways of defining the position of the individual within the totality is to be found the external as well as the internal history of our time. It is the function of the metropolis to make a place for the conflict and for the attempts at unification of both of these in the sense that its own peculiar conditions have been revealed to us as the occasion and the stimulus for the development of both [todo: need to reread this more]. Thereby they attain a quite unique place, fruitful with an inexhaustible richness of meaning in the development of the mental life. They reveal themselves as one of those great historical structures in which conflicting life- embracing currents find themselves with equal legitimacy. Because of this, however, regardless of whether we are sympathetic or antipathetic with their individual expressions, they transcend the sphere in which a judge-like attitude on our part is appropriate. To the extent that such forces have been integrated, with the fleeting existence of a single cell, into the root as well as the crown of the totality of historical life to which we belong — it is our task not to complain or to condone but only to understand [ :) ]. 5894 2015-12-25 16:44:56 2015-12-25 21:44:56 open closed the-metropolis-and-mental-life publish 0 0 post 0 Action Communication Experience Humanities Metaphysics Mind and Matter Organization Personal Philosophy Psychology Semiotics Social Philosophy Urban Philosophy _edit_last 1 _wp_old_slug the-metropolis-and-mental-life-by-georg-simmel The Practice of Life http://rahilpatel.com/blog/the-practice-of-life Sun, 27 Dec 2015 15:40:32 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=5960 The theorization of humans and their environments* comes from the desire to understand how environments limit human development.

 a thought from a note written in Yilan:
 
 
 <blockquote>Back to the original goals — public space, city planning with tech, decision-making (Taizhong was quite interest because the problems were so clear), create tech from local materials (create art from local material combos), medicine, games for education?, progressive classes to teach (game, film, outside, media, family), politics, political media — film, cognitive science, social science.
 
 Perhaps will just have to observe east coast societies, determine what should be developed, ask government for money (to live and pay off debt), propose solutions (with tech), expose problems — in planning, culture, etc., join local organizations.
 
 Play with materials, craft, tech, space, play.</blockquote>

 <blockquote>There is one timeless way of building. It is a thousand years old, and the same today as it has ever been. The great traditional buildings of the past, the villages and tents and temples in which man feels at home, have always been made by people who were very close to the center of this way. It is not possible to make great buildings, or great towns, beautiful places, places where you feel yourself, places where you feel alive, except by following this way. And, as you will see, this way will lead anyone who looks for it to buildings which are themselves as ancient in their form, as the trees and hills, and as our faces are. - Christopher Alexander</blockquote>

 A building or a town will only be alive to the extent that it is governed by the timeless way,

 9. This quality in buildings and in towns cannot be made, but only generated, indirectly, by the ordinary actions of the people, just as a flower cannot be made, but only generated from the seed.

 1. Marker is not interested in politics (seemingly not of political philosophy / theory), he's only interested in how history shapes contemporary culture; Politics just happens to be a part of history [which often shapes contemporary culture]. [todo: may have to reread a few times more]
 
 2. The <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/hypomania">nomadic manic</a>.
 
 3.1. There was something I wanted to talk about here, about perception into form, especially the urban film-essay style of Chris Marker. Of putting together one's perception of reality into a film; That is, <strong>one's awareness of reality, the history and culture behind each image [and sound?]</strong>. [todo: <strong>should continue elaborating on the process from perception to film and perception of film as knowledge</strong>]
 
 Marker's form of film, the essay film, enables the director to bring out awareness of reality, to decipher reality. Through a standard realistic film one's mind accepts some unrealistic structures which form the film, despite the strong desire of the director to recreate social reality. When watching a direct cinema film (and to a great extent, cinema verite and documentaries), it is up to the viewer to extract knowledge from the film, to deconstruct it. Marker serves as the philosopher of his images, in addition to the selector of images. Anyone can deconstruct an image, but it requires a bit more skill to put philosophy-provoking images together in a beautiful manner.
 
 <strong>When one creates a documentary, wherein the camera-holder is the subject and the view of the camera is the object, reacting to reality, especially apparent in cities, one creates content which is closest in form to human perception.</strong>
 
 That kind of content could be quite useful to <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/the-metropolis-and-mental-life">environmental psychology</a>. If people simply had camcorders close to their eyes, one could gather a great amount of data useful for environmental design (urban design, etc.). Though, there may be a problem with treating humans like lab rats; Then again, <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/silicon-valley-and-capitalism">aren't cities just a rat race</a>?
 
 Still, even with the eye-level camcorder footage, it may not be as useful as Marker's films, because it lacks a smart subject who has intent to be aware of certain things, and make aware of more things from those things, which brings some order out of the information, [which though not required for an education, saves time,] and creates some direction. Though, at times, not much.
 
 3.2. Camcorder as a tool to give form to one's perception. Perhaps the greatest artistic tool because it produces <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/information-media-and-education">a form closest to reality</a>.
 
 3.3. Those who are best placed -- place in society, health, education, good perception, and mean of transport -- now have access to the camcorder.

 Recently I had some good conversations with a friend who grew up in rural areas in Taiwan, relied on media during her childhood, and describes her favorite time in life on a smaller island of Taiwan, Lanyu (蘭嶼).
 
 She showed me pictures of her time there. Her face, radiant.
 
 She taught kids at a school, usually art, sometimes reading, perhaps other things. It seemed as if the school gave her a great amount of freedom. She was able to create activities for the kids everyday, without much strain for normative education examinations. There were pictures of normative fine arts: painting, drawing, dancing. Furthermore, there were pictures of kids partaking in local cultural activities such as farming yams, fishing, cooking, swimming on the beach. Some related to the school, some not; She was fond of the fact that the kids would ask her for more activities after school. The social benefits were shared.
 
 She was also more creative. Though she doesn't have many outlets to show it through media, beyond the actions of the time, she did show me some pictures: a bookcase she created with found wood and string, natives performing festivals (dancing, cooking wild boar), local scenery, food she cooked, her roommates, her students.
 
 Most of her creativity hasn't been captured through media, lost in time and unrecorded, but it surely existed, through her actions. She taught, she had good roommates to share experiences with and talk to, she talked to local people, she had good students to help, she wandered and thought. She was <a href="https://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/philosophy/works/us/an-experience.htm">having an experience</a>. It's the highest form of creativity: action.
 
 Now, she describes herself as <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/two-phases-in-life">two people.</a> The normal her, and the abnormal her. The normal her is the one from the island -- the constantly acting, creative, often social, one. The abnormal her is the one seen right now as she works, restrained socially and economically, unable to act in the way she desires. She appears less creative, and unable to have an experience.
 
 Now, at times, her normal self appears. She sleeps less, does her work while listening to music, is more social, is consuming more (through media and reality), and is more willing to go out. She maximizes time for new experiences and minimizes time for old ones. She climbs mountains with alacrity, fishes for shrimp with great concentration, cooks with whatever ingredients she has available with haste, and manically opens a wine bottle with a knife. She is having an experience.

 [todo: the initial reason for the blog was to show the difference between poor creativity and instrumental creativity, how anarchy increases paths for creativity, and figuring out what makes an environment creative.]

 Her experience reminds me of the first time going to a city. Every moment was an experience.

 <blockquote>The heat is uncomfortable. It influences me to eat rather than exercise. Really need to control heat. - a thought during my three months in Taipei, scrap of paper</blockquote>
 
 
 paper 1:
 
 <blockquote>Perhaps a reason I failed during my time in Taiwan (this time) is because I have a belief: I can live off the community — gift economy, share food, share housing. the problem is when I want to go in my own direction (example: own housing), suddenly, it feels no one is there. It is difficult to ask friends for housing. Space is a commodity. Space is an incoming for tousim. It becomes a shame to ask for housing as it does to sleep in the public of a city. This, plus the inability to manage homeostasis without air conditioning (and a shower?) made it very difficult to live in Taipei.
 - this is the paradox
 - like Wall-E, I need that bit of organization, that space to hide from storms, exercise, and maintain health, and personal belongings.
 
 home vs homeostasis:
 I chose to find a house first, but I should have chosen to work first, then ask for sharing a house. But isn’t that the same as a shared apartment? I guess what I am against is the idea of owning land.
 ->
 And so I also had strong feelings to live on the east coast first. A place where I can maintain homeostasis and be myself. I just need air conditioner and space. Why is that so difficult, in a place with so many buildings? How many times was I asked or even in argument to be inside such a space?</blockquote>
 
 
 
 
 <blockquote>When people see me sleeping in a park, a bench, a playground, near an air conditioner, beneath a bridge, is there no compassion in the passerby’s, or do they think I enjoy it? Is my long hair not a sign of homelessness? Are there too many homeless people to worry about? There is little difference between a traveler and a homeless person in appearance. If I were a girl with a backpack, would it increase my chances of being helped? Is it because I am old? How do people know that I don’t know better? The helping hand has disappeared recently. Instead, it takes money.</blockquote>
 
 paper 2:
 
 
 <blockquote>1. I come with many ideas, ideas based on past positive experiences. This crashed in my face. I thought I could find a space and build a community, but the common view of space is that it has a cost - AirBnB, hostels, deny people without money. But if one explains the situation face to face, people understand*, and become more human. So, people assume that a person without money is useless to them, not giving a chance, especially when not physically proximal. There is an infinite amount of information in physical appearance and the way one communicates.*
 
 I failed to convey myself. If I showed my interest in the culture, people, being a part of society, their view of me becomes positive, and that is when hospitality comes. Perhaps they want something too; to learn via a physical social setting. But I cannot always think this way, I want to[?]
 
 There does seem to be a this waste of time talking, as opposed to doing, especially when compared to America / private sector society. People [here] just want to talk. More sociology, philosophy, etc., but no practical efforts to increase human survival, no practical art, no expression, burst of feeling. Perhaps they only write it down rationally, or with cute stickers.

 1. ? forgot

 <blockquote>
 Walking in the morning, my mind thinks, wanders. The space, the comfort, the lack of distraction, lack of social forces; I miss it. This freedom to think about the world, to not follow others — to create my own direction. Though, being social here, and forcing people / politics, I may one to the same problems*, once I am more aware.
 
 * I surely lost a lot of awareness of problems when I moved to the city. Cities are awful, especially in bad weather. It’s difficult to tay stable without trapping oneself in a small space.
 
 Luodong is very taiwanese, a great night market, streets / urban planning, more Taiwan culture than Taipei, even Taipei’s neighborhoods can’t replicate this feeling.* Cities feel like a different country.
 - old thought: New York is nothing like the rest of America.
 
 *I need the city because I need organizations toward art and science. It is one of the few places I can cooperate to help society. NGOs are another. Schools too. Medicine. City planning. It’s possible I feel less close to others outside of a city too. The urban planning is so spread out, or: I am failing to be social / productive to the community. Perhaps travel books helped me become aware of problems, and even gave knowledge of the world.
 
 But even when I travelled, many experiences were with knowledgable people — hostel owners, travelers, help exchange, organizations, university-educated kids. I still fail to teach.* I still fail to do things alone. I need the city because organizations toward certain things exist.
 
 I didn’t feel this way at first. Upon coming here I had plans to just be myself, and allow my direction to pervade to others. All that I blogged about — materials, technology, etc. To entice others to come to me — a public place. All i need to do was to express myself; and to do that *I wanted, not needed, my own space — not a library or hackerspace, my space, and from the public space to my private space.
 
 Need a Taiwanese roommate for Chinese practice / happiness, just be selective with social time? As I did in American cities? Really losing my ideals, ethics, to social forces. I need a home. The meeting Place was not bad, with fridges, clothes dryer, supermarket food, but too many social forces toward non-productive things — or perhaps I felt production in the past because my goal was to learn Chinese [and travel / explore], and I was also creating via Humans of Taipei.
 
 It now seems it may not be worth living outside of Taipei. J said he can find a place for 2000. that’s the absolute minimum. In taipei it may be between 4000-9000 for a room in a shared apartment or suite. What’s $100-200? I’d rather eat vegetables and rice, making better decisions on purchases. It simply is not worth living outside of Taipei. The cost only matters in getting space for a family to raise, or, living closer to nature.* Even here, space can be found in the public because the public is crime-free. A small residential park may be enough for the moment, but near a mountain / natural park would be much better. Is being 30 minutes away from nature wrong? Perhaps I feel this way because in College Park, nature began from my back yard. - a paper written in Yilan</blockquote>

None of these public acts matter if no one is around. I need the city. No act is useful in a society where the acts make no sense to the community. Work is needed in less developed societies, but I desire to do higher level work. It is not satisfying to do any less (of course I can learn from anything), but it feels better to be near my full capability. - a thought from a note written in Yilan</blockquote>

 The school is a conglomerate of old buildings, linked by social relations, with an urban planning department that fails to renovate itself to create spaces to increase the frequency of social interaction between departments and people. None are as chaotic as the city, as reality. One can derive, create so much with reality, experience as input. No one thinks as I have during my travels with my experience with fine art, media, technology, films, essayists, and so on.
 
 So then what is the point of school? Can it direct me toward progress? No, it would re-route my direction away from my own -- that's why I'm afraid of schools -- the directions, ideals, and methods of the school and of mine differ greatly. It doesn't fit. I need an open-ended school, to continue my own freedom of self-exploration and travel as those contemporary essayists have. Also, to create technology with local materials, for local development. I just don't feel school allows this; I have to force myself to live in reality, then communicate with the school to make them understand.
 
 Schools are only useful as a place of communication, not experience -- but why not use technology to communicate over a distance of space? Why place oneself in the same space? It is not needed. The place is excessive. Only the city is needed -- social networks exist digitally. Schools, like the library, are outdated urban forms, before communication technologies.
 
 Social networks within the city are contemporary schools. Schools are merely exclusive institutions where the bourgeoisie can [exclusively] communicate and maintain hegemony. When people use digital mediums to communicate, they maintain their own culture, yet are able to communicate to others, without sacrificing culture. This is why I dislike institutions -- they have a bourgeoisie culture, and I desire to stick to my own, which depends on the are I live in. I appreciate the culture I live in, yet, I also appreciate being able to communicate to those who may be a part of such an institution.
 
 Should I ignore anyone from such an institution? Isn't an institution created merely as a way to maintain certain directions under capitalism? Maybe I'm being too ideal, and forgetting that people close to the cultural norm use participate in institutions as a way to live; That is, a way to receive wealth.
 
 [todo: to be continued, as the original title of the though was school organizations vs city, to think about, perhaps compare how the school is organized compared to how a city is organized, and the processes between the two, favoring the natural process of the city] 6196 2016-03-10 01:44:01 2016-03-10 06:44:01 open closed school-vs-city publish 0 0 post 0 Applied Philosophy Communication Humanities Philosophy Philosophy of Education _edit_last 1 _yoast_wpseo_primary_category A Study Plan http://rahilpatel.com/blog/a-study-plan Wed, 02 Mar 2016 18:30:34 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=6302 Though entering an academic institution, especially an Asian one, is so bureaucratic that any sensible artist will be unwilling to complete it, there is one exercise that is useful: to express what one wants to study (in addition to <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/a-project-plan-for-an-urban-area">one wants to do</a>). This was written for the entrance to Asia's academia:
 
 #### Study Plan
 A note: I did not find any guidelines for this writing, so I will proceed to write without restriction.
 
 A disclaimer: Sometime ago I wrote my desired directions in life, then I fit it into relevant grants and institutions. Two writings encompass what I want to do and what I want to study which provide creative means toward desired social ends. I will reference them with "(m)" for MIT Media Lab graduate application and "(d)" for Taiwan Foundation for Democracy grant fellowship application. Though, I will try to avoid referencing them, and instead append them to the end of this writing.
 
 Project Plan:
 As I just mentioned, I've already written what I want to do in a grant application (see appendix 1) which asked for a "project plan". What I want to do remains unchanged, only the methods of study differ. The school did not ask for it, but it is probably more useful to read it instead of my study plan.
 
 Study Plan:
 This study plan merely complements my project plan. Ideally I would simply anything that relates to what I want to do, in sync with time.
 
 Perhaps what I want to study, or more precisely, what experiences in an academic space that I think could be beneficial to my desired plans, can be divided into these categories: theory, practice, reality, history, social relations, technology, and my social network.
 
 ##### Theory
 Theorizing is something I naturally do, often while experiencing, and sometimes while reflecting after an experience. How I've communicated those theories in the past varied through various arts. I hope that will never stop.
 
 Arguing (engaging in dialectic) with philosophers and theorists is a rare and optional part of my process of theorizing, that may occur after much experience. It is unnecessary, but in academia, it may be helpful to use the language of philosophers and theorists to communicate with people in academia. I think it would be nice to have conversations or even dialectics with people who are also interested, within the same space, leveraging the use of local or national cases as examples to the theories.
 
 Though I feel I could participate in much of the conversation that relates to human geography, urban planning, critical theory, new media, media studies, and more, yet, as I mentioned in my autobiography, I am quite afraid of encountering a bourgeoisie worldview usual of academia from my past personal experiences; I'm not sure how to cure this: Perhaps living in different areas and communicating through digital means, as opposed to being in the same space is one way. I also am unsure how talking to people within the same social class could ever lead to more understanding other people compared to simply living nomadic ally, changing area, work, and social relations. Or more simply, I am unsure how solely communication through human language between people could ever provide useful data. That, I guess, is something I may need to learn too.
 
 The first thing to study, especially at an academic institution, is the philosophy of social science. First the institution must try to persuade me into believing that their research, especially in the "social sciences", done in academia is worthwhile, or even functional. I want to see their methods of research. I want to see what separates my past essay-style writings, in which I create pure theory from personal experiences in reality, from academic "research" writings, which I imagine are peer-reviewed, and determine if that difference is worth the effort, compared to simply writing (or communicating through other mediums).
 
 Another thing to learn in the domain of research is how to obtain academic resources efficiently (Google Scholar?). How do researchers research (reality and primary sources?).
 
 Ultimately, Are there people able to create anything meaningful, especially compared to a film documentary? How does that information lead to practical urban and social interventions? Or are most social philosophy journals privatized, forgotten, into some impractical abyss? I have no idea. I've never spent time reading scholarly journals in my life. But as a person interested in humans (not natural sciences), is it even useful compared to experience?
 
 ##### Practice [of the institution]
 I simply desire to see the practice of people working within the field, so that I can judge the usefulness of the work myself [in my mind], and to compare it to my own personal practice [project plan].
 
 ##### Reality
 Although I've traveled and lived in several areas in Taiwan, simply continuing to live in several areas in Taiwan is an important part of my plan because it allows me to freely experience the material (urban) and social (cultural) reality.
 
 This brings about a stipulation: I cannot live in the space of an academic institution, and, hopefully I spend very little time there -- for the simple reason: only a few culturally and economically privileged people live in or around academic institutions. Living in different city neighborhoods is good, but I will also need to spend much time outside of the city to maintain an up-to-date mind mapping of the country.
 
 Perhaps to refresh my mind from the singular culture of Taiwan, I will desire to get out of Taiwan and experience a different, nearby society-nations (likely other islands in the Pacific and Southeast Asia) -- to help me compare societies with Taiwan, and to let go of habits and ideas ingrained in Taiwan's society.
 
 This constant shift between societies allows me to constantly compare societies, forcing my mind to think simultaneously more specifically and more abstractly, and is crucial to critically understand any society, including Taiwan.
 
 Contrary to reality and experience, I hope that the school will merely allow me space and time to communicate ideas with people, and to provide ideals and theories of other societies through academic readings, conversation, academic journals, film, and other relevant media.
 
 ##### History [and Culture]
 To understand contemporary urban and social reality, I may need to dig into history. Some social questions and concerns that have a cultural history are: lack of police enforcement, privilege of academia and its students, privilege of government, a history of social movements, a history of social and urban interventions.
 
 As for urban, I would simply like to learn how he built environment came to be, that is, who planned and who built everything, and why. Who is the Robert Moses of Taiwan? What percentage of do the government, academic planners, or those with abundant capital (individual to corporate) have in what is built?
 
 ##### [Local and National] Social Relations
 Although I've already spent quite some time in Taiwan, I've always had a difficult time connecting with any sort social or urban (especially the exclusive ones: academic, government, and national) organizations. I don't mind much as I am unwilling to join any top-down institution, yet, I still desire to understand the workings of contemporary policy, role of government (especially in urbanization), role of NGOs, role of private sector, and how nearly any political institution that is currently greatly influencing people's actions; I still desire to understand the social relationships between each organization.
 
 With this knowledge, organizations can be checked, at times down to the individual, and target them to take responsibility for their actions. Furthermore, this knowledge should be more readily available to the public, especially the civil society, through better media sources.
 
 Here I want to answer the questions: Who is responsible for road safety, road maintenance, illegal housing, squatters, homeless people, bad urban planning, wasteful urbanization, public health, and so on. With this knowledge, then I can better determine if e-government tools can be created or used to guide people to take more civil actions.
 
 ##### [Design, Art, Civics, and] Technology
 The final category of study comes closer to the Civic Media group from MIT Media Lab, which itself contains ideas from my design and technology past in New York. For more details see my study plan written for MIT Media Lab graduate application (appendix 2).
 
 Though I will be busy with urban planning and theory, a large part of my personal history involves technology, in education and work. Although I plan to spend less time on creating products, one form of creativity I gravitate toward is using material, especially combined with technology, as a means of aiding social and especially urban ends.
 
 I think it is always a good idea to play with current massively available technology (input devices [sensors], output devices, micro-controllers, etc.). This I believe was the gist of the creative process for new media art, and the core of Parson's D&T and NYU's ITP programs. Since my time in New York, I have always been associated with local public tech-oriented spaces (hackerspaces, fablabs, etc.) and artist co-living communities (communes, villages, etc.). I think I will always create some form of art, and this kind of new media in public spaces may fit as a means of social and urban solutions, placing information in the public, in reality, which could be really effective when the information contradicts the reality.
 
 Here, the experience with the environment is re-imagined. How can information be obtained from the environment? What, if any, should that be? How can the environment be enhanced by technology to guide people into better behaved (sustainable, ethical, altruistic) acts?
 
 Here, is the experience with people within their current space is re-imagined. What mobile or place-based technologies can be used to help people organize social events with civil ends? How can digital communication be organized to bring about civil actions?
 
 If the other categories are more academic, then part of this category encompasses my non-academic side: it is playful (I love games), disruptive (think Situationists), and just creative (think Fluxus). During this mode of thought, I do not care for the urban or the society; It's all silly old ideas; Instead, I ignore all old ideas and do what I want, re-using the environment as I wish, playing games on the streets.
 
 ##### My Social Network
 I am a product of public spaces, so it is likely I will in the future work with NGOs in Taiwan, and continue to affiliate myself with public spaces in the city: DIY spaces (Fablabs, Hackerspaces), venues with DIY ethics (free spaces, art spaces, community spaces), and more general public spaces.
 
 At NCKU specifically, I was happy to see that several departments (urban planning and creative industries included) were all within the same area: the northwestern bit of the large campus. This density of people and equipment is really what attracts me to the university, making it superior to even NTU.
 
 This structure makes me feel that I could easily go to industrial design department's workshop for rapid prototyping, walk to the urban planning department to talk about urban theories and design, walk to the architecture department to talk about experience within space, and then finally hang out in creative industries design, using it as the public space to communicate with anyone.
 
 Furthermore, the campus is simply in the heart of the city, which is odd considering the size of it, but a blessing. The reason I chose Parson's in my past is because it is in the heart of New York. This allows me to experience the city, maintaining social networks in the city, yet attend school.
 
 Though the structure of NCKU as long as it is private, it is useless to most, and out of personal ethics, I will try to utilize spaces in the city, as opposed to the institution, as much as possible.
 
 ##### Of Categorization
 Of course, all of this is merely a random categorization of my desires. In reality, I hope it's a chaotic mess of experience and information. 6302 2016-03-02 13:30:34 2016-03-02 18:30:34 open closed a-study-plan publish 0 0 post 0 Personal Self-assessment _yoast_wpseo_primary_category _edit_last 1 _oembed_a7e41003725e6fa094ea246452cd6d06 <blockquote data-secret="9odfFBqLWt" class="wp-embedded-content"><a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/portfolio">Things I&#8217;ve Made</a></blockquote><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" style="display:none;" src="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/portfolio/embed#?secret=9odfFBqLWt" data-secret="9odfFBqLWt" width="600" height="338" title="Embedded WordPress Post" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe> _oembed_time_a7e41003725e6fa094ea246452cd6d06 1459708567 Love and Equality http://rahilpatel.com/blog/love-and-equality Fri, 12 Feb 2016 00:30:43 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=6458 12/2
 Played with, or was played by a girl. What should I have done different? Should I have left her alone to talk with her friends through Facebook? Bring her water, ask if everything is okay, then leave? Yeah, probably. She would have been fine. Now there's the possibility I messed with our friendly relationship. We'll see tomorrow.
 
 Turns out I really suck at foreplay. Or, I have at least a little self-control, and decided not to do anything, which translates into being stuck, three-quarters-in-control one-quarter-play, allowing her to touch my face, never going beyond, and me only touching to hold her back. I could have at least practiced some play, at least show that I can play, so that she'd back off.
 
 Perhaps my non-commitment in life shows in relationships, and even in foreplay. I stay reserved, stoic, romantic. It's probably appears very unromantic.
 
 If I had money, was just traveling, would it be the same? No. I really wouldn't care for the person as much. I'd be interested in work, critical theory, helping people. I was caught (stuck) with this girl, because I really like her. I could have played much better if I didn't have my financial constraints.
 
 By I like her I mean she's a good person. Good, being that undefinable adjective used by Plato. She's good in the greatest sense of that word, and that's worth being around. Sometimes the rationality is just that simple. It's worth being around good people, and helping them.
 
 The reason she's stuck here is because of financial constraints. A seemingly male domination. When I saw what her boyfriend said, which he had previously and equally disgustingly said to his sister, I was as appalled as when I saw what my dad said to his servants in India. This feeling is almost the source [of driving force] of my life.
 
 She's much better, enjoys creativity, work, and fun; Her freedom is constrained. I adapted and socialized so much since I've been in Yilan, appreciating their simple and cheap lifestyle. Perhaps it's the critical part of me that attracts me. Knight helps a slave, to increase he freedom of another person. A simple rationality, despite my philosophic recent past. There's a potential that is lost, in her, in humans alike. And it is simply constrained by systems, economic or social, no different. It is unequal.
 
 God, she is the most beautiful girl I've met (maybe exaggerrated by current feelings). She has it all.
 
 The critical part is interesting though. How can a human be stuck with another human, without some kind of relationship, and when that relationship is dominant on one side, isn't it effectively inequality? When does it become dominant?* Did it start with domination? Don't males play male-dominating dating games with girls? What does an equal relationship look like? Aren't friends equals? Hence the difficulty of friends in relationships.
 
 Is it as simple as treating animals? Training females (and other slaves) like pets?
 
 Females can get jobs, so why not break and go with old friends, take a break, work elsewhere when one needs money.
 
 In this case, there is a long relationship, something that I do not have experience of, so very likely, I cannot empirically understand.
 
 I guess I will keep escaping inequality, and conversely, keep striving for equality.
 
 Perhaps this is why artists create so many things about love: because they get a strong feeling and have the desire to express it. My love seems to be more like Plato's, which I haven't read, but simply, a love for those undefinable traits: equality, freedom, good.
 
 I don't need a romantic (in the normative sense) human relationship to evoke that feeling, I've get enough of that from my nomadic lifestyle.
 But it's nice to know that romantic human relationships can evoke that feeling. 6458 2016-02-11 19:30:43 2016-02-12 00:30:43 open closed love-and-equality publish 0 0 post 0 Uncategorized _edit_last 1 _yoast_wpseo_primary_category Nostalgia of Romanticism at a 7-11 http://rahilpatel.com/blog/nostalgia-of-romanticism-at-a-7-11 Thu, 10 Mar 2016 07:21:43 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=6205 This thought was written the night before last at a 7-11 just outside of Taiwan's top university, my second day in Taipei alone, after slowly going around the country.
 
 Paper 1:
 The thoughts evoked from travel, observation lead me to create. I need to experience again. I need to take a scooter and just go, eating grains, camping, self-sufficiently, participating with NGOs, catching rural gigs along the way. I miss those times of travel, on the east, and northeast coasts of Taiwan, and even in northwest Thailand, and the train rides too. So peaceful, so happy. I was able ot think about towns, the entire country, the entirety of philosophy and history. I don't want to think of the city, at least, for the moment I don't. It [travel] allowed me to think, creatively, ideally, without culture, without influences of modern society, without communication, harking experiences of my own past, for example, how JRPGs were harked as I traveled through rural areas with their farm silos, factories, food vendors, farmers -- such beauty; I must go back. To again scooter and camp around Taiwan. No worries. A simple, undirected life. Anything else feels forced, against my desires. It's missing the freestyle essayist part of me. Modern society, including modern education, directs my thought away from reality. I must wander again. I want to be at peace again.
 
 Perhaps an hour passes at this 7-11, sitting, listening to a wonderful Japanese piano mix. It calms me. Allows me to think calmly. Rationally? Perhaps, perhaps not. But at least I can think, see beyond what's near. This is the peace that I desire. The time in Songshan (松山), at home, in Yilan (宜蘭), though isolated, not influenced by contemporary societies, were too, great times.
 
 Perhaps it is this kind of lone simple life that brings me happiness.
 
 Paper 2:
 Walk around Taiwan, especially small towns, asking for work / gigs, part-time and/or contract. Focus on natural, small towns. Be peaceful. Use phone to read and write, and, at times, make film essays. Wonder. Create. Freely. Need only enough money for another flight, and to pay back the petty things friends have paid for me.
 
 Can take a train from Taipei to the next small town. Or, I can walk through Taipei. I need to make a route to douliu, catching small towns, walking less through the lengthy roads in between, at least, until I pay my debts. I will need to rest, make a sign for hitchhiking, put things in my small backpack. Too hot? Too tiring? Maybe skip to a less humid area? Too cold? What about rain? If it's rainy and cold I have no chance.
 
 Learn to use 104 vs meet people physically during travels? Without hostels to help, is it possible? Try other websites? Then to Lanyu?
 
 Any job is possible with this peaceful state of mind -- slow mind, steady livin', steady work, no desire for change? Isn't that the suburban state of mind? A zombie even before modernity? I need more information, experience, reality -- the whole! Oh such is the paradoxical condition of post-modernity. 6205 2016-03-10 02:21:43 2016-03-10 07:21:43 open closed nostalgia-of-romanticism-at-a-7-11 publish 0 0 post 0 Personal Thoughts _edit_last 1 _wp_old_slug romanticism-at-a-7-11 _yoast_wpseo_primary_category Submitting to Capitalism http://rahilpatel.com/blog/submitting-to-capitalism Sat, 12 Mar 2016 04:43:33 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=6220 A thought written yesterday, or the day before:
 
 For once, I feel like accumulating a little capital to build a comfortable home, to survive the change in temperature, the winds, the walks, using the computer to communicate and to generate wealth a la programming. The public is harsh, abiding to their cultured ideas, unwilling to accept new ones. CouchSurfing, voluntary associations, and perhaps entire cities alike. I am best alone, comfortable. The time to actively understand the Other will reappear, but for now, I must survive, stockpile a few gold pieces for the next adventure.
 
 To organize.
 
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To dream beyond what's near.
 
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I actualize my dreams again.
 --
 
 from another paper, probably not too distant in time:
 <blockquote>What now? Live. Live again. Fuck trying to join these petty clubs. Do it all alone. With capitalism. *Do labor gigs.* *Move horizontally.* Use connections. Gather capital. *Keep connecting and doing.* Forget this direction for the moment and just do things. Create. Talk. Learn languages. Learn to forget. Change.

 The feeling of travel is so long ago. The experience. The creativity. It's been so long.

 Update:
 After writing this, maybe not. It seems to cost too much time. It feels like a chore. It's better to just keep on consuming an doing. Perhaps if I were able to automatically get my highlights and notes from the phone application into this blog post, I could continue to think [todo: ask Voice Dream app maker to do this]. Otherwise, the chore of transcribing exists, which is effing boring. I mean, reading is already boring enough! Besides, it's far closer to consumption than creativity. I'm in a really bad downer now, that's got the be the only reason I've transcribed all of this crap!

 Notes and longer thoughts from Chapter 3 from The Railway Journey: The Industrialization of Time and Space in the Nineteenth Century by Wolfgang Schivelbusch:
 
 First some longer thoughts:
 1.
 <strong>Railroad diminishes space at the speed of affordable transport.</strong>
 
 Therefore, any person with a connection to affordable transport cannot complain of development of life, can they? If people are able to move to a place with a better quality of life, they can simply just move.
 
 But what then about the social (and urban?) ties with the places they call home is strong? Then social progress will be difficult for them. They must rely on media as their primary source of education, as opposed to what exists in the society they live in.
 
 2.
 <blockquote><strong>The spaces in between are also not thought of.</strong></blockquote>
 
 In Banqiao, I met a family with three kids. One kid travels 50 minutes to get to his workplace by bus, one kid travels 40 minutes by subway to get to college, and one kid travels perhaps more than an hour to get home for the weekend from college.
 
 In the suburbs this is more obvious, as everyone drives cars on highways, during which nothing can be seen or experienced.
 
 3.
 <blockquote>The spaces in between are also not thought of.</blockquote>
 
 <strong>Now people explore things that are available by affordable transportation. What is publicly accessible becomes public knowledge.</strong> Outside of the affordable transportation system -- isolated prisons, aboriginals, ancient culturess, swaths of rural, suburban, and natural areas, and other isolated places where old cultural problems exist-- slavery, gangsters, prostitution, etc. -- but the media will never get to simply because it is inconvenient, and therefore ignored. So, <strong>in order to experience the spaces between, one needs personal transportation to travel outside the affordable transportation system, or else what is experienced is what is designed to be experienced by the transportation designers.</strong>
 
 What is publicly accessible becomes public knowledge.
 
 <strong>What can be accessed or experienced publicly, or at least affordably, also becomes the tools or space with and in which people create.</strong> "I recently visited an arts university, after being disappointed by their new media department's graduate student and public rooms, which were simply bland offices and computer labs. I then strolled over to the building next door: the crafts and design department. On the first floor they had a two wood workshops, on the second, a metal workshop, a jewelry workshop, and some other little workshops. <strong>My mind blazed with ideas which involved using them, and bringing friends and hanging out within the spaces.</strong>" (to thoughts.txt)
 
 So then, <strong>to make tools and <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/public-places">spaces public</a>, inclusive, results in more uses of those tools and spaces, and therefore more diversity in the people who use them, and therefore more creativity.</strong>
 
 4.
 from thoughts.txt:
 "I had an important thought: <strong>bad weather annihilates space in one's perception</strong>. When it is raining, only what within line of sight is experienced. Indoor areas become highlighted. Also, if one feels cold, then one feels the air less. When it is clear and sunny, everything has an equal opportunity of being experienced. Combined with view of a long distance, then the everything within that view becomes a playground for one's mind. The perception of space is altered greatly by weather."

 Now some highlights and all of the notes:
 
 <blockquote>
 (The scene behind the carriage window-panes
 Goes flitting past in furious flight; whole plains
 With streams and harvest-fields and trees and blue
 Are swalled by the whirlpool, whereinto
 The telegraph's slim pillars topple o'er.
 Whose wires look strangely like a music-score.)</blockquote>
 Probably where Michel Gondry got that idea for one of his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S43IwBF0uM">music video</a>s.
 
 <blockquote>"Economically, the railways' operation...causes distances to diminish...Lille suddenly finds itself transported to Louvres."...</blockquote>
 
 <blockquote>"'Annihilation of space and time.' was the early-nineteenth century characterization of the effect of railroad travel.</blockquote>
 
 <blockquote>
 "every man's field would be found not only where it always was, but as large as ever it was."</blockquote>
 The mind thinks in possible, accessible space. Inaccessible, exclusive spaces are not thought of.
 
 <blockquote>"Louvres, or Pontiose, Chartres, Arpajon, etc., it is obvious that they will just get lost in some street of Paris or its suburbs."</blockquote>
 The spaces in between are also not thought of.
 - [triggered larger thoughts written above.]
 
 <blockquote>"on the map of the imagination"</blockquote>
 
 <blockquote>"Transport technology is the material base of potentiality, and equally the material base of the traveler's space-time perception."</blockquote>
 potential is limited by transport.
 
 <blockquote>"If an essential elemenet of a given sociocultural space-time continuum undergoes change, this will affect the entire structure; our perception of space-time will also lose its accustomed orientaiton".</blockquote>
 orientation is shifted by change in socio-cultural perception of space-time
 
 <blockquote>"Space is killed by railways, and we are left with time alone..."</blockquote>
 time is measured, not space (distance)
 
 <blockquote>"I feel as if the mountains and forests of all countries were advancing on Paris."</blockquote>
 Mmmm.
 
 <blockquote>"We have clearly stated two contradictory sides of the same process: on tone hand, the railroad opened up new spaces that were not easily accessible before; on the other, it did so by destroying space between points."</blockquote>
 Summary thus far.
 
 <blockquote>"The railroad knows only points of departure and destination"..."They are of no use whatsoever for intervening spaces, which they traverse with disdain and provide only with a useless spectacle."</blockquote>
 Limit of railway transport compared with scooter. Scooter is also limited compared to walking.
 
 <blockquote>"They lost their old sense of local identity, formerly determined by the spaces between them."</blockquote>
 Mmmmm.
 - This is indeed how towns develop into clones, as opposed to unique societies. The more isolated a society is, the more unique it becomes.
 
 <blockquote>"...This was a common enough notion in the nineteenth century: it is to be found in every one of Baedeker's travel guides that recommends a certain railroad station as the point of departure for each excursion.
 
 The identification of the railroad station with the traveler's destination, and the relative insignificance of the journey itself were expressed by Mallarme..."</blockquote>
 - the problem of travel
 
 <blockquote>"the bringing of the product to the market...could more precisely be regarded as the transformation of the product into a commodity" - Marx, Grundisse</blockquote>
 Whether or not it's in a shop or digitally.
 
 <blockquote>"With the spatial distance that the product covered on its way from its place of production to the market, it also lost its local identity, its spatial presence. Its concretely sensual properties, which were experienced at the place of production as a result of the labor process (...), appeared quite different in the distance market-place."</blockquote>
 - fits better with upcoming Benjamin reference
 
 <blockquote>"Cherries offered for sale in the Paris market were seen as products of that market, just as Normandy seemed to be a product of the railroad that takes you there."</blockquote>
 Mmmm, great analogy.
 
 <blockquote>"...Benjamin's concept of the aura. He defined 'aura of natural objects' as 'the unique phenomenon of distance, however close it may be'."</blockquote>
 Whoa, beautiful. Place matters because that is where it was produced, by local material forces.
 
 <blockquote>"The aura of a work of art is 'its unique existence at the place where it happens to be."</blockquote>
 
 <blockquote>"It is tempting to apply this statement to the outlying regions that were made accessible by the railroad: while being opened up to tourism, they remained, initially at least, untouched by their physical actuality, but their easy, comfortable, and inexpensive accessibility robbed them of their previous value as remote and out-of-the-way places.
 ...
 The devaluation of outlying regions by their exploitation for mass tourism."</blockquote>
 
 [highlighted an example of England opening railways to seaside towns in which middle class took over, and the richer, airline travelers went to even further remote regions]
 
 <blockquote>"'The desire of contemporary masses to bring things <em>closer</em> spatially and humanly...is just as ardent as their bent toward overcoming the uniqueness of every reality by accepting its reproduction.'"</blockquote>
 *****
 - 5 stars for Benjamin, holy shit
 
 <blockquote>"When spatial distance is no longer experienced, the differences between original and reproduction diminish."</blockquote>
 - ooooh shit. Hello repeating development.
 
 <blockquote>"When, after the establishment of the Railway Clearing House, the companies decided to cooperate and form a national railroad network, Greenwich Time was introduced as the standard time, valid on all lines...In 1880, it became the standard time for England...In 1884 an international conference on time standards divided the world into time zones."</blockquote>

 [The degree of comfort needed to survive is about the same, depending on differences in bodies. Any more comfort is a luxury...]
 
 When the weather is uncomfortable, people seek comfortable spaces -- Asian convenient stores, cafes, libraries, public spaces, friends' dwellings, one's own dwelling, etc. (note: only two are inclusive spaces).
 
 When the weather is comfortable, then these comfortable spaces become unnecessary [my first thought, especially thinking of my comfortable travels in Asia as opposed to uncomfortable times in cold American cities]. They only seem useful in the habit of people meeting there, but that [habit] can be changed to meeting in a public outdoor spaces.
 
 [These comfortable spaces are a huge market, from daycare to hip places to elderly care...]
 
 People with jobs which require their body to move through uncomfortable weather are targeted (and screwed) by capitalist designers [my second thought, thinking of migrant workers in Taiwan consuming junk at railway stations at high costs]. Transport stations, roadside convenient stores, and roadside restaurants, are utilized as a means of survival, but taken advantage of with high costs.
 
 Instead of construction workers being provided with a nice room with a water cooler, refreshments, a clean bathroom, air conditioner, such that would be found in an office, then it is up to the convenient store to provide these comforts. But the convenient store, unlike than office space, or a space in one's own dwelling (remote and home workers), is filled with mass-produced, high-priced, often useless commodities.&nbsp;
 
 [There is quite a difference in the experience of a convenient store in Taiwan and one in America...]
 
 [todo: continue?]
 
 Hmmm, well that was the thought: that programmers at home can work and save comfortably because their bodies are at home, whereas the postal workers that bring them their commodities, must efficiently find ways to survive -- pack lunch, pack coffee, find free hot or cold water, use air conditioned vehicle, etc. --, or suffer the cost, in addition to the fact that a programmer's salary is higher than a postal worker's.
 
 This thought was probably initiated by CouchSurfing with a person who's job is technical support, and who works comfortably in his well-stocked apartment in a high-rise in he middle of nowhere. &nbsp;One can probably even see the from the window of his apartment, looking down at the people struggle against the weather.
 
 [insert Veidt comic frame?]
 
 [rename to to comfort as commodity?

To simple be with another person in their everyday life, is to be effected by the same urban and social influences of everyday life. This is something that can be experienced. Live through the shift of a subway repairman, a farmer, an office worker, an at-home technical support worker, a housewife, a maid, a baker, and one will, in addition to appreciate people more, understand the social and material forces at work. <strong>This is all we can understand.</strong></p>
 
 <p>Then, to gain an understanding of several people, one must alternate between living the lives of others &#8211; their work and their social relations. The greater the amount and diversity of lives experienced, the better on&#8217;s perception of social reality is. <strong>This is a method of understanding</strong>, but it is temporary, because memory is.</p>
 
 <p>Then, retaining the memory of the experiences with people, one must create something that would be beneficial to the greatest amount and diversity of people,.</p>
 
 <p>Then, one should repeat the process [of experiencing and creating]. <strong>This is the way of building a more inclusive society and environment</strong>.

 Found these related bits during a random reading today of Russell's History of Western Philosophy:
 <blockquote>"Until philosophers are kings, or the kings and princes of this world have the spirit and power of philosophy, and political greatness and wisdom meet in one, and those commoner natures who pursue either to the exclusion of the other are compelled to stand aside, cities will never have rest from their evils, nor the human race, as I believe, and then only will this our State have a possibility of life and behold the light of day." - Plato, Republic</blockquote>
 Famous quote, but one usually focuses on the preposition, overlooking the exclusion bit.
 
 
 <blockquote>"democracy, in the proper sense of the word, is of necessity despotism, because it establishes an executive power, since all decree regarding – and, if need be, against – any individual who dissents from them."
 
 "the "whole people", so-called, who carry their measure are really not all, but only a majority: so that here the universal will is in contradiction with itself and with the principle of freedom."
 - Kant, Perpetual Peace</blockquote>
 
 Hmmm, exclusion must be on my mind because that's all I currently see and seek.

 From the beginning, I always wrote down my thoughts and notes into a text file titled <em>thoughts</em>. Later, I created a <em>knowledge and education</em> text file to separate my notes from my thoughts; Mainly, because I read and "highlighted" (copy text) huge amounts of text from Wikipedia. During the beginning of my philosophic period, and likely because it began with the audio of a series of lectures, I began highlighting (from audio to text), taking notes, and engaging in dialectic (without knowing the word) in separate text files on my phone through Byword (now I more frequently use Writebox). Later, these text files went under <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ksbu886d6snglv6/AADJMox8Z50iGqe_joIYzX1ka?dl=">a folder titled <em>knowledge and education</em></a>. Even later, my notes on other media -- physical books, documentaries, films, real conversations, real experiences -- were all created in their own separate text files. During the middle of my philosophic period, I discovered Voice Dream, and now my highlights and notes are stuck inside the application. Still, I use the <em>knowledge and education</em> text file and folder for all other kinds of media and real experiences.
 
 Then I figured, there's probably some useful things I said in my notes that I could scavenge. Alas, there's never time to look back and organize it all, is there?

 <blockquote>"...The second essay is about whether 'personal essays' ever cause action: has anyone acted upon an <em>Essai</em> by Montaigne[?], as people acted when Blow made <em>Braid</em>, or when Vertov made <em>Man with a Movie Camera</em>? Did the games and films made in response [to them] merely create more communication, as opposed to action? No [and Yes?]. It's the accessibility of the medium that increases the chance of acting in response. 'I read the news today' is a different experience from watching <em>Night and Fog</em>, and that itself different from what I imagine and hope the experience of playing <em>This War of Mine</em>. The closer the experience of a medium is to real experience, the greater the chance of acting in response."</blockquote>

 When one physically sees the masses that move across streets in large cities -- New York, Seoul, Taipei, and especially <strong>Tokyo</strong> -- one wonders, why are they walking to their destination? Are they thinking? Are they human, or zombies? Is their mind separated from their body? Must one use music to stop thinking in order to move the body?

 The body needs to be somewhere at a certain time. But with current technology, is it necessary for many jobs? Why not simply communicate through digital means?

 [<strong>Singapore</strong> and <strong>Hong Kong</strong>: Asia's businesses cities. Let's not talk about them please. I could only stand half a day in Singapore, and I was happy to purchase a flight out of Hong Kong as soon as possible.]
 
 In <strong>Seoul</strong>, one really gets a strong sense of capitalistic behavior. That, the economic system is almost in entire control of the society. That nobody is thinking about their actions. The entire society blindly follows <strong>what capital wants</strong>. If capital wants technology, that is what they will give it (hence the economic boom). <strong>Capitalism determines the actions of all its citizens from professional business to art to everyday life</strong>. The way shopping malls (thinking of <a href="http://rickroderick.org/category/philosophy-and-human-values/">Rick Roderick's Philosophy and Human Values</a>) determine where people go and what they buy, the entire city is planned to control Seoulites position and advertise their feeble minds to purchase commodities. A good dungeon master or game developer could easily create the material structure and rules for them to follow. (Unfortunately, the masters are boring, rich capitalists.) <strong>Capitalism determines their place in society</strong>. If capital values exchange-value, that is what society values. A higher salary actually is valued in this society. Go figure.
 
 In <strong>Tokyo</strong>, the capitalistic behavior pervades, but perhaps is weaker in some parts. Of work, it is the same as Seoul: the old bergousie wealth culture, mannerism still exist. But it doesn't extend to entertainment, or their everyday life after work. They have unique arts, though, itself extremely insular. When they have free time, they don't go to malls (well, many do), but they might actually go home and play some video games, or actually go to a park.
 
 In <strong>Taiwan</strong>, the capitalist behavior is the weakest [of East Asia], hence the lack of economic boom. Somewhere in the culture (Confucius?, benevolence is prioritized over 'profit'?) having <em>an experience</em> (a la Dewey) at a good price is prioritized. Every experience is calculated, from snacks to flights. Thus, perhaps, going to Thailand is better than going to a developed country, because there is more experience in Thailand. <strong>Maximizing experience is the categorical imperative.</strong> Strive to make every action a social experience. Try anything. Nothing is looked down upon, instead people <em>cheer</em> you on (加油). It doesn't matter what the direction is, therefore, capital does not affect their actions; It doesn't matter if an action generates capital or not; Just do it for the experience. Go on, <em>try</em> (试试看) riding a skateboard, or hunting wild boars with aboriginals. Who cares. If one fails (which is pathetically often the case), oh well. It was worth trying; <strong>It was worth the experience of trying</strong>. If one runs out of capital, well, one must <em>work</em> (工作) for it, it's one's <em>duty</em> (负责). Playtime (玩) is over. But surely after work, maybe even during work, and after saving a little, one can play again. Thus, <strong>capital here is merely something needed in order to try things, to take actions in desired, natural directions</strong>. Those directions could be to have an experience (try something new: food, travel, art), urbanize a <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/creating-comfortable-places">comfortable place</a>, or volunteer to try <em>to do good</em> (热情) for one's society. <strong>Capitalism limits behavior, but only for the time necessary to earn capital.</strong>

 [applies to all] Work and play. Work hard, play hard. Life is separated from work. Work is completely alienated. One goes into some work zone, physical and mental, then comes out 8 hours later, then proceeds to a social space, a bar, a cafe, an event, home, etc, to not think about work again. Because the wages are so high, benevolent thoughts, politics, society, are not thought of. One doesn't need to think about how to create a better society, because one is already surviving quite well off.
 
 In Virginia, the suburbs of which I've come from, corporations have nearly defeated all small businesses and replaced them with superstores which contain a million commodities, which makes it impossible to imagine the labor that went behind it all. Industrialization is in full force in the suburbs. Cashiers are automated now. So is security. Go on, get your manufactured milk and cereal and check 'em out yourself!
 
 The work in Virginia is either corporate or government, the latter, having a large military presence. Do the engineering for some part of some battleship or spacecraft or secret intelligence program. They're huge enterprises, and the work is a tiny cog (todo: link to Helplessness Blues). My school spit out cogs for SPAWAR, NAVSEA, NASA, and DARPA. But somehow, <strong>no student saw the simple ends: war, wasting capital toward positive science, and building an Orwellian society. That's the American education.</strong> Hurray science! Use a STEM-pack. Ah yeah, that's the stuff!

After reading a few books, it led to <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/language-and-experience">this thought</a>.
 
 28. Chinese Philosophy in the Modern World (last chapter)
 end (the methodology of metaphysics):
 <blockquote>"I maintain that there are two methods, the positive and the negative. The essence of the positive method is to talk about the object of metaphysics which is the subject of its inquiry; the essence of the negative method is not to talk about it. By so doing, the negative method reveals certain aspects of the nature of that something, namely those aspects that are not susceptible to positive description and analysis."</blockquote>
 
 <blockquote>"...the West started with what he [Northrop] calls the concept of postulation, whereas the Chinese philosophy started with what he calls concept by intuition. As a result, Western philosophy has naturally been dominated by the positive method, and Chinese philosophy by the negative one. This is espeically true of Taoism, which started and ended with the undifferentiable whole. In the Laozi and Zhuangzi, one does not learn what the Tao actually is, but only what it is not. But if one knows what it is not, one gets some idea of what it is."</blockquote>
 - sounds like a research programme by Lakatos, which is from 1976!
 
 <blockquote>"...Ch'anism, which I would like to call a philosophy of silence. If one understands and realizes the meaning and significance of silence, one gains something of the object of metaphysics."</blockquote>
 - perhaps there's something he's getting at here, that Chinese Philosophy tries to focus on actuality, not language. Where western philosophy focused on creating ideas in the form of words, and even later, a terrible linguistic turn, Chinese philosophy maintains a better perception of reality, but simply cannot communicate much about it, at least, not through written language.
 
 <blockquote>"In the West, Kant may be have said to use the negative method of metaphysics...he found the unknowable, the noumenon. To Kant and other Western philosophers, because the unknowable is unknowable, one can therefore say nothing about it, and so it is better to abandon metaphysics entirely and stop at epistemology. But to those who are accustomed to the negative method, it is taken for granted that, since the unknowable is unknowable , we should say nothing about it. t和business of metaphysics is not to say something about the unknowable, but only to say something about the fact that the unknowable is unknowable. When one knows that the unknowable is unknowable, one does know, after all, something about it. On this point, Kant did a great deal."</blockquote>
 
 <blockquote>
 ”...A perfect metaphysical system should start with the positive method and end with the negative one. If it does not end with a negative method, it fails to reach the final climax of philosophy (~earlier he mentioned how Western philosophers usually use words like Good, God, Love denoting the end of their philosophy and the beginning of their metaphysics). But if it does not start with the positive method, it lacks clear thinking that is essential for philosophy.“</blockquote>
 - isn't this Hegel's triad idea?
 
 <blockquote>[Ch'an [Zen?] story of thumb being cut off and enlightened is referenced.] ”Whether this story is true or not, it suggest that the truth that before the negative method is used, the philosopher or student of philosophy must pass through the positive method, and before the simplicity of philosophy is reached, he must pass through its complexity.“</blockquote>
 - perhaps what is meant is teaching should not involve any positive direction, people should arrive at it on their own. Do not en-culture or indoctrinate students.
 
 <blockquote>
 "One must speak very much before one keeps silent.”</blockquote>
 - similar to "Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent." by Wittgenstein 6376 2016-04-17 04:53:11 2016-04-17 08:53:11 open closed positive-and-negative-methodologies publish 0 0 post 0 Eastern Philosophy Epistemology Humanities Metaphysics Philosophy _edit_last 1 _yoast_wpseo_primary_category 177 medium_post O:11:"Medium_Post":11:{s:16:"author_image_url";s:74:"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/200/200/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png";s:10:"author_url";s:28:"https://medium.com/@rahil627";s:11:"byline_name";N;s:12:"byline_email";N;s:10:"cross_link";s:2:"no";s:2:"id";s:12:"39f94131d638";s:21:"follower_notification";s:3:"yes";s:7:"license";s:19:"all-rights-reserved";s:14:"publication_id";s:2:"-1";s:6:"status";s:6:"public";s:3:"url";s:77:"https://medium.com/@rahil627/positive-and-negative-methodologies-39f94131d638";} Language and Decision-making http://rahilpatel.com/blog/language-and-decision-making Mon, 18 Apr 2016 04:32:12 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=6380 And it seems again that I’ve hit the limits of [human language] communication. Previously it was with the society I lived in, but now it’s with media: books, the most abundunt resource of communication. Language is too narrow in scope, leading the mind to more narrower things. The entirety of the philosophy bookshelf of the library seemed quite useless, probably because its Western philosophy: the categorization of reality. Instead of offering reality, cities, societies, nature, it only contained words describing bits of it. Political questions are great to ponder about, but the words lack the reality of thr environment. There is simply no way for words to offer a real experience. It is only in the mind of an active nomad that thr words provoke recent experiences, entire towns, countries. And for that, then fewer words are needed: poetry and Calvino are enough. [Wittgenstein comes close to creating a poetic dialectic, within the written language medium.] But that’s directionless, anti-dialectic. Well, then, <strong>don’t read. Just consume reality and film, then create from it, because there will never be anyone communicating the things I think about.</strong>
 
 The content of communication (or any creative action) is unique. [todo: remove or add more to this thought]
 
 I've spent so much time [and energy] in my life trying to find, through contemporary people and mediums, people to talk certain ideas about, to share, to socialize, but alas, <b>there was no point [of searching] to begin with.</b> One should not have to go to a human geography department to talk about how capitalism reproduces exclusive spaces. Yet, one cannot simply expect one's neighbors or friends to have thought of these things. <b>One can only hope the neighbor or friend is willing to spend some time to talk</b>. That is the [socially] normal scenario; Desiring more [<strong>energy</strong> from others], as I always do, is ideal, and leads to failure.
 
 Why seek to communicate? Why not simply do as I feel? [1.] It's not social, therefore, it does not feel good. [2.] Communication [sometimes] leads to more knowledge [through dialectic]. [3.] Making decisions for actions via a mutual consensus provides a sense of social verification.
 
 These might be alleviated: [1.] I can make what I do social, simply by having a social network, or even more simply, people around. [2.] Communication can be received through media. Although not ideal, it's more efficient. [3.] Can't be fixed; People with knowledge are needed to provide input in the decision-making process.
 
 But when the entirety of society is ignorant, then there are simply two [positive] paths: <strong>do things myself and/or [forcefully?] bring others to do these things with me</strong>. Skip the consensus.
 
 [todo: compare Confucius / Socrates / Bacon and Zhuangzi / Heraclitus / Montaigne lives, which is better? Living in the city, constantly fighting [arguing] to push society toward ideal vs living as a hermit, thinking and creating freely [whether or not society listens or argues]? Compare the outcomes of my personal experience when living in those two modes. What was most effective? Individual communication, group communication through social organizations in the city, or mediated communication through various mediums (essays)? Or a combination of all? Which mode was healthier, happier? Read <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/anchors-famous-nomads-and-the-ideal-nomadic-lifestyle">my old post about ideal lifestyles</a>]
 
 The verification, justification of social behavior comes with experience. I don't know what I was doing when I first created anything: games, photo essays, written philosophy, work, travel, event organizing, social organizing. It was all nerve-wrecking. First, because, all of these things went against <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/capitalistic-behavior">capitalistic behavior</a>. They were feelings, impulses acted upon. Second, because there are infinite things one can always do, and being conscious of this, constantly thinking and choosing what to do results in a roller-coaster of decisions and emotions.
 
 
 [possible quotes:
 
 After "It's not social, therefore, it does not feel good":
 <blockquote>First of all: what is work? Work is of two kinds: first, altering the position of matter at or near the earth's surface relatively to other such matter; second, telling other people to do so. The first kind is unpleasant and ill paid; the second is pleasant and highly paid.
 <cite>Bertrand Russell, "In Praise of Idleness"</cite></blockquote>
 
 <blockquote>Democritus and Heraclitus were two philosophers, of whom the first, finding the condition of man vain and ridiculous, never went out in public but with a mocking and laughing face; whereas Heraclitus, having pity and compassion on this same condition of ours, wore a face perpetually sad, and eyes filled with tears. I prefer the first humor; not because it is pleasanter to laugh than to weep, but because it is more disdainful, and condemns us more than the other; and it seems to me that we can never be despised as much as we deserve. Pity and commiseration are mingled with some esteem for the thing we pity; the things we laugh at we consider worthless. I do not think there is as much unhappiness in us as vanity, nor as much malice as stupidity. We are not so full of evil as of inanity; we are not as wretched as we are worthless.
 <cite>Michel de Montaigne, "On Democritus and Heraclitus"</cite></blockquote>

 [cut:
 Individual communication was best during travel, meeting and talking to people wherever I went.
 
 Only in New York was I able to even achieve a good level of group communication and come to multiple mutual consensuses. Oh so much to do, as opposed to deciding what to do.
 
 My apex of mediated communication was during my time living abroad, especially in Taipei during Humans of Taipei and in solitude (in Taipei, home, Yilan) after travels reading and writing philosophy. The second form is detached from society, perhaps because it involved reading. One should never read, just create (writing is okay, but the worst form).
 
 The ideal, it seems, was the second, group communication. To be part of multiple social organizations which directly affect society, because media has its limits in affecting society [link].
 
 The most creative is mediated communication. One can freely explore and drift wherever one desires, talking about anything via essays.

 Also can look at my previous history of how <strong>this is my categorical imperative</strong>, especially dependent on place: I move to a place and try to do good within the society. For example, I may stumble upon a city and try to improve the urban planning, or homeless people, or I may stumble upon a bunch of Burmese refugees and join a nearby social organization to try to improve the situation. But also how joining these organizations (especially anything large) are never satisfying because one must spend much time communicating, as opposed to doing, which leads (and isolates) me to take on more direct actions: personal art, media, urban and social interventions
 
 This, with <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/capitalistic-behavior">Capitalistic Behavior</a> may become one of my largest posts, because it should contain my personal history (including experience), the ideal, the practical, and more.]
 
 When I stumble upon a human settlement, I should have the ability to see problems or spaces for improvement and then implement the solution, which, especially of it involves society, may require others through social organizing, and through communication come to a consensus to take the necessary actions. That is <em>the ideal work</em>.
 
 <blockquote>Politics [political philosophy] is the study of ideal social organization.
 <cite>Will Durant, The Story of Philosophy</cite></blockquote>
 
 <strong>Politics then should be the practice of actualizing the ideal social organization.</strong> And I don't mean a revolution. "<em>Don't get any big ideas</em>". Every tiny step counts.
 --
 
 It is during this kind of work, this state of mind, <strong>ideas, <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/valuable-things-ive-written#future">practical</a> and <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/valuable-things-ive-written#ideals">theoretical</a>, to improve society will form in the mind. This process <em>is</em> <em>social progress</em>.</strong>
 --
 
 As long as I begin the ideal work as an individual, I am not afflicted by the cultures (capitalism, social customs, the economic status of the others, the knowledge of the others). The danger begins once I interact with another to engage in political actions. I have to continually argue until the actions passes through.
 --
 
 group decision-making vs not (via capitalism):
 
 Without capitalism, this would be far more smoother. With it, then I must either invest in myself, have other invest in the consensual action (a group of individuals pay), throw it on a crowd-sourcing platform (the public pays), ask government for a grant (public sector pays), or ask a capitalist for funding (private sector, venture capitalist pays).
 
 When considering the time it takes to argue, to rationalize actions, make group decisions, nothing would ever get done, just science and government get nothing done; It is a bureaucratic dystopia. Artists and people who get shit done simply do not have the time to argue in this old-fashioned way. Instead, it's done in lightning speed in the city, through the multiple methods of communication now available.
 
 Hence, capitalism here, allows people to take actions without verification. In doing so, it creates a wildly uneven world. But as a person who wants to get shit done, because <em>it must</em>, then <strong>individually accumulating capital and then using it to fund my unverified actions appears to be the better path, because it is time-efficient</strong>.
 
 <strong>Arguing against institutions is a waste of time.</strong> The amount of cultural problems within them, and the time to educate them on their problems are infinite. <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/language-and-decision-making">One [a single individual] cannot argue against every institution. Instead one must leave it to media which highlights their problems, or some other method of educating them</a> At least, that's the nice way.
 --
 
 How would people behave without capitalism? Would it be benevolent? Would that require some education in ethics? Without capital, then everyone must constantly make group decisions, or, it could turn into anarchy. Then, a common ethical foundation, which is then reproduced through culture, would be the only thing that keeps the society together.

 [Written after biking to day markets for a day in Taipei, itself after bike commuting for several days.]
 
 <strong>Noisy transportation ruins the [social] atmosphere around it.</strong> Wherever there is noisy transportation (petroleum-powered motorcycles and cars), the space around it, in which sound can permeate, is destroyed.
 
 <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/creating-comfortable-places">The body seeks <em>comfortable spaces</em></a>. A place where once can sit, talk, and drink some tea. [todo: needs more thinking?]
 
 <h2>in Taipei</h2>
 All of the streets are a terrible place to be. It is only there to pass by. One way to avoid some of the noise and get by is to take a bus. Another, the subway (but that’s another problem [todo: how subways ignore space]). Walking [todo: urban problems of walking], biking [todo: urban problems of biking], and motorcycling creates a thoughtless, uncomfortable experience that <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/transportation-disrupts-sense-of-space">disrupts one's sense of space</a>.
 
 When one is stuck on a noisy street, then <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/creating-comfortable-places">an <em>exclusive comfortable place</em></a> is a likely, deterministic choice, such as a convenient store or cafe.
 
 One way to ignore all of it is to wear earplugs or headphones. But to ignore space, similar to when one drives an enclosed vehicle, is a dangerous choice, as exemplified by how the suburbs have developed without care for <em>the space between</em>.
 
 The most comfortable (public) outdoor areas are in <em>dense neighborhoods</em>, where buildings are built close to each other, split by <strong><em>narrow streets</em> in which only a few vehicles can pass by at a time.</strong>
 
 This is exemplified by some of the densest neighborhoods in Taipei [台北] (including New Taipei [新北]). The neighborhood around Tonghua street (通化街), the neighborhood west of Taida (太大), south / southeast Songshan (松山), perhaps Datong (大同), and perhaps Shuanghe (雙和).
 
 <strong>The day and night markets provide further comfort by nearly blocking vehicular traffic.</strong>
 
 <strong>The more people on the street, the more comfortable the space, and less likely that vehicles will try to break through.</strong>
 
 So, it seems, <strong>the urban solution is to build narrow streets which attract people [to be on the street], resulting in <em>filled narrow streets</em>.</strong>
 
 <h2>Neighborhoods in Taipei</h2>
 Tonghua is the best neighborhood in Taipei because it has a by-foot-accessible day and night market that nearly blocks all vehicles. It seems the vehicles that do make it in are those that belong to the market workers. The rest of the neighborhood consists of the typical <em>3–5 story buildings</em>, <em>small neighborhood parks</em>, <em>small neighborhood temples</em>, and so on. It’s streets seem to be quite <em>irregular</em>, making it even more difficult or undesirable to pass through. It effectively blocks vehicular traffic.
 
 The southeastern part of Songshan District is also great. 3–5 story buildings in a simple grid for a larger area. A day market on the east. A night market further north. Traffic permeates better, especially on larger streets, at the cost of noise.
 
 All good neighborhoods in Taipei have these characteristics[: <em>3–5 story buildings, narrow streets, filled narrow streets (markets), small neighborhood parks, small neighborhood temples, irregular streets</em>].
 
 <h2>Connecting the good neighborhoods</h2>
 The problem is simply the transportation between the areas: the uncomfortableness of getting to each one. To get to Songshan, one must traverse through the commercial belt, similar to Midtown in Manhatten. It is a terrible experience, ruining the <em>sense of home</em>. Instead of feeling as if one is simply going to a friend’s dwelling in a neighborhood, it feels as if one has to traverse through some annoying alien world to reach it.
 
 <strong>The goal then is to figure out how to provide <em>comfortable routes</em> between residential areas.</strong> How can one comfortably get to Songshan from Daan? <strong><em>Bike and pedestrian routes</em> through smaller streets</strong> is one method.
 
 Currently the best bike routes merely are aligned with the most commercial streets, the red and blue lines. They don’t appear to go anywhere useful in itself. They require <em>[bike] tributaries</em>. There must be signs at each tributary, as there are exit signs near ramps on a highway. The red and blue lines are <em>bike highways</em> without exits.
 
 <strong>Without comfortable routes, one becomes isolated in one’s neighborhood, not wanting to leave it, which is good and bad: good to develop a home, bad being unable to traverse [between], diversify, and melt [with] others' homes.</strong>
 
 <h2>Design Patterns?</h2>
 I've only got through the intro and first few chapters of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_language">A Pattern Language</a>, but once I began adding emphasis to words, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_pattern"><em>design patterns</em></a> clearly began to emerge. Although it seems natural for it to occur, is it right to implement design patterns from my experience? These are not universal design patterns. Therefore, wouldn't that destroy space, as it may conflict with another's design patterns? Doesn't environmental design always destroy the space by altering it?
 
 <blockquote>When these patterns are taken together, the authors say, they begin to form a kind of language, each pattern forming a word or thought of a true language rather than being a prescriptive way to design or solve a problem. As the authors write on p xiii, "Each solution is stated in such a way that it gives the essential field of relationships needed to solve the problem, but in a very general and abstract way—so that you can solve the problem for yourself, in your own way, by adapting it to your preferences, and the local conditions at the place where you are making it.
 <cite><em>Wikipedia</em>, Christopher Alexander and colleagues, <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Pattern_Language"><em>A Pattern Language</em></a></cite></blockquote>
 
 So it seems as long as the ideas are general, abstract, one can avoid specific design, and therefore avoid destruction of space from repetition. The set of ideas merely exist as a toolset to hypothetically solve problems that can be solved by altering urban material.

There is no thought about the space between, just as there is no thought between one’s location and destination in a car in the suburbs. <strong>This <em>lack of sense of space</em> is what ruins space. In other words, the lack of awareness of the space around one’s self, the material and the people, is what leads to the ruin of the material and the people within it.</strong>
 
 <strong>To walk is to care for the space and people around.</strong> The space and the people within it aren’t skipped over. One can interact with both. One feels [as if one is] a part of both. <strong>The choice of walking through a slum or driving through it is a <em>choice of care</em></strong>: does one care for the space of the slum or not?
 
 <strong><em>Care</em>, for me, is directly correlated with <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/the-distance-between-humans"><em>the distance between humans</em></a>.</strong> <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/will-to-take-care-of-locality">If I am within the same space as humans, I care for them</a>. It is that simple for me. Therefore, care depends on position in space, and the routines of everyday life that alter one’s position. I am aware this is an abnormal psychology, but I believe there is some truth in this. 6573 2016-04-30 21:54:13 2016-05-01 01:54:13 open closed transportation-disrupts-sense-of-space publish 0 0 post 0 Design Environmental Design Humanities Philosophy Urban Philosophy _edit_last 1 _yoast_wpseo_primary_category 167 medium_post O:11:"Medium_Post":11:{s:16:"author_image_url";s:74:"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/200/200/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png";s:10:"author_url";s:28:"https://medium.com/@rahil627";s:11:"byline_name";N;s:12:"byline_email";N;s:10:"cross_link";s:2:"no";s:2:"id";s:11:"6c07d750bd1";s:21:"follower_notification";s:3:"yes";s:7:"license";s:19:"all-rights-reserved";s:14:"publication_id";s:2:"-1";s:6:"status";s:6:"public";s:3:"url";s:79:"https://medium.com/@rahil627/transportation-disrupts-sense-of-space-6c07d750bd1";} バケモノの子 (The Boy and the Beast) http://rahilpatel.com/blog/the-boy-and-the-beast Tue, 03 May 2016 17:27:24 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=6670 After The Boy and The Beast (Japanese: バケモノの子, Hepburn: Bakemono no Ko, literal: monster and child, English: The Boy and the Best), second half:

 This is what naturally happens when one communicates through a known human language: ideas are created, represented as words, and when writing about philosophy or design, patterns could be created, patterns to another language: <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Pattern_Language">a pattern language</a>.
 
 Writings on design, such as <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/noisy-transportation-destroys-social-atmosphere">this one</a>, seem to tend to easily generate [design] patterns.
 
 <em>Philosophy patterns</em> appear more often in continental philosophy and critical theory, both of which are more dialectical, perhaps requiring the creation of words to describe social phenomenon. Marx's terms come to mind: <em>accumulation of capital</em>, <em>surplus value</em>, Zizek's <em>surplus enjoyment</em>, and core critical theory terms such as <em>ideology</em> and <em>hagemony</em>.
 
 This was <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/why-did-i-read">one of the reasons I enjoyed reading these kinds of philosophy</a>, and believe it's worth getting a dictionary of critical theory terms. I wanted to describe reality, but didn't have a language to describe it. Then I read some philosophy (substantially from Wikipedia) and found the terms they used useful; They helped me write and more accurately transform my thoughts into a human language.
 
 But, reading is not necessary, as I mentioned before, words can always be created. People know the idea behind ideology and hagemony, but just don't know the word. Connecting ideas to existing words is not necessary. Perhaps even, it results in negative consequences, because <strong>the language's vocabulary (and grammar?) narrows and limits what thoughts can be represented or expressed. It is always better (including efficient) to create words [as opposed to finding and using existing ones]; It is creative and more fun. Perhaps it is even better to not create words, instead prioritizing visual, audio, and reality.</strong> 6680 2016-05-01 15:14:50 2016-05-01 19:14:50 open closed my-blog-contains-a-pattern-language publish 0 0 post 0 Applied Philosophy Communication Critical Theory Design Humanities Linguistics Philosophy Philosophy of Language Social Philosophy medium_post O:11:"Medium_Post":11:{s:16:"author_image_url";s:74:"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/200/200/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png";s:10:"author_url";s:28:"https://medium.com/@rahil627";s:11:"byline_name";N;s:12:"byline_email";N;s:10:"cross_link";s:2:"no";s:2:"id";s:12:"d0f56888a875";s:21:"follower_notification";s:3:"yes";s:7:"license";s:19:"all-rights-reserved";s:14:"publication_id";s:2:"-1";s:6:"status";s:6:"public";s:3:"url";s:77:"https://medium.com/@rahil627/my-blog-contains-a-pattern-language-d0f56888a875";} _edit_last 1 _yoast_wpseo_primary_category 207 On Stoicism http://rahilpatel.com/blog/on-stoicism Fri, 06 May 2016 16:49:59 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=6746 <h2>On Stoicism</h2>
 After what felt like several years of cold, summer finally arrived in Taiwan, with its beautiful shifts of before the storm weather, bursts of typhoons, and sweltering zero entropy humidity. With it, I began to wake up late, lulling to “Summertime” by Girls, and the rest of that half of the album. With the summer laze, I feel I can relax, be apolitical, do some useless professional work for a high rate of capital. So, I thought, it would be an excellent time to read some Stoicism, especially <em>Meditations</em> by Marcus Aurelius.
 
 Here, it seems, I found my childhood’s ethics (<a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/moderate-ethics">Moderate Ethics</a>, <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/early-ethics">Early Ethics</a>, <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/im-fortunate">I’m Fortunate</a>). Be responsible, diligent, do your work, focus on work. But I was a child, Marcus was a Roman Emperor. It seems he never grew up out of these childish ethics. He did his work diligently until death. He lived a rather normal life.
 
 <blockquote>Not to be sidetracked by my interest in rhetoric.
 <cite>Marcus Aurelius, <em>Meditations</em></cite></blockquote>
 
 <strong>Book one’s ethics merely sketches the model of a socially normal, straightforward father: the model of the role he played. To play that role was his goal, the plan, for him, and then by him.</strong>
 
 <blockquote>That I wasn’t more talented in rhetoric or poetry, or other areas. If I’d felt that I was making better progress I might never have given them up.</blockquote>
 
 He avoided the difficulties of academic philosophy, granted he was reared to become an Emperor. He avoided thinking deeply. He didn’t think of the problems of philosophy, mind (psychology), humans (anthropology), society (social philosophy, political philosophy). By avoiding it all, <strong>he lacked critical thinking in these areas.</strong>
 
 He also avoided art, in the education from it, and the process of creating it. <strong>His communication was restricted to human languages: rhetoric.</strong>
 
 <blockquote>That whenever I felt like helping someone who was short of money, or otherwise in need, I never had to be told that I had no resources to do it with. And that I was never put in that position myself—of having to take something from someone else.</blockquote>
 
 He never experienced what it is to be someone else, poor, a slave, in a different place, excluded, etc. He probably didn’t think deeply of these problems either; It’s against his <em>principles</em>. Therefore, <strong>his view of societies and individuals was very limited.</strong>
 
 If my childhood ethics match his, then perhaps he too didn’t experience or concieve what it would be like to be raised and live in other societies and their cultures. He kept the same role, job, class, but physically moved for work purposes. It almost sounds like the ethics of a good suburban child, which makes it seem as if he derived much of his philosophy within the walls of his isolated cozy dwelling, which contradicts the reality of an Emporer’s life.
 
 <strong>His ethics are shallow. His cherished traits avoid the discovery of knowledge (of humans and natural science), art, design, and technology. </strong> Therefore, <strong>he is merely reduced to an interlocutor with good rhetoric and socially normal ethics.</strong> This may have worked for the role of an Emporer, but it doesn’t work for a society (easily apparent for Ancient Greece, with its many philosophers, artists, and formal and natural scientists).
 <h2>Stoicism in Taiwan</h2>
 <strong>It seems the culture of Taiwan have many characteristics of Stoicism embedded [into it].</strong> Perhaps there is some overlap between Confucius ethics and Stoicism. The culture still reads Ancient Greek philosophy as part of their early and late education. The country lacks contemporary forms of art (entirely: in education, museums, and the hippest art districts); their medium is mostly the Chinese language and physical crafts (which is basically the only forms in the history of Chinese art). <strong>The culture restricts people from expressing themselves, prioritizing <em>responsibility</em> (or benevolence?). The culture doesn’t understand the process of creativity, throwing diverse people and ideas together in the same space, thinking, expressing, out of passion, out of intrinsic desire, altering society. There have never been any great artists (three exceptional filmmakers, also art here being a very limited definition), philosophers (according to the West), designers, or inventors from the country.</strong>
 
 The same contradictions of Stoicism exist in Taiwan’s culture: they work diligently without questioning why. There isn’t deep thought into social philosophical problems. This allows capitalism to nearly freely determine the lives of the people. <strong>They work diligently for capital without questioning why. Work is work, and life is so. Perhaps it’s hard, but what can be done? That is the ideology. An ideology which contains stoicism.</strong>
 
 <strong>There are no passions to do more, to create, to consume crazily</strong> for gestalts, to think independently, to go out and dance all night, to make games all day, to analyze deeply of social or cultural problems, to desire social or cultural change, to innovate to solve social or urban or environmental problems, to engage in dialectic with institutions internationally to cooperate academically, to obstruct society or individuals in any way, to engage in any kind of serious conversation with other individuals.
 
 <strong>Thus, all there is to do in the culture is to live a Stoic’s life</strong>: to live “responsibly”, work, consume (increased by capitalism), have shallow experiences (because aesthetics have not developed), shallowly understand others (and make huge generalizations of entire races and countries), yet be kind toward all, <strong>living <em>unexamined lives</em>.</strong>
 
 <strong>It [stoicism] creates a society that is unartful, dispassionate, uncritical, apolitical, uniform.</strong>
 <h2>A Note</h2>
 Though I am critical of Book 1 of <em>Meditations</em> and of Marcus, these are only a few selected highlights which I wanted to focus on and argue against. I actually think there are a ton of good or interesting things said in the book. I just had to get this bit out of my mind before I continued.
 
 It seems, thus far, though Marcus wrote well of Stoic ethics, Epictetus (and probably Seneca too) reaches much deeper in philosophy.

 <a href="http://wiki.zibet.net/wiki.pl/Stoic_Texts">This website</a> provides good info for translations, and a good introduction book.
 <h2>Selected Highlights and Notes on <em>Meditations</em> by Marcus Aurelius</h2>
 Book 1:
 <blockquote>To do my own work, mind my own business, and have no time for slanderers.</blockquote>
 
 <blockquote>To practice philosophy, and to study with Baccheius, and then with Tandasis and Marcianus. To write dialogues as a student. To choose the Greek lifestyle—the camp-bed and the cloak.</blockquote>
 - No sports, focus on philosophy! Also, writing dialogues seems like a good method of learning. And, having a camp bed, to allow the body to live simply, is great. The cloak, I'm guessing refers to war, which in the context of time, is also a great decision, and really must have shaped their body, attunning them to reality. Of this last bit, I feel related to my desire for nomadism, to avoid sedentarism.
 
 <blockquote>Not to be sidetracked by my interest in rhetoric.</blockquote>
 - *** Avoid abstract philosophy, stick to reality, action, practical philosophy. Practice, not academic philosophy
 
 <blockquote>Independence and unvarying reliability</blockquote>
 - ***
 
 <blockquote>pay attention to nothing, no matter how fleetingly, except the logos</blockquote>
 - *****
 
 <blockquote>And for introducing me to Epictetus’s lectures—and loaning me his own copy.</blockquote>
 - Mmm, Epictetus book of lectures, maybe includes the enchiridion!
 
 <blockquote>What it means to live as nature requires</blockquote>
 - and later again, That I was shown clearly and often what it would be like to live as nature requires
 - Second time mentioned this. I guess it's just stoicism from earlier stoics.
 
 <blockquote>...the principles we ought to live by.</blockquote>
 - Should humans have principles?***** It seems to me Marcus took a set of principles, ethics, to live by, but is it possible that such a set could be successful? Doesn't life require different sets for different goals? To experience different states of minds. I don't think any stoic would make a good artist, or many other personalities. They are a narrow set of personalities made for the Senate.
 
 <blockquote>His ability to get along with everyone.</blockquote>
 - *** Reminds me of Ivar. Getting along with everyone is different from being everyone, or another. There is still a class difference. One can get along with a slave, but to do nothing about the fact slavery exists is wrong.
 
 <blockquote>To recognize the malice, cunning, and hypocrisy that power produces...</blockquote>
 - Sneaky power tricks of upper classes
 
 <blockquote>...the peculiar ruthlessness often shown by people from “good families.”</blockquote>
 - Mmm, corrupted upper class
 
 <blockquote>Not to be constantly telling people (or writing them) that I’m too busy, unless I really am.</blockquote>
 - ***** very important. I think Taiwan's culture is good with it. But with such small deeds, could one ever specialize knowledge? And change society through discovery or technology?
 
 <blockquote>Similarly, not to be always ducking my responsibilities to the people around me because of “pressing business.”</blockquote>
 - ***** Responsibilities to the people around. Sounds like a spatial thing there. But yes, perhaps being responsible is another stoic standard. But, did he ever think of why he was responsible for them? Does he not think of what other groups of people or societies are responsible of? Is he simply a completely digiligeny socially normal person?
 
 <blockquote>...conceived of a society of equal laws, governed by equality of status and of speech, and of rulers who respect the liberty of their subjects above all else.</blockquote>
 - ***** this is beautifully simple
 
 <blockquote>Doing your job without whining.</blockquote>
 - Slave-like thought, if the job I'd actually harmful to society, or useless
 
 <blockquote>...his advance planning (well in advance)</blockquote>
 - ***** as opposed to desiring socio-political change now, slow change for the slaves
 
 <blockquote>That I wasn’t more talented in rhetoric or poetry, or other areas. If I’d felt that I was making better progress I might never have given them up.</blockquote>
 - *****Neither a politician or an artist
 
 <blockquote>That whenever I felt like helping someone who was short of money, or otherwise in need, I never had to be told that I had no resources to do it with. And that I was never put in that position myself—of having to take something from someone else.</blockquote>
 - Fortunate in capital too, no experience of being excluded or poor
 
 <blockquote>That when I became interested in philosophy I didn’t fall into the hands of charlatans, and didn’t get bogged down in writing treatises, or become absorbed by logic-chopping, or preoccupied with physics.</blockquote>
 - Not science, not philosophy treatise, not minute logic. Just the practical bits that can be applied to life: notably, ethics.

 <blockquote>The Stoics taught that destructive emotions resulted from errors in judgment, and the active relationship between cosmic determinism and human freedom, and the belief that it is virtuous to maintain a will (called prohairesis) that is in accord with nature.
 - Wikipedia, Stoicism</blockquote>
 
 <blockquote>According to Stoic ethical theory, the stage in which a human being merely keeps himself alive leads to the stage in which he chooses the good and rejects the bad; this leads to the exercise of choice out of a sense of duty of which he is not fully conscious. The fourth stage is the state of continuously making the correct choice. The final stage of ethical development sees the individual abstracting from experience and forming general ideas about good and evil. This results in an understanding of the natural order of the cosmos to which choices are to be made to conform. In other words, he sees the harmony of the Whole, which is the good, because the harmony is nature. He then chooses to conform to the harmonious Whole, being fully conscious of its nature through abstraction.</blockquote>

 But before I could read, I had to get through translation decision hell for Laozi's (老子) Dao De Jing (道德經) and Zhuangzi (莊子). For now, here are my notes:
 
 <h2>Laozi</h2>
 Modern Chinese:
 ?. There are <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/author/2427">two versions on Project Gutenberg</a>. One seems to be similar to the one on <a href="http://ctext.org/dao-de-jing">ctext</a>; The other has more punctuation.
 x. 陳鼓應，《老子今註今譯》
 - The format makes this unreadable (digitally and physically!): original text in Classical Chinese -> massive amount of notes (500 pages) -> translation in Modern Chinese; No parallel text.
 
 English:
 Literal:
 0. Yutang Lin
 - best first verse, poetic yet literal, entirely comprehendable, no random words left as other translators do with Chinese, better choice of words: "absolute" over "eternal", "from mystery to deep mystery" over merely "deep and profound" or "deep and deep" or "deep again"
 - I initially got only the main text from terebess, which is what I based my decision on, but it seems his book, <em>Wisdom of Laotse</em> (maybe included in his <em>Wisdom of China</em> and <em>Wisdom of China and India</em>), is 300 pages with notes, probably having the best introduction, an imaginary discussion with Zhuangzi, then fits bits of Zhuangzi where it makes sense. He <em>gets</em> it. It must be a gem, a jade perhaps.
 0. Tim Chilcott
 - this fantastic find is a parallel text which includes simplified Chinese, hanyu pinyin, and his own translation, which itself seems quite good, probably borrowing a lot from past translations. It's fantastic because the pdf file is modern, with links to notes on words and phrases. I'm starting to think this text is best translated by non-academics. Also, he created <a href="http://www.tclt.org.uk/10th_aniversary/Thoughts_across_Two_Thousand_Years.pdf">a cool text which compiles quotes from people about translating spanning two thousand years </a>.
 1. Wing-Tsit Chan
 1. John Wu (Shambhala)
 - Chan and Wu seem quite similar, both supposedly highly reputed translations. I started with Chan then changed to Yutang Lin.
 1.2?. Waley
 - also highly reputed
 ?. Ling-Feng Yen (both versions: Mawangdui Boshu Laozi)
 ?. Ivanhoe
 ?. Henricks (combines both versions [Wangbi and Mawangdui], also has other slip translations)
 x. D.C. Lau (two versions)
 - converts text to fit English grammar; Terrible.
 
 Poetic:
 1. Jane English (Vintage)
 2. Ursula Guin (Shambhala)
 - both look great, maybe English more attentive, with better intuition. Guin's has nice informal contemporary dialog after every few verses.
 
 <h2>Zhuangzi</h2>
 Modern Chinese:
 *. see Modern Chinese translation of Laozi, as the same applies here.
 
 English:
 Post-scholarly:
 1. Hamill and Seaton (Shambhala)
 - seems to combine the best traits of all translations, includes book names, certain Chinese words in brackets, and feels most logically flowing making it the most comparehendable, but less poetic and more wordy because it uses more accurate English words
 - use this if one doesn't understand something.
 1. Brook Ziporyn (Hackett)
 - flows almost as well as Yutang Lin, but more complete like Hamill and Seaton, without being as wordy
 
 Scholarly:
 0. Yutang Lin
 - little older, but my favorite translation [of all] (again!), poetic, detailed yet simple like Jane English's Laozi, seems to have the best grasp of Chinese
 - only translated the selected Inner (excludes one) and Outer chapters, eleven out of thirty-three, with reason in the intro
 1. Victor A. Mair (normally Columbia, but Watson beat him)
 - perhaps more accurate and still flows well, more wordy than Yutang, but on par with Watson, and even interprets into things less than Watson, original scholarly translation
 - probably has a great intro, includes great concise history of China
 - one of two complete translations
 1. Burton Watson (Columbia)
 - interprets a bit more than Mair and perhaps loses some of the Chinese poetics, but flows better than Mair with plain English, original scholarly translation
 - probably has the a great intro
 - one of two complete translations
 ?. Martin Palmer and Elizabeth Breuilly (Penguin), A. C. Graham, Jane English (Vintage, bilingual, inner chapters only), Feng Youlan (bilingual, parallel?), others
 - I think Jane English's version is probably the most valuable, and worth finding, it being poetic and bilingual [todo: find it!]. And of course anything Penguin is worth trying to get too.

 urban planning problem -> [Chris Marker-like] video -> use Facebook comments to talk about it (Facebook comments as forums) -> leads to something?
 
 problems in reality [can be social?] -> media -> create and publish project on a crowdsourcing platform (i.e. Kickstarter) -> implement
 
 examples：
 people don't have or wear motorcycle helmets -> Humans of Taiwan photo -> crowdsource petition (to influence companies, law organisations, etc.) -> keep updated
 broken traffic light -> photo -> find correct organization to inform -> create application to automate process (i.e. FixMyStreet) 6825 2016-05-14 05:16:04 2016-05-14 09:16:04 open closed notes-on-crowdsourcing-civil-action publish 0 0 post 0 Art Civics Design Humanities New Media Personal Philosophy Political Philosophy Thoughts medium_post O:11:"Medium_Post":11:{s:16:"author_image_url";s:74:"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/200/200/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png";s:10:"author_url";s:28:"https://medium.com/@rahil627";s:11:"byline_name";N;s:12:"byline_email";N;s:10:"cross_link";s:2:"no";s:2:"id";s:12:"e15bcb7d6b21";s:21:"follower_notification";s:3:"yes";s:7:"license";s:19:"all-rights-reserved";s:14:"publication_id";s:2:"-1";s:6:"status";s:6:"public";s:3:"url";s:77:"https://medium.com/@rahil627/notes-on-crowdsourcing-civil-action-e15bcb7d6b21";} _edit_last 1 _yoast_wpseo_primary_category 149 Translations of Lives of the Noble Greeks and Romans [Parallel Lives] http://rahilpatel.com/blog/translations-of-parallel-lives Mon, 16 May 2016 12:38:16 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=6850 <h2>notes on the translations of Plutarch's Lives</h2>
 1. Penguin [Classics]
 - mostly translated by Ian Scott-Kilvert
 - 6 books (about 8 lives each), <strong>complete</strong>
 - book format: ?
 - not available on Library Genesis, but it seems there are <a href="http://smart-torrents.com/plutarch-greek-roman-lives-essays-tf4037020.html">torrents</a>, too bad I don't have my laptop with me at the moment!
 - <strong>I'm guessing this is the best edition.</strong>
 
 2. Modern Library [Classics]
 - translated by John Dryden (<strong>1683</strong>!), edited by Arthur Hugh Clough (<strong>1872</strong>!). Though dated, from the little bit I read, it read just fine, on par with Perrin's translation -- an accurate translation. I would have to read more. Scholars advise to avoid Dryden, but I might actually prefer this over the scholarly ones.
 - just 2 volumes! <strong>complete</strong>!
 - <strong>until I get the Penguin series, <a href="https://archive.org/details/livesofnoblegrec00plutiala">this epic one volume eBook</a> is the best choice</strong>, they took the time to digitize it perfectly.
 - <strong>the introduction, a biography of Plutarch, is a feat in scholarship</strong>, whereas Bernadotte is merely a one page intro
 
 3. Oxford [World Classics]
 - translated by Robin Waterfield, and it's amazing, super readable, little punctuation
 - 3 books: Greek Lives (9), Roman Lives (8-9, contains Gracchuses), Hellenisitic Lives (?, published this year, 2016), <strong>incomplete as of now</strong>
 - book format: for each life: introduction (by Philip A. Stadter), introduction sources cited (why!?), then Plutarch's content. <strong>It is missing Plutarch's comparison essays!</strong> At the end of the book there are notes, proper names, textual notes, etc.
 - available via <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/themetalibrary/library-genesis">Library Genesis</a>
 
 3. Harvard [Loeb Classical Library]
 - translated by Bernadotte Perrin, and it's a little less readable than Waterfield, with far more punctuation marks, but perfectly fine and modern
 - 11 volumes: two to three pairs each, <strong>complete</strong>
 - for $3, Delphi Classics seems specialize in eBook, and in this case, has <a href="https://www.delphiclassics.com/shop/plutarch/">one for Plutarch</a>, which contains the entire Parallel Lives and Moralia, both using Perrin's translations, but I believe it keeps the Greek-English parallel format
 - book format is rough for eBook readers as it is parallel text Greek and English. The eBook reader must have a landscape double page function, or else reading is impossible.
 - <a href="https://archive.org/search.php?query=creator%3A%22Perrin%2C%20Bernadotte%22%20lives">available entirely on the Internet Archive</a>
 - <a href="http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/home.html">LacusCurtius</a> (Penelope.uChicago.edu), "<em>A site for teaching yourself to read Latin inscriptions.</em>", contains most texts from Loeb, in English, single page HTML, all content maintained neatly, with links to Perrin's notes and the author of the site, Thayer's notes
 - this would make it a better option than Oxford's eBook for reading via eBook reader, but one would have to save them all as html (DownThemAll! Firefox plugin equivalent for Chrome?) then combine them in the correct order. I'll wait until I get my laptop and get the Penguin edition.
 - <a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/collection">The Perseus Project</a> (www.Perseus.Tufts.edu) seems to separate html pages by each live and each section making it entirely unreadable (what is the point of doing this?). I'm not sure if there's a way to view or download things in their entirety.
 
 <h2>a lesson</h2>
 <strong>The Oxford and Harvard editions are <em>"scholarly"</em>, which for us mortals translates to <em>less accessible</em>, which opposes one of the tenets of art, making them detrimental to life. Leave those insular schools and their [publishing] presses to their insular selves. For the future: simply get the Penguin edition, if not, jump into a crusty old translation, more convenient if it's within a <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/the-kinds-of-literature-and-the-extraction-of-ideas">reader or sourcebook</a>, if not, <em>do something else</em>.</strong>
 
 <h2>other Ancient Greek or Roman biographers</h2>
 <strong>Suetonius - Twelve Caesars
 - published by Penguin</strong> and Oxford
 - <strong>seems like the perfect Roman primary source companion to Parallel Lives</strong>
 Diogenes Laertius - Lives of Eminent Philosophers
 - published by Cambridge, perhaps it's not plagued by <em>"scholarship"</em>
 Philostratus - Lives of the Sophists
 - solely published by Harvard [Loeb Classical Library]?
 - digressing: <a href="http://www.cambridge.org/do/academic/subjects/classical-studies/ancient-history/social-world-intellectuals-roman-empire-sophists-philosophers-and-christians"><strong>The Social World of Intellectuals in the Roman Empire</strong></a>. *drool*. Need this for Ancient Greece.
 Eunapius - Lives of Philosophers and Sophists
 - contained in the second half of that Harvard publication of Philostratus
 - All of the modern translations of these biographers are unfortunately available from Harvard [Loeb Classical Library]. There are older translations available on the Internet Archive, and some newer translations as mentioned, but I'd rather <em>do something else</em>. Perhaps in the future Penguin may deem them worthy enough for the common people.

It provides the only safe, romantic release from the severe Confucian classic restraint, and humanizes the very humanists themselves; therefore when a Chinese succeeds, he is always a Confucianist, and when he fails, he is always a Taoist. <cite>Yutang Lin (林語堂), <em>Zhuangzi (莊子)</em>, Introduction</cite></p> </blockquote> <p>I recently felt that in Taiwan, and this may apply to any single-cultured country, that the choice of cultures is ultimately limited to two: with the society or without.</p> <p>Taiwan lacks communities with diversity and ideal values. Of my time here, I have only found two places with ideal values but without diversity (of mind), and several with a little more diversity but without ideal values. Furthermore, I felt unable to find or even create a place-based community within Taiwan's society.</p> <p>That feeling contrasts with the feeling in multiple-cultured societies, where I felt I'm able to manipulate a space to create a place-based community within the existing dense settlement, or simply join one of the existing diverse, ideal-valued communities.</p> <p>Taiwan has one culture [not including aboriginal cultures], therefore there is only one choice within it. America has several cultures, therefore several choices exist through its cultures: other countries' cultures, capitalism, art life, consumerism, religions, non-culture, media-oriented culture (suburbanism), technological optimism, hippies, small towns, The South, etc.</p> <p>In Taiwan, the only partially-inclusive spaces I have found with such diverse cultures are places where international people meet: hostels, Chinese class, post-graduate school. I have not found other spaces [within the society] that escape the cultural values of Taiwanese society.</p> <p>Hostels are where I lived and what I mostly called a home, so the experience was phenomenal: I had a well-valued home, surrounded by a ethically-good culture and infinite nature. Without such places, one finds one's self in a scary singular society, and without willingness to participate in that scary society, one is left with only one choice: to leave it.</p> <p>It is by far the society I've spent the longest time in, excluding the suburbs where I grew up. But, I can't say I lived <em>in</em> it the entire time. I was in my own world [todo: link a post which exemplifies this], while my body was in Taiwan's world. Perhaps the public spaces were the only Taiwanese places I've spent a lot of time in: the streets, day markets, neighborhoods, parks, nature: you know, the spaces where passion is satisfied capital-free. I'm unsure if that counts as living in it.</p> <p>Alas, it is time to find that little place next to the mountain, not far from a city, with the best climate (and microclimate!) of the country. Somewhere east of Tainan I believe. And so, like the Trascendentalists who probably had to escape Puritanism, and the Taoists who probably had to escape Confucianism, I must escape Taiwanese culture, or whatever words one uses to describe the values of contemporary Taiwan.</p> <p>At least, for the moment; Before I re-attempt to create an ideal community within the city[?] again; Or before I re-attempt to cooperate with Taiwanese society again [No! Create your own. Do not join others. Let them join you!].</p> <h2>progeniting an ideal cooperative from nothing, with special guest: Aristotle</h2> <p>[I] Also might need a place in the city too, but hopefully with good weather and easy access to nature to keep me sane [Noooo].</p> <blockquote> <p>The next twelve years Aristotle devoted with extraordinary industry to the establishment of a school, the Lyceum, to the institution and pursuit of a program of investigation, speculation, and teaching in almost every branch of knowledge, and to the composition of all, or most, or at least the more scientific portions, of those of his writings which are now extant. <cite>Richard McKeon, <em>The Basic Works of Aristotle</em>, Biographical Note</cite></p> </blockquote> <p><em>This</em>, except for my directions: critical theory, social and urban interventions, civic technology, games, etc.</p> <blockquote> <p>Aristotle began teaching regularly in the morning in the Lyceum and founded an official school called "The Lyceum". After morning lessons, Aristotle would frequently lecture on the grounds for the public and manuscripts of his compiled lectures were eventually circulated. The group of scholars who followed the Aristotelian doctrine came to be known as the Peripatetics due to Aristotle’s tendency to walk as he taught.</p> </blockquote> <p>So, I should begin by creating meet-ups in public places: ask a well-located temple; or can alternate places based on weather: hot springs, cold springs, day markets. Whoever comes frequently, may become a friend or associate, but the goal is not to create an organization:</p> <blockquote> <p>Unlike Plato, <em>Aristotle was not a citizen of Athens and so could not own property; he and his colleagues therefore used the grounds of the Lyceum as a gathering place, just as it had been used by earlier philosophers such as Socrates.</em> Aristotle and his colleagues first began to use the Lyceum in this way in about 335 BCE., after which <strong>Aristotle left Plato's Academy and Athens, and then returned to Athens from his travels about a dozen years later.</strong> Because of the school's association with the gymnasium, the school also came to be referred to simply as the Lyceum. Some modern scholars argue that <strong>the school did not become formally institutionalized until Theophrastus took it over, at which time there was private property associated with the school.</strong> <cite>Wikipedia, Peripatetic school</cite></p> </blockquote> <p>If Aristotle was a citizen and was able to own property, would he have tried to get space? Did he have the money (surely Alexander paid him well. Maybe I'm reading this wrong?)? When such a good space exists, why spend money on another space? Use the public space!</p> <blockquote> <p><em>Aristotle’s main focus as a teacher was cooperative research</em>, an idea which he founded through his natural history work and systematic collection of philosophical works to contribute to his <em>library</em>. His students were assigned historical or scientific research <em>projects</em> as part of their studies. <em>The school was also student run.</em> The students elected a new student administrator to work with the school leadership every ten days, allowing all the students to become involved in turn. <cite>Richard McKoen</cite></p> </blockquote> <p>Yes, the program is entirely cooperative, and molded by the people within it. Though, projects shouldn't be assigned by one person, rather, people should assign it to themselves, and be responsible for it, out of intrinsic desire, which is precisely what a good social meet-up conceives in the minds of its participants.</p> <p>Administration is a pain: setting up meetings, inventory management, etc. The dirty work must be shared, just as cleaning a bathroom in a shared apartment is.</p> <p>Media can be shared within a physical space. It must be convenient to access to by participants that use it the most. Because one doesn't have a space, one will have to negotiate, in the case of a temple, with the temple's staff. [problem: access limited by time; not 24 hours]</p> <blockquote> <p>The aim of the school, at least in Aristotle's time, was not to further a specific doctrine, but rather <em>to explore</em> philosophical and scientific theories; <em>those who ran the school worked rather as equal partners.</em> <cite>Wikipedia</cite></p> </blockquote> <p>Everyone has an equal say in the whole of the organization.</p> <p>The meet-ups ("school") do not have <em>a</em> direction. The direction depends on its constituents, on what's in the mind of the participants <em>at that time</em>. The participants and the directions may change frequently: Directions are temporal as the wandering mind's thoughts. Participants are temporal too, as long as they are wandering too.</p> <h2>re-joining society</h2> <p>[todo: ??? I just had a daydream about restarting Humans of Taiwan, in Tainan, but with a critical theory emphasis. It's still a similar format, but I select topics, questions, to be more critical. Pictures too can be critical, of urban and social problems. With it, people commented, and sometimes it would be civically helpful, and I would be able to solve small problems with the help of commenters. Doing this everyday would provide me organizing experience, networking with organizations, civic discussion through Facebook, and I would provide a model to solve civic problems. It is entirely bottom-up, because I begin with the individual's problem; that is, what the individual thinks is a problem in their mind. By limiting subjects to I individuals' problems, larger solutions, projects, implementations, may develop. ]</p> 7222 2016-05-14 14:56:54 2016-05-14 18:56:54 open closed the-choices-in-taiwan-and-initiating-a-cooperative-from-nothing publish 0 0 post 0 Applied Philosophy Autonomy Community Humanities Life Personal Philosophy Philosophy of Education Political Philosophy Public Sphere Social Philosophy Thoughts medium_post O:11:"Medium_Post":11:{s:16:"author_image_url";s:74:"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/200/200/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png";s:10:"author_url";s:28:"https://medium.com/@rahil627";s:11:"byline_name";N;s:12:"byline_email";N;s:10:"cross_link";s:2:"no";s:2:"id";s:12:"4d76045c2d33";s:21:"follower_notification";s:3:"yes";s:7:"license";s:19:"all-rights-reserved";s:14:"publication_id";s:2:"-1";s:6:"status";s:6:"public";s:3:"url";s:102:"https://medium.com/@rahil627/choices-in-taiwan-and-progeniting-a-cooperative-from-nothing-4d76045c2d33";} _edit_last 1 _yoast_wpseo_primary_category 207 _wp_old_slug choices-in-taiwan-and-progeniting-a-cooperative-from-nothing _wp_old_slug choices-in-taiwan-and-initiating-a-cooperative-from-nothing Notes on Translations of Ancient Literature http://rahilpatel.com/blog/notes-on-translations-of-ancient-literature Thu, 19 May 2016 14:26:44 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=6900 [related writings: <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/what-is-worth-reading">What is Worth Reading?</a>, <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/notes-on-translations-of-ancient-literature">Notes on Translations of Ancient Literature</a>, <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/lessons-in-research-of-a-past-time">Lessons in Research of a Past Time</a>, <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/the-kinds-of-literature-and-the-extraction-of-ideas">The Kinds of Literature and the Extraction of Ideas</a>]
 
 Two recent posts have been about finding a <em>good</em>, if not the <em>best</em> translation and/or publication of ancient literature: <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/laozi-and-zhuangzi-translation-hell">Dao De Jing (道德經) and Zhuangzi (莊子) </a>and <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/parallel-lives-translations">Plutarch's Lives</a>. I took the notes and the lesson from those posts and placed them here.
 
 <h2>notes on publishers</h2>
 1. <strong>Penguin [Classics]</strong>
 - good, simple book format (which is becomes more important when reading digitally): intro, then straight to content
 - most often has (/ probably can afford and copyright) the best translation
 - for prolific authors they to divide works by several books often with different translators, which would make word choices inconsistent, and reading a bit more cumbersome (again, doubly important for digital reading)
 2. Oxford [World's Classics]
 - similar [to Penguin], but in the case of Plutarch's Lives, failed by excluding content
 <h3>Western</h3>
 1. <strong>none</strong>
 - if one doesn't like the Penguin edition, then some other random publisher may have a better publication (physical format, digital format, extra content) or translation (Hackett, Basic Books, Yale, Cambridge, etc.)
 - if one wants complete works, again, some other random publisher may have it (ex. Modern Library for Aristotle and Plutarch's Lives, Hackett for Plato, Landmark for Ancient Greece historians, etc.)
 *. Delphi Classics eBook
 – made for digital! Translator is probably limited to those that are available for free, which could be crusty.
 x. Harvard [Loeb Classical Library]
 - avoid, billingual Greek and very literally translated English, made for anal academicians. Perhaps for ease of secondary translators?
 <h3>Eastern</h3>
 1. <strong>none</strong> – probably some random native translator who is capable of thinking like an ancient native person, such as Yutang Lin and Wing-tsit Chan for ancient Chinese philosophy
 - <strong><em>A Source Book in Indian Philosophy</em> by Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, Charles A. Moore</strong> (Princeton)
 - <strong><em>A Source Book in Chinese Philosophy</em> by Wing-tsit Chan (Rongjie Chen)</strong> (Princeton)
 -- published after helping Watson with <em>Sources of Chinese Tradition</em> (Columbia)
 - <strong><em>The Wisdom of China [and India]</em> by Yutang Lin</strong> (Random House, Modern Libary, picked it up)
 -- he wrote a history of Chinese philosophy and even translates the Chinese sources, <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/translations-of-laozi-and-zhuangzi-a-translation-hell">which I thought were the best translations of Laozi <em>and</em> Zhuangzi</a>. For the India portion, I believe he writes the history, but selects translations of sources.
 - <em>Readings in Classical Chinese Philosophy</em> by Ivanhoe and Norden (Hackett)
 0.5 Columbia (Watson, Mair)
 - seems like a niche monopoly here. Better than Penguin and Oxford for Laozi, and maybe Zhuangzi too (<strong>doesn't this show how insular and analytic (read: anal) Harvard and Oxford are?

So, <strong>it seems that they are composed of <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/lessons-in-research-of-a-past-time">social, intellectual, and religious histories</a>. That's a huge feat.

 <h2>a recent lesson</h2>
 <blockquote><strong>The Oxford and Harvard editions are <em>"scholarly"</em>, which for us mortals translates to <em>less accessible</em>, which opposes one of the tenets of art, making them detrimental to life. Leave those insular schools and their [publishing] presses to their insular selves. For the future: simply get the Penguin edition, if not, jump into a crusty old translation, more convenient if it's within a <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/the-kinds-of-literature-and-the-extraction-of-ideas">reader or sourcebook</a>, if not, <em>do something else</em>.</strong>

Complete todos / reorganize.]
 
 Note: This post currently has a lot of thoughts digressing in many directions. My bad.
 
 <h2>writing transcribed from a paper, then continued writing here:</h2>
 Sophism, during/under Emperial [Imperial] Rome, does not seem bad. It focused on human affairs: everyday life, the management of it, during the largest expansion of the empire.
 
 There was less theory, natural science. Sophists may have prioritized superficial rhetoric [style over content], but it also prioritized politics, economics, and social life -- isn't that what matters most?
 
 <h3>sophist competition</h3>
 What's interesting [to me] is how sophists competed, individually. The educational institutions of Ancient Greece had already declined to their demise. Without institutions, sophists taught privately (in their own home, in their student's home, or in another private place perhaps [reminds me of Taiwan]) and publicly (via lectures in public venues -- bookshops, outside, temples, larger public venues [reminds me of New York]). <strong>It seems that sophists were basically artist-teachers, public-philosophers.</strong>
 
 Unbound by institutions, they had to compete in the public of competitive cities, and to do so rhetoric (especially oration) skills were crucial. <strong>Spoken language was <em>the</em> medium of politics.</strong> Written, perhaps less so, except in the form of conversational letters or short treatises. It was a time of actuality, action; It opposed the sedentary writing of knowledge of the recent past (Classical Greek philosophy). What mattered most were contemporary events, not science, -- How to maintain the empire.
 
 <h3>real philosophy</h3>
 It seems not much of the Second Sophists' works have been read (not sure if lost or deemed unimportant; only one modern English translation of the primary source exists), but <strong>I imagine their writings are about action, process philosophy, being, Stoic ethics, whatever needed to get shit done. And because of this, I think this period of time is worth idealizing, looking into, of the intellectual life, everyday life, the mass and the mess of decisions and actions taken to handle the doubling of territory size, tripling the population, and all the cultural conflicts within.</strong>
 
 <strong>This is real philosophy: The recording of communicative action.</strong> It opposes the categorizing, analytic kind synonymous to the Western canon, likely created by people under ideal societal conditions and/or in isolation, which in turn, was likely extended by engaging in dialectic with people in the past who wrote under similar conditions. <strong>The communicative actions, decided by the discourse between Emperors, orators (including sophists), and senators, decided the course, the political course, of the empire. "The philosophers have only interpreted the world, in various ways. <em>Sophers</em>, however, changed it."</strong>
 
 [todo: compare this kind of narrow political communicative action philosophy to modern cumulative social philosophy which takes into consideration the cultural, economic, environmental spheres, in addition to the political.
 
 Well, surely the Roman intellectuals tried to take as much into consideration, as much as they were aware of at the time, within the time constraint. Because they weren't aware of too much socio-cultural problems, I mean they were killing <em>"barbarians"</em>, they simply continued taking action determined by political communication, which seemed to be to continue expanding the empire. That's not good.
 
 Anyway, <strong>I'm more interested in how the individual intellectuals near-directly influenced the politics of the empire, internationally and locally.</strong>, not so much of the specific decisions they made; they were terrible.]
 --
 
 <h3>sophize, now!</h3>
 So. <strong>How does one begin, uh, sophizing? Hold discussions in public venues for free. Topics can be chose by me, then later decided with whoever participates. The topics should be socio-political, and they should be related to the area the discussion takes place in. Duh.</strong> The dialectics should lead to action. If they do not, then I have failed sophizing.
 
 [todo: how does this differ from normal community consensus decision-making?]
 --
 
 <h3>media vs oration, and toward the ideal stage in the normative development of societies</h3>
 <strong>Forget artistic mediums of communication. Communicate [directly] to the public.</strong> This is a better method of beginning socio-political change. No institution is required. Neither is technology. Just simple language. The complexities of experience, epistemology, social philosophy (critical theory, cultural geography, environmental psychology, etc.), must be reduced to a simple communicable language.
 
 [todo: But, the institutions are in power, nearly everywhere, in all forms: educational, research (science, technology), governmental, medical, urban, enforcement (police), punishment, etc. Can one simply ignore them? 
 
 Yeah, and <strong>that's what's appealing about the [period of] time: it's simple, straightforward, non-beauratic. "Atticus, at one point in time, received up to three letters a day from Emperor Marcus Aurelius. (Wikipedia)." That's an ideal to strive for: the frankness and transparency of the Romans.</strong> And <strong>that can only happen in a society with Stoic-like ethics (todo: link to Stoicism in Taiwan).</strong>
 
 In the social structure contemporary society, to change any institution, either the institution internally decides to change, or the public sphere pressures it to change (assuming the public sphere has a voice and power). That change is far too slow, even if seemingly progressive. All contemporary institutions would collapse if it experienced a single year that Emperial Rome did.
 
 In contrast, the minimal social structure of Emperial Rome was dynamic, flexible; its intitutions could handle huge changes. There were no educational institutions to collapse, just a bunch sophists (individuals and groups); and the political institution, probably just a bunch of sophists posing as senators, whom also dealt with outsider sophists. Because there weren't many institutions, people had to make decisions for themselves, take their own directions. 
 
 <strong>This seems like an ideal point in the normative development of societies.</strong> Any more order, and the institutions will become too fragile. Any less order, and ? [todo; not sure: the society collapses?].

 <h3>side notes</h3>
 In contrast, Plutarch was more of a hermit, not competitive, at least not by the end of his life, where he only orated to close friends and family in his small hometown, and spent most time writing.

 <h3>thoughts on the introduction chapter of Eshleman's book:</h3>
 There's so much appeal in the Second Sophistic to me: it reminds me of my experience in New York; Most intellectuals were not part of an institution, because there there weren't many; Therefore, there were no professional qualifications to control expertise (qualifications didn't matter much). The intellectuals had to maintain their rhetoric abilities in order to prove they were currently legit (no guaranteed professor or government positions). To be recognized as legit, skilled peers must judge their skills positively: "game recognize game". Likewise, ability to judge was a required skill, as it determined recognized skill levels. (Eshleman, introduction)
 
 Eshleman tells of how reputation depends on [1] skill, [2] reputation of peers, [3] academic record, [todo: finish thought]
 
 They simply gathered in public places to discuss. [todo: finish thought]
 
 Does this not sound like any other competitive structure? Freestyle (rapping), fighting video games, breakdancing: a healthy competition amongst artists in the city.
 
 <h4>Romantic Periods</h4>
 Hmmm, you know, I think I have a kind of romantic view of these kinds of periods elsewhere: the Warring States period of China, the Edo period of Japan (maybe? It seems factions warred until they united somehow), Archaic Ancient Greece [todo: find modern social history books focused on these time periods]. These are periods where there were no institutions, no [social] structure, and people panicked and scrambled around a huge amount of territory, eventually thinking of the most original ways society could live: they created philosophical treatises -- ethical treatises: writings to calm the mind during the wars (Zen Buddhism, Spartan ethics (?), Stoic philosophy), writings to allow society to try to live a good life (Confucianism, Virtue ethics [too early?]), the most original epistomology (Pre-Socratic Philosophy, Daoism). <strong>There was a ton of energy during these times, and it was the wise individuals' (philosopher, [Japanese] monk (?), [second] sophist) views that was of importance; and the rulers needed and turned to those individuals for answers.</strong> [It was] Only after they created more structural things to control society, like legal doctrines (Chinese Legalists, Athenien Democracy) or social structures (Spartan Constitution), and then institutionalizing them, did people stop thinking so deeply. The [political and later, educational] institutions lulled the minds to a peaceful rest, narrowing all future thought (ideologies of institutions), of politics and of ethics.
 
 In short, <strong>when societies develop a social structure and institutionalize them, thought is narrowed by the structure, including thoughts about how one lives.</strong>
 
 [todo: possible quote: "Like a good many other Greek philosophers he took a prominent part in the affairs of his native state, and was appointed to draw up a code of laws for it. It is perhaps worth remarking that the professional and professorial philosopher, detached from the normal life of the state and society and entirely absorbed in the work of teaching or research within his philosophical college or community, does not appear in Greece before Alexander the Great..." -- A. H. Armstrong, An Introduction To Ancient Philosophy, Pre-Socratics chapter (I think)
 
 another possible quote: "The sedentary life--as I have said once before--is the real sin against the holy spirit" - Nietzsche, Ecce Homo]
 
 <h3>Inclusion/Exclusion and the Transition from Oral to Written</h3>
 "...the need to demarcate the boundaries of a group in which membership was highly desirable (at least in some quarters), but poorly defined and institutionally fluid. (Eshleman, introduction)" <strong>The need to demarcate [group boundaries] is a problem of the human need to organize, in this case, socially organize. Having no boundary is an ideal of social organization: all participation should be open to the public and voluntary.</strong>
 
 "...the other end, Christopher Jones has shown that a decisive shift in taste was underway already when Philostratus wrote, away from the improvised declamations that he cherished as the hallmark of the Second Sophistic, and toward the more literary style exemplified by Aelius Aristides (Eshleman, introduction)." Perhaps that shift is most apparent between Cicero and Seneca. Cicero were very oral, known for his speeches, letters, dialogues, and short treatises, written by his shorthand-innovating stenographer Tiro. Seneca more literary, with long letters, essays, and dialogues. <strong>After societies develop their primary institutions, perhaps the primary medium [of communication] shifts from oral to written, from an active, often nomadic, way of communicating to a sedentary one. With less action (war) or more sedentarism, time becomes of less importance, and so communicative action in the form of oration decreases, as does the amount of decisions and actions taken, perhaps because the medium of writing is less persuasive than oration (todo: link to media and action).</strong>
 
 <h4>Eshleman's Thesis and My Conclusion</h4>
 "For Christianity, meanwhile, this period was an age of ferment and experiment, in which the core institutions of later Christianity took shape, at least in rough outline. By the middle of the third century an extensive machinery of “orthodoxy” was being forged: a powerful clerical hierarchy, largely fixed scriptural canon, credal norms of interpretation, and increasingly well-theorized mechanisms of certification, for both lay believers and clergy (Eshleman, introduction)." In parallel, the thesis of Eshleman's book now, the formation of the Christian identity and institutions went through <strong>a process strikingly comparable to the formation of the sophist identity and institutions: experiment, compete, define, structure, authorize, institutionalize. Social organization, whether philosopher, sophist, or Christian, all go through the same social processes.</strong>
 
 [todo: But, must it? Must societies organize into a single culture and then institutionalize it? Economically, perhaps, to survive together. But culturally, no: culture is a separate sphere. And <strong>that's the point: having multiple cultures, diversity in cultures, diverse individuals, and nurturing them results in more explorative energy.</strong> This is common sense in a small scale, like a progressive school, an art organization, but not-so-common sense on a large scale. That is, <strong>how does one stop the social process or societal development before self-definition; or, how does one reform to go back to that thriving experimental, competing stage of society?</strong> 
 
 <strong>This experimental stage [of society] seems to usually occur in the history of civilizations during much civil dispute (competition, which in ancient times often meant war) until one culture (including philosophy) wins and unifies the societies.</strong> [todo: incomplete thought]
 
 Does society even want that? Harking Kahneman's answer of robust vs anti-fragile: no. Society wants to be secure.
 
 Then, within a culture, or better, a multi-cultural place, there is only one choice: to individually, or with group of people, compete, experiment, define, structure, live life, but never authorize or institutionalize it upon others. [todo: kind of repeated, what's different? First is general, next is contemporary?]
 
 Thus, <strong>for those of us that do live in an institutionalized culture (everyone), all we can do is create our own little spaces of our own cultures, then experiment, compete (not war), define, structure, and rinse and repeat. Live a different way. You have the will. Try a different set of ethics. Try it even for just an hour, or a day. Try to live like an ancient Roman "with a tent and sword." Create a new sets of ethics, and <em>live</em> by them. <em>Be</em> a saint. <em>Be</em> an asshole. Ignore the environment. Will your life.</strong>

 - including Wikipedia!
 
 dictionary/encyclopedia of selected words/concepts/ideas
 - ex. Dino, Franco Felluga - Critical Theory_ The Key Concepts (Routledge, Key Guides, 2015)
 
 <strong>a dictionary/encyclopedia of a history of selected words/concepts/ideas</strong>
 - <strong><a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/why-did-i-read">to communicate in a human language, it sometimes helps to use the terms other people created, for mutual understanding. Though, of course, one can just make up words for ideas one desires to express. That's way more creative.</a></strong>
 - also quite cool to see how words have changed meaning over time
 - ex. <strong>Williams, Raymond - Keywords_ A Vocabulary of Culture and Society (1985)</strong>
 - ex. Nealon, Jeffrey T._ Giroux, Susan Searlsb - The theory toolbox _ critical concepts for the humanities, arts, and social sciences (Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2012)
 
 <strong>selected text/reading</strong>
 - a piece of writing/work
 - <strong><em>Penguin Great Ideas</em> series</strong>
 
 writing/work/"book"
 - usually has an annoying intro and preface and quote and thanks, can almost always skip them
 
 selected works
 - selected (multiple pieces of complete) writings of a single category, usually a single author
 - ex. Benjamin, Walter, Peter Demetz - Reflections_ Essays, Aphorisms, Autobiographical Writings (Schocken, 1986)
 
 <strong>reader</strong>
 - selected writings of a single category, the category could be a single author, literature from a period of time, or a category of knowledge. Of them, <strong>[selected writings of] a category (could be vague) of knowledge is the most important kind [of reader].</strong>
 - ideally a reader contains all of the source texts needed for a class. Otherwise, it's usually up to the teacher to grab a pieces of text from all sorts of places and give out copies. <strong>This may be the most efficient way to read, as one doesn't waste time to fetch and gather several source materials</strong>, neither physically nor digitally
 - ex. Leach, Neil - Rethinking Architecture_ A Reader in Cultural Theory (Routledge, 1997)
 - (the <em>Viking Readers</em>, such as <em>The Portable Beat Reader</em>, mentioned under anthology fit here too)
 
 <h3><strong>anthology/sourcebook/source book</strong></h3>
 - selected writings of a single period of time?
 - <strong>this may be the most efficient way to understand a period of time, or the social development of minds of the time</strong>
 - <strong>there seems to be two kinds: fiction (poetry, [fiction] prose, drama, etc.) and non-fiction (history, biography, philosophy, essay, jouurnal/diary, travelogue, <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/the-public-sphere-during-the-second-sophistic">speeches, dialogues, letters, communicative action: verbal utterances that matter</a>). Of the two, the second kind is superior, because it tells of real communicative actions.</strong> To simply understand: People in the past may have read <em>Homer</em>, <em>Epic of Gilgamesh</em>, and <em>Journey to the West</em>, but that clearly doesn't represent the social reality of the world, and often, doesn't affect the social reality at all, just as media (entertainment) in contemporary society doesn't. The main use of literature to a historian is for the information, and it's up to the historian to decipher what is fictional and what isn't. Even then, <strong>it is better to read a history or biography [than fiction] written in or around that time</em> to obtain more information [about that time].</strong>
 
 <h4>fiction</h4>
 - ex. the <em>Viking Portable Library</em> series, the ones that have "Reader" in the title
 -- I have a bunch of these at home. Although an experience to read, it was probably a one-time experience: to see how language change over time, how minds change over time, what people write, what people were thinking about, history of literature aesthetic, etc. Although the format of the books are wonderfully basic, they are best left in in random locations in one's dwelling. <strong>I don't desire to read any fiction,</strong> just as <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/reading-is-often-actionless">I didn't desire to when I first began to read</a>.
 - ex. Mair, Victor H. - The Columbia History of Chinese Literature (Columbia, 2001)
 - ex. many editors - The Norton Anthology of World Literature (W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 2012)
 -- <strong>this seems like quite the feat, <a href="http://media.wwnorton.com/cms/contents/NAWOL_TOC_new.pdf">check out the contents</a></strong>
 -- alternative: Longman Anthology of World Literature
 - <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/list/show/4211.Anthologies?page=1">a Goodreads list of anthologies</a>
 -- see the eurocentrism yet?
 
 <h4>sourcebook</h4>
 - the terms sourcebook and the less commonly "source book" seem to be used for anthologies that mainly have translated writings (fiction and non-fiction), usually of ancient writings (as in probably written on stone or bamboo). "Source book" seems to be more commonly used for odd things like mysticism, table-top role-playing games, and science writings (because they are rarely read, except for a history of science).
 - ex. Radhakrishnan, Sarvepalli, Charles A. Moore - A Source Book in Indian Philosophy (Princeton, 1957)
 - ex. Chan, Wing-Tsit (Chen, Rongjie) - A Source Book in Chinese Philosophy (Princeton, 1969)
 - <strong>ex. <a href="http://legacy.fordham.edu/Halsall/index.asp">Internet History Sourcebooks Project</a></strong>
 -- this is a wildly ambitious project covering ancient, medieval, modern, and even, though comprehensively covered, African, East Asian, Global, Indian, Islamic, Jewish, and some special things, like history of science, women's history, LGBT history
 
 <h4>non-fiction</h4>
 - As I mention in <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/lessons-in-research-of-a-past-time">Lessons in Research of a Past Time</a>, <strong>there are many kinds of history books, mainly, political (traditional), social (modern), and specific social (modern). Similarly, there are many kinds of sourcebooks, thankfully, they can be divided into the same categories: social (modern) and social topic (modern, specific). A source political history book <em>is</em> the political (traditional) sourcebook.</strong>
 
 <h4>social sourcebook</h4>
 - <strong>these kinds of anthologies of sources of social/everday/daily life may be one of the best ways to understand the society/culture of the past time. This is documentation of reality. This is the equivalent of watching a documentary film. There's real knowledge to be had here. This is more important than philosophy. <em>This was reality</em>.</strong>
 - ex. Bagnall, Roger S., Peter Derow - The Hellenistic Period_ Historical Sources in Translation (Blackwell, Sourcebooks in Ancient History, 2003)
 -- "This book presents in translation 175 of the most revealing documents that have survived on stone and papyrus from the Hellenistic period.", ex. chapter: Social Relations and Private Life
 - ex. Parkin, Tim and Arthur Pomeroy - Roman Social History_ A Sourcebook (Routledge, Sourcebooks for the Ancient World, 2007)
 -- "this excellent resource covers original translations from sources such as inscriptions, papyri, and legal texts. Topics include: social inequality and class; games, gladiators and attitudes to violence; the role of slaves in Roman society; economy and taxation; the Roman legal system; the Roman family and gender roles."
 - ex. Shelton, Jo-Ann - As the Romans Did: A Sourcebook in Roman Social History (Oxford, 1998)
 - ex. Dillon, Matthew, Lynda Garland - Ancient Greece: Social and Historical Documents... (Routledge, Sourcebooks for the Ancient World, 2010)
 - ex. Dillon, Matthew, Lynda Garland - Ancient Rome (Routledge, Sourcebooks for the Ancient World, 2010)
 -- an observed trend: <strong>it seems critical theory publishers such as Routledge and Blackwell are on to publishing social sourcebooks, social topic sourcebooks, social histories, and social topic histories</strong>
 
 <h4>social topic sourcebook</h4>
 - Again, just as there are histories of social topics, there are sourcebooks of social topics. <strong>But as one can see, as the information becomes more and more organized, it becomes more and more insular, showing the ugly insular choice of elite schools' publications of solely Western civilizations. As one proceeds toward the particular in the order of the organization of sources (primary, sourcebook, social topic sourcebook), the world becomes smaller.</strong> There are many primary sources that haven't been translated. There are even more primary sources that haven't been compiled into a handy sourcebook. And there can be an infinite amount of social topic sourcebooks.
 - ex. Yardley J.C., Iain Mcdougall, Mark Joyal - Greek and Roman Education: A Sourcebook (Routledge Sourcebooks for the Ancient World)
 - ex. Wiedemann, Thomas - Greek and Roman Slavery (Routledge, Sourcebooks for the Ancient World, <strong>1980</strong>)
 - ex. Asmonti, Luca - Athenian Democracy: A Sourcebook (Bloomsbury Sources in Ancient History)
 - let's just use one social topic: women's history:
 -- <strong>by using one example, women in history, one can already the amount that has been and can be written, and one can see what people choosing to focus on / be socially aware about. People still read eurocentric sources, then write social histories about them! What a crazy insular world the world of physically printed material is. And most are published very recently! It seems, historians, stuck in the printed world, have perpetuated insulation as opposed to doing their sole job: to write new histories.</strong>
 - ex. MacLachlan, Bonnie - Women in Ancient Greece: A Sourcebook (Bloomsbury Sources in Ancient History, 2012)
 - ex. MacLachlan, Bonnie - Women in Ancient Rome: A Sourcebook (Bloomsbury Sources in Ancient History, 2013)
 - ex. Rowlandson, Jane - Women and Society in Greek and Roman Egypt: A Sourcebook (Cambridge, 1998)
 - ex. Johnson, Marguerite, Terry Ryan - Sexuality in Greek and Roman Literature and Society: A Sourcebook (Routledge, Sourcebooks for the Ancient World, 2005)
 -- <strong>and so the social problem of media [todo: link] continues. All other societies in any other space or time are ignored [excluded].</strong>
 
 history of literature (or a kind of literature)
 - selected writings of a period of time with writings to introduce the works
 - in case one doesn't feel like using Wikipedia while reading an anthology, <strong>this can be more or less efficient as reading an anthology</strong>, depending on the supplemental writing and formatting of the book
 - ex. Lin, Yutang, many others - The Wisdom of China and India (arhive.org, 030122mbp)
 - ex. Russell, Bertrand - History of Western Philosophy (Routledge, 1945)
 
 other weird things:
 <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/lessons-in-research-of-a-past-time">history</a>
 - <strong>history books written during the time one is investigating <em>is</em> a source, usually, the best source</strong>
 
 school textbook, or simply, textbook
 - some strange attempt at throwing a history of ideas within a category? <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_history">Intellectual history</a>?
 
 academic/scientific paper
 - forced writings?
 
 academic journal
 
 <h2>extraction of ideas</h2>
 Now, that we have the kinds of literature, <strong>how to get the ideas? If one simply wants words, then a quick Google of an ideas with "Wikipedia" in the search will likely lead to it.</strong> That's how I got most of my vocabulary/ideas. I'll try <em>Keywords: A Vocabulary of Culture and Society</em> and <em>The Theory Toolbox</em> book soon. <strong>Otherwise, ideas can come from any experience.</strong> After Wikipedia, my first book was a <em>History of Philosophy</em> (by Bertrand Russell, then Anthony Kenny to fill in gaps). That probably wasn't necessary, as it consists of the Western canon, but neither was it the worst place to begin in the written world. At my home I have a bunch of books from the <em>Viking Portable Library</em> series; Just finding that series in a bookstore could be heaven, as it consists solely of primary source texts from periods of time; Flipping through several <em>Viking</em> Readers was an experience. <strong>From my experience, essays or selected text (usually selected from an essay) seem to be the most concise formulation of the extracting and understanding of an idea via written communication. Essays or selected texts are usually given to students to read, as part of the syllabus. Without a syllabus, essays or selected works that contain ideas can be found in the excellent <em>Penguin Great Ideas</em> series; but it has no direction. Similarly, a reader, such as <em>The Place, People, and Space Reader</em> (by the CUNY environmental psychology department), is also excellent at transmitting ideas, <em>and</em> it has direction.</strong> The problem with readers, and all books, is that is it is not a real experience.
 
 That may be as far as I've got in my experience of reading, and trying to extract ideas. Those are the best sources I know of: <strong>They are the best because the editors select the text [from a primary source] which best forms an idea in the mind. No extra garbage text is added.</strong> Furthermore, <strong>Secondary texts are usually unnecessary, and generally do not provide nearly as much thought as the primary, because when reading primary sources the mind tries to grasp the author's mind. It's comparable to watching a Hollywood film as opposed to a documentary.</strong>
 
 Perhaps just <strong>reading a few <em>Penguin Great Ideas</em> books and a few readings (selected text) from a reader is enough. It's 2016. It's time to play some games, watch films, take the train, meetup, live it up. The ideas come tacitly, there's not need to explicate them. Perhaps Wikipedia was enough after all. No need to read.</strong> 6969 2016-05-22 18:00:49 2016-05-22 22:00:49 open closed the-kinds-of-literature-and-the-extraction-of-ideas publish 0 0 post 0 Art Communication Essays History Humanities Literature Organization Personal Philosophy Philosophy of Education Philosophy of Literature medium_post O:11:"Medium_Post":11:{s:16:"author_image_url";s:74:"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/200/200/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png";s:10:"author_url";s:28:"https://medium.com/@rahil627";s:11:"byline_name";N;s:12:"byline_email";N;s:10:"cross_link";s:2:"no";s:2:"id";s:12:"4f335d2bbbae";s:21:"follower_notification";s:3:"yes";s:7:"license";s:19:"all-rights-reserved";s:14:"publication_id";s:2:"-1";s:6:"status";s:6:"public";s:3:"url";s:93:"https://medium.com/@rahil627/the-kinds-of-literature-and-the-extraction-of-ideas-4f335d2bbbae";} _edit_last 1 _yoast_wpseo_primary_category 150 Lessons in Research of a Past Time http://rahilpatel.com/blog/lessons-in-research-of-a-past-time Mon, 23 May 2016 03:33:52 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=7011 [todo: working title: Lessons in Research of a Past Time via the written medium that is literature (written history?)]

 This writing was extracted from <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/the-public-sphere-during-the-second-sophistic">The Public Sphere during the Second Sophistic</a>. It developed while fetching books about the Second Sophistic, which occurred between the years 54 and 230.
 
 <h2>a few lessons in research of a past time via the written medium that is literature (written history?)</h2>
 I only retrieved this many sources because I've trapped myself near a library. Otherwise, [1] almost no one should ever go about researching via literature. It's an ancient way of doing things. Traveling across time through societies via literature results in far less information and than traveling across space through societies. Furthermore, it offers no real experience. I still stand by my maxim: a single walk through a city cannot be written. (Though it can be filmed...)
 
 [2] Ignore all secondary sources if the primary source exists. In this case, directly reading Philostratus <em>may</em> have been the best thing to do (which fits well into my reading list of ancient biographies after Plutarch and Suetonius), and the most efficient way to spend time. <em>I am the historian</em>, my critical mind, if interested, is able to deconstruct communication better than most. But I certainly wouldn't spend the time to actually attempt to write history: that is not my goal -- that's a passive's goal.
 
 [3] Only if the experience of reading the source text is too meaningless without more peripheral information, or, if the primary source is too lengthy or of bad quality, then one may turn toward a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_history">political (traditional, political event chronology) historian</a>. They seem to gather the primary sources, think a little -- not nearly as much as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_history">social (modern, cultural, all-sphere-encompassing) historian</a> --, and poop out a more cohesive single piece of writing. Literature misses the everyday life of the past which requires trying to place one's mind into the time, with all its cultural and material (environmental) realities, which is impossible even if one experienced that period of time (loss of information in the writing medium [todo: link relevant post]), but alas, 'tis the job of the modern historian. But even great historians are probably no fun to talk to.
 
 [4] If one simply wants to talk about something in particular, that what a certain kind of social historians are for: a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historiography#The_Cultural_turn">social(/cultural) topic historian</a>. They're modern, have a critical mind, and likely worth talking to. One can talk to these guys any time, on whatever subject one is interested in, but they don't provide broad neither broad social history or political history, they just offer conversation about something specific, some topic they found interesting in the past. Want to talk about the perception of Indians by Romans? You need to find a social topic historian. They're like the essayists of history. People can write about anything in the past, hundreds of pages worth, just as people can write about anything, as they do in essays. And that's where Eshleman's book came in.
 
 It's a book about the society of intellectuals in the Roman Empire. It's <em>not</em> a book about the Second Sophistic, nor is it a political history of it, nor is it a social history of it. That's the difference. One <em>could</em> read about the Second Sophistic from secondary sources or even primary sources, but if one's goal was to simply talk about the society of intellectuals in the Roman Empire, then reading this [a social topic history] may be sufficient.
 
 I imagine finding a book so specific is rare. I actually initially was interested in the social society of philosophers from Archaic to Classical Greece. How philosophers formed schools, what they did in everyday life, how they competed, etc. Then I stumbled upon this gem. Hurray for the Internet. Even the Internet, blog or journal or whatever, probably doesn't have much about this. The discourse can only be found in this book. Crazy.
 
 Blah, what a waste of time downloading the other books!

 <strong>Eshleman, Kendra - The Social World of Intellectuals in the Roman Empire_ Sophists, Philosophers, and Christians</strong> (Cambridge, <a href="http://www.cambridge.org/ie/academic/subjects/classical-studies/classical-studies-general/series/greek-culture-roman-world">Greek Culture in the Roman World</a>, 2012)
 - <strong><em>this book was the cause of this thought</em></strong>
 - <strong>this series of books is entirely composed of social topic histories; it serves as a good example of what social topics people at Oxford chose as recent as 2015</strong>
 -- "<em>Greek Culture in the Roman World offers a rich field for study. Extraordinary <strong>insights can be gained into processes of multicultural contact and exchange, political and ideological conflict, and the creativity of a polyglot, changing empire.</strong> This was also a period when many fundamental elements of Western society were being set in place: from the rise of Christianity, to an influential system of education, to long-lived artistic canons. This series is the first to focus on the response of Greek culture to its Roman imperial setting as a significant phenomenon in its own right. To that end, it will publish original and innovative research in the art, archaeology, epigraphy, history, philosophy, religion and literature of the Empire, with an emphasis on Greek material.</em>"

 <h2>examples of social/cultural history writings</h2>

 <h3>ancient</h3>
 - <strong>can't be written from experience, thus, a difficult task, requiring someone simultaneously highly tuned with contemporary life <em>and</em> ancient life</strong>, such as Edith Hamilton or Eileen Power, both of whom seem to be quite special women
 - usually covers a single society or nation-state (i.e. empire) over a period of time

 - <strong>Eaton, Richard - The New Cambridge History of India, Volume 1, Part 8: A Social History of the Deccan, 1300-1761: Eight Indian Lives (Cambridge)</strong>

 - Mommsen, Theodor - A History of Rome (<strong>1856</strong>)
 -- the only Nobel Prize awarded to a historian, includes both political and history. Ohhhh the humans futile attempts to organize the world!
 - popular "time-traveling" books: from a goodreads review by Pete daPixie: "There appears to be a plethora of historical time travelling books appearing, such as Matyszak's 'Ancient Rome on 5 denarii a day' and 'Ancient Athens on Five Drachmas a Day'. Mortimer's 'The Time Traveller's Guide to Medieval England: a Handbook for Visitors to the Fourteenth Century' was published in 2008"
 - <strong>Pelican [Books, main series], a now defunct (and <a href="https://www.pelicanbooks.com/">re-launched</a>!) educational imprint of Penguin, seems to had many social histories, not just written by insular academics, but by more caring, artist-teacher-types, written for the public, which probably made them so good.</strong>
 -- you know, I'm guessing <strong>these little books might be the best way to throw one's imagination into a past society</strong>, perhaps better than larger books because one can't carry that crap around or use an iPhone to listen to it, because it has a bunch of pictures, and it's simply to large to carry.

 Let's call them <em>ideal [time] periods</em>. Ideal being, an ideal in my mind at least.
 
 Continuing the search for a certain period of time where people created the greatest ethical and political philosophies. A time where people focused on these things. A time where people cared for one another.
 <h2>contents</h2>
 <strong>As societies urbanized, they needed to figure out as social/political solution, so it came out of necessity of the sudden growing dense areas.</strong> That’s the most common sense reason. For politics, and ethics?
 
 Then, it seems, one ethical system bested the others, unifying the cities with <em>benevolence</em> and <em>harmony</em>, resulting in a “peaceful” (no war, but still highly unequal society) golden age, until it became an empire (the most unequal).
 
 But this doesn’t say anything about what’s most important: capital and capitalism in the cities: the motivation of work. The slaves that powered the classical ages and empires.
 <blockquote>He argues that credit systems originally developed as means of account long before the advent of coinage, which appeared around 600 BC. Credit can still be seen operating in non-monetary economies. Barter, on the other hand, seems primarily to have been used for limited exchanges between different societies that had infrequent contact and often were in a context of ritualized warfare.
 …
 Graeber suggests that economic life originally related to social currencies. These were closely related to routine non-market interactions within a community. This created an “everyday communism” based on mutual expectations and responsibilities among individuals. This type of economy is contrasted with exchange based on formal equality and reciprocity (but not necessarily leading to market relations) and hierarchy. The hierarchies in turn tended to institutionalize inequalities in customs and castes.</blockquote>
 <ul>
 <li>in line with first to second stage Marxist social development</li>
 </ul>
 <blockquote>...The great Axial Age civilizations (800–200 BC) began to use coins to quantify the economic values of portions of what Graeber calls “human economies”. Graeber says these civilizations held a radically different conception of debt and social relations. These were based on the radical incalculability of human life and the constant creation and recreation of social bonds through gifts, marriages, and general sociability. The author postulates the growth of a “military–coinage–slave complex” around this time. These were enforced by mercenary armies that looted cities and cut human beings from their social context to work as slaves in Greece, Rome, and elsewhere. The extreme violence of the period marked by the rise of great empires in China, India, and the Mediterranean was, in this way, <strong>connected with the advent of large-scale slavery and the use of coins to pay soldiers. This was combined with obligations to pay taxes in currency: The obligation to pay taxes with money required people to engage in monetary transactions, often with very disadvantageous terms of trade. This typically increased debt and slavery.</strong>
 <cite>Wikipedia, <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt:_The_First_5000_Years">Debt: The First 5000 Years</a></cite></blockquote>
 <ul>
 <li>and so <strong>capitalism was introduced in the classical age, institutionalized, and at its apex during the empire age.</strong> Sounds like Dubai.</li>
 </ul>
 Surely <strong>after that one must desire some purer ethical treatises to get out of that extreme form of capitalism and violence.</strong>
 
 Argh, even in 600BC, one can’t escape capitalism! I’ve spent so much time getting away from it, and even traveling through time, I must go back at least 2600 years. <strong>How can one ever escape capitalism? It’s spatially <em>and</em> temporally impossible!</strong>
 
 So, anyway, it’s pretty difficult to tell how much capital affected people’s action as opposed to ethics of their philosophies. I’m guessing Confucius China was far less motivated by capital (“profit”) than the Europeans. Bhuddist India too. The influence of philosophies still show in both countries’ contemporary cultures. So, after all, it was the Europeans that were most ruthless, most extreme, the Roman Empire being the apex of ruthlessness, killing for coins, just to make a living.
 
 Anyway, what was I looking for? <strong>A certain flourishing period of time? Im not sure. Maybe China’s Han Dynasty is best? They don’t seem to have had a caste system, and likely were more peaceful than Romans, and I read that they were prolific inventors.</strong>
 
 Or was I looking for <strong>a prolific time where people thought about ways a society can live? I guess there aren’t any other times: around 600BC most of the civilizations created coins. Thus, one must look to other civilizations, precisely at the time when a society begins to urbanize, and better before the invention of coinage</strong>
 
 Hmm, <strong>I wonder about the geographic view. If urbanization caused people to think of ways to socially organize, was coinage the real solution? (As opposed to ethical precepts.) Then, did other civilizations simply copy that idea (maybe for trade?)? Then, the newly founded social system, capitalism, caused some kind of psychological madness to the point of slave-driving an empire and conquering others (Hi America!)? Then, as a reaction to that madness, people reverted to a morally better religion/ethical precepts?</strong>
 
 This shit is crazy. I’m done with history!
 
 Actually, I think was just looking for a period of time where people thought about others, focused on politics and ethics as opposed to [instituinalized, capitalistic] work, not only in the sense of creatively thinking about ways a society can live and govern itself, rather, more simply, just more focused on each other, being aware of one another. <strong>[Perhaps I was seeking] The most socially aware period of time [in the development of a society].</strong> An empire, by the definition, is a stage of society that is least socially aware. <strong>Perhaps it was indeed before coins were introduced, that people focused on other people, and not coins, or useless wage labour.</strong>
 
 Well, I first began to read Meditations by Marcus Aurelius because I wanted to become less aware of social problems. I was hyper-aware, and it was damaging my life. By reading Stoic philosophy, I thought I could be less aware, and it worked a bit. It’s not too bad. What’s bad is knowing that a Roman Emporer did not care for social problems. He wasn’t just unaware, he was decidedly unaware. Like Epictetus, he didn’t let external things bother him, and suggests others shouldn’t. To use one’s mind, free will, to do what they want, but not to grind against society, instead, flow with it naturally. What makes it difficult to digest is that it’s the Roman Empire. He spent much time on the field, battling. Was war simply determinism, fate for him? Stoicism makes sense for the time, to be calm and not be afraid of dying, just as Zen Buddhism made sense, but in contemporary society, it’s a terrible set of ethics.
 
 Then I thought the Second Sophistic was great. Sophists, the artist-educator-senator-public-orating-philosophers, were free, independent [of institutions], debating in the public, talking to Emporers without beauracracy, creating their own schools; a huge part of society. Yet, again, thinking of the history of the Roman Empire, it’s difficult to admire them too. Did they try to socially organize against problems? I guess I’ll know when I read some of Cicero’s speeches.

 <h2 class="minus">highlights and notes from Wikipedia</h2>
 https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_world:
 <blockquote>Beginning in the 8th century BCE, the so-called “Axial Age” saw a set of transformative religious and philosophical ideas develop, mostly independently, in many different locations. During the 6th century BCE, Chinese Confucianism,[53][54] Indian Buddhism and Jainism, and Jewish Monotheism all developed. (Karl Jaspers’ Axial Age theory also includes Persian Zoroastrianism on this list, but other scholars dispute Jaspers’ timeline for Zoroastrianism.) In the 5th century BCE Socrates and Plato made significant advances in the development of Ancient Greek philosophy.
 
 In the east, three schools of thought were to dominate Chinese thinking until the modern day. These were Taoism,[55] Legalism[56] and Confucianism.[57] The Confucian tradition, which would attain dominance, looked for political morality not to the force of law but to the power and example of tradition. Confucianism would later spread into the Korean peninsula and toward Japan.
 …
 From around 550 BCE, many independent kingdoms and republics known as the Mahajanapadas were established across the subcontinent.
 …
 Regional Empires (Age of Empires):
 The millennium from 500 BCE to 500 CE saw a series of empires of unprecedented size develop. Well-trained professional armies, unifying ideologies, and advanced bureaucracies created the possibility for emperors to rule over large domains, whose populations could attain numbers upwards of tens of millions of subjects. The great empires depended on military annexation of territory and on the formation of defended settlements to become agricultural centres.[65] The relative peace that the empires brought encouraged international trade, most notably the massive trade routes in the Mediterranean, the maritime trade web in the Indian Ocean, and the Silk Road. In southern Europe, the Greeks (and later the Romans), in an era known as “Classical Antiquity,” established cultures whose practices, laws, and customs are considered the foundation of contemporary western civilization.</blockquote>
 <ul>
 <li>perhaps ones must look at these empires for some real philosophy (link to second sophists, real philosophy). In the axial age people scrambled and created social structures, such as ethical treatises, to maintain stability (or in the negative: hagemony). In the empires age, people maintained society by the forcing capitalism culture upon others. Hmmm.</li>

 </ul>
 <blockquote>After the Kalinga War, the Empire experienced nearly half a century of peace and security under Ashoka. Mauryan India also enjoyed an era of social harmony, religious transformation, and expansion of the sciences and of knowledge. Chandragupta Maurya’s embrace of Jainism increased social and religious renewal and reform across his society, while Ashoka’s embrace of Buddhism has been said to have been the foundation of the reign of social and political peace and non-violence across all of India. Ashoka sponsored the spreading of Buddhist ideals into Sri Lanka, Southeast Asia, West Asia[9] and Mediterranean Europe.[3]</blockquote>

 <blockquote>These inscriptions proclaim Ashoka’s adherence to the Buddhist philosophy which, as in Hinduism is called dharma, “Law”. The inscriptions show his efforts to develop the Buddhist dharma throughout his kingdom. Although Buddhism and the Gautama Buddha are mentioned, the edicts focus on social and moral precepts rather than specific religious practices or the philosophical dimension of Buddhism.
 
 "Ten years (of reign) having been completed, King Piodasses (one of the titles of Ashoka: Piyadassi or Priyadarsi, “He who is the beloved of the Gods and who regards everyone amiably”) made known (the doctrine of)
 Piety (Greek:εὐσέβεια, Eusebeia) to men; and from this moment he has made men more pious, and everything thrives throughout the whole world. And the king abstains from (killing) living beings, and other men and those who (are) huntsmen and fishermen of the king have desisted
 from hunting. And if some (were) intemperate, they
 have ceased from their intemperance as was in their power; and obedient to their father and mother and to the elders, in opposition to the past also in the future, by so acting on every occasion, they will live betterand more happily." (Trans. by G. P. Carratelli[4])</blockquote>

 <blockquote>Ashoka showed great concern for fairness in the exercise of justice, caution and tolerance in the application of sentences, and regularly pardoned prisoners.
 
 When Ashoka embraced Buddhism in the latter part of his reign, he brought about significant changes in his style of governance, which included providing protection to fauna, and even relinquished the royal hunt. He was perhaps the first ruler in history to advocate conservation measures for wildlife.
 
 However, the edicts of Ashoka reflect more the desire of rulers than actual events; the mention of a 100 ‘panas’ (coins) fine for poaching deer in royal hunting preserves shows that rule-breakers did exist. The legal restrictions conflicted with the practices then freely exercised by the common people in hunting, felling, fishing and setting fires in forests.</blockquote>

 Along roads I have had banyan trees planted so that they can give shade to animals and men, and I have had mango groves planted.

Such things to make the people happy have been done by former kings. I have done these things for this purpose, that the people might practice the Dhamma. Pilar Edict Nb7 (S. Dhammika)}}</blockquote>

 <blockquote>The Heian period (平安時代 Heian jidai?) is the last division of classical Japanese history, running from 794 to 1185.[1] The period is named after the capital city of Heian-kyō, or modern Kyōto. It is the period in Japanese history when Buddhism, Taoism and other Chinese influences were at their height. The Heian period is also considered the peak of the Japanese imperial court and noted for its art, especially poetry and literature.</blockquote>

 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recluse_literature:
 <blockquote>The origins of the literary style known as Recluse Literature has roots in the Taoist movement in China, said to date back to the 3rd or 4th century BCE. Like the recluses of Japan, Taoist philosophers such as Zhuangzi and Laozi advocated a casting off of the bonds of society and government, and instead living a life free of obligations and the pressures of urban life. The first Japanese recluse is considered to be Saigyō Hōshi, who worked as a guard to retired Emperor Toba until the age of 22, at which time for reasons unknown he took the vows of a monk and proceeded to live alone for long periods of time. Following the relocation of the capital from Heian (present day Kyoto) to Kamakura, located 50 km south-south-west of Tokyo, many court aristocrats, due mainly to the influence of Jōdo shū or Pure Land Buddhism, became disillusioned with the standards and practices of government and every day life, and instead chose to live on the outskirts of civilization in isolation. The practice of taking the tonsure (becoming a monk) after life in the Imperial court was not entirely new to Japan, but the concept of doing so and completely retreating from secular life into nature, as opposed to the many Buddhist monasteries around the capital, was considered a novel alternative to these newly disillusioned intellectuals. From this isolation, it was common practice for the recluse to focus his efforts on self-reflection, expressed through the arts such as poetry or the writing of zuihitsu-styled essays.</blockquote>

 </ul>
 <blockquote>The genre next gained momentum as a respectable form of writing several centuries later in the Kamakura Period. With the depotentiation of the Heian Court and the relocation of the capital to Kamakura, near modern-day Tokyo, many intellectuals, amidst social chaos, grew disillusioned and chose to live in asceticism – a trend that also reflected the growing importance of Pure Land Buddhism. Writing from isolation, these authors reflected on the degeneracy of their contemporaries, whom they considered philistines, in comparison to themselves, as well as general consideration of the impermanence of the material world. Major works from this period include Kamo no Chōmei's Hōjōki and Yoshida Kenkō’s Tsurezuregusa.</blockquote>

The period was characterized by economic growth, strict social order, isolationist foreign policies, a stable population, popular enjoyment of arts and culture, recycling of materials, and sustainable forest management.

 <li>this lady seems to be investigating the period capitalism rises in society for the West, in English farms, apparently, probably after simply noticing when several political theorists came about. There's a section on precapitalist societies. Maybe should read Debt by Graeber first?</li>
 </ul>
 The problem is that all of the books go over how capitalism rises solely for the west. What about every other society? <strong>I want to see how capitalism rises in every society.</strong> Did it just come by imitation? Also, if coinage came in 600BC, how is that different from capitalism in 1700? To me capitalism is simply the use of currency, not the industrial revolution, or whenever a few control the mean of production.
 
 https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalism
 <blockquote>Capital has existed incipiently on a small scale for centuries,[35] in the form of merchant, renting and lending activities, and occasionally as small-scale industry with some wage labour. Simple commodity exchange, and consequently simple commodity production, which are the initial basis for the growth of capital from trade, have a very long history. The "capitalistic era" according to Karl Marx dates from 16th century merchants and small urban workshops.[36] Marx knew that wage labour existed on a modest scale for centuries before capitalist industry. Early Islam promulgated capitalist economic policies, which migrated to Europe through trade partners from cities such as Venice.[37] Capitalism in its modern form can be traced to the emergence of agrarian capitalism and mercantilism in the Renaissance.[38]
 
 Thus for much of history, capital and commercial trade existed, but it did not lead to industrialisation or dominate the production process of society. That required a set of conditions, including specific technologies of mass production, the ability to independently and privately own and trade in means of production, a class of workers willing to sell their labour power for a living, a legal framework promoting commerce, a physical infrastructure allowing the circulation of goods on a large scale, and security for private accumulation. Many of these conditions do not currently exist in many Third World countries, although there is plenty of capital and labour. Thus, the obstacles for the development of capitalist markets are less technical and more social, cultural and political.</blockquote>
 <ul>
 <li>makes sense for why Asians can live off of a food stands / booths: the culture allows it -- dense settlement and not much law/beauracracy makes it viable. Try setting one up in the suburbs only to lose to a fast food joint.</li>
 </ul>
 <blockquote>Capitalism is an economic system based on private ownership of the means of production and their operation for profit.[1][2][3] Characteristics central to capitalism include private property, capital accumulation, wage labor, voluntary exchange, a price system, and competitive markets.[4][5] In a capitalist market economy, decision-making and investment is determined by the owners of the factors of production in financial and capital markets, and prices and the distribution of goods are mainly determined by competition in the market.[6][7]
 
 Economists, political economists, and historians have adopted different perspectives in their analyses of capitalism and have recognized various forms of it in practice. These include laissez-faire or free market capitalism, welfare capitalism, and state capitalism. Different forms of capitalism feature varying degrees of free markets, public ownership,[8] obstacles to free competition, and state-sanctioned social policies. The degree of competition in markets, the role of intervention and regulation, and the scope of state ownership vary across different models of capitalism;[9] the extent to which different markets are free, as well as the rules defining private property, are matters of politics and of policy. Most existing capitalist economies are mixed economies, which combine elements of free markets with state intervention, and in some cases, with economic planning.[10]
 
 Capitalism has existed under many forms of government, in many different times, places, and cultures. Following the decline of mercantilism, mixed capitalist systems became dominant in the Western world and continue to spread.</blockquote>

 "Agrarian capitalism"
 <blockquote>The economic foundations of the feudal agricultural system began to shift substantially in 16th-century England; the manorial system had broken down, and land began to become concentrated in the hands of fewer landlords with increasingly large estates. Instead of a serf-based system of labor, workers were increasingly employed as part of a broader and expanding money-based economy. The system put pressure on both landlords and tenants to increase the productivity of agriculture to make profit; the weakened coercive power of the aristocracy to extract peasant surpluses encouraged them to try better methods, and the tenants also had incentive to improve their methods, in order to flourish in an competitive labor market. Terms of rent for land were becoming subject to economic market forces rather than to the previous stagnant system of custom and feudal obligation.[39][40]</blockquote>

 <blockquote>[self-note: this was published using markdown, and is a good for testing it. The original text is in a text file in Dropbox. Can either copy the HTML from the text file using an application (Writebox) or use the Wordpress markdown plugin. It seems I may have been playing with the formatting of highlights and notes, using unordered lists (via markdown), which led to some cosmetic updates to the CSS. I don't know how to write a non-html-list in markdown using "\n- text". I really sure hope all this messing with digital bullshit will make expressing thoughts easier during more active times in life...</blockquote>
 
 It might be helpful to write down the workflow, perhaps minimizing it.
 
 Here is my current workflow:
 1. experience
 2. think
 - non-verbal / skip to action, oral (in the mind or out loud)
 3. decide to write
 - written is a choice among infinite choices of actions
 4. express via writing to nearest material
 - paper, public computer, smartphone
 - audio recording an alternative worth considering
 if written on physical material:
 - 4.5 transcribe to digital text file
 5. publish to Wordpress
 
 
 Here is my current workflow with current technology:
 if using phone:
 write via a writing (likely markdown-supported) smartphone application (Writebox, Plaintext [2], Byword)
 copy text or HTML to clipboard
 paste into Wordpress [web browser (because the Wordpress application sucks)]
 - possibility: can purchase an update for Byword to publish to Wordpress
 -- this [Byword publishing feature] might be worth purchasing*
 --- is it worth looking at alternative writing smartphone applications for publishing feature?: iaWriter*, Elements: Design, nvALT and WriteRoom*, MarsEdit, Ulysses (and Daedelus Touch), Desk [PM], Nebulous Notes. No. Stick to the simply wonderful Byword*.
 
 if not:
 write directly via Wordpress (if near / convenient; it never is convenient)
 write to a text file using Writebox
 - Writebox is multi-platform, including web browsers, making it simple to use from any personal computer. This is the closing thing to physical paper. 7645 2016-06-03 02:38:42 2016-06-03 06:38:42 open closed my-workflow-for-written-expression publish 0 0 post 0 Art Humanities Literature Organization Personal Philosophy of Literature Thoughts medium_post O:11:"Medium_Post":11:{s:16:"author_image_url";s:74:"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/200/200/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png";s:10:"author_url";s:28:"https://medium.com/@rahil627";s:11:"byline_name";N;s:12:"byline_email";N;s:10:"cross_link";s:2:"no";s:2:"id";s:12:"23bd5845b1a4";s:21:"follower_notification";s:3:"yes";s:7:"license";s:19:"all-rights-reserved";s:14:"publication_id";s:2:"-1";s:6:"status";s:6:"public";s:3:"url";s:76:"https://medium.com/@rahil627/my-workflow-for-written-expression-23bd5845b1a4";} _edit_last 1 _yoast_wpseo_primary_category 186 Philosophy of Music http://rahilpatel.com/blog/philosophy-of-music Fri, 10 Jun 2016 03:44:46 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=7709 [this is a drafty mess transcribed from paper.

 I finally got some <a href="http://www.head-fi.org/t/561951/philips-she3580-iem-review-how-can-something-sound-so-good-for-10">cheap, yet amazingly good, headphones</a>. Listening to them reminds me of a past time of my life -- programming for capital in VA [Virginia, USA], commuting to college, doing chore-like work at home (repetitive organizing on the computer); Now I'm able to see that the way I survived the suburbs is because I abused music.
 
 <strong>Using technology is not normal. It is much slower to communicate through technology than it is to simply talk</strong> -- within one's head, out loud, or through writing. Technology distracts thinking and communicating.
 .
 <strong>Music interrupts, blocks thinking and communicating.</strong> To blog, for instance, I may need to connect to the internet, charge my digital device. Looking at my blog may distract further, directing thought toward design -- trying to make it more readable, increasing interaction. It [technology] distracts from the content, from the act of writing, the act of thought expression. 
 .
 Music blocks thinking. It's the only way to act, it seems. To take an action that is not communication nor survival, one must drug onelsef with more ot push one's body to act.
 
 With more, people organize, over-organize, over-work, over-accumulate capital. They forget to talk. <strong>Asia talks; America works.</strong> In Taiwan, reading is common (though likely passively), a common way to communicate. In America, new arts are created to communicate which all require more work (game-making!) to communicate the message compared to human language. Why not just communicate via human language? (<strong>Maybe music blocks people from expressing through human language.</strong>)
 .
 <strong>It also may block thought of the environment.</strong> It helps people focus on something -- media, art, material, <a href="https://tavaana.org/sites/default/files/raymond-williams-keywords.pdf">"work"</a>, but rarely does it lead to talking to people nearby, to thinking about how the environemnt came to be, history, others, social problems, etc. <strong>It is a mind-altering drug, one that inhibits verbal expression.</strong>
 
 <h2>page 2?</h2>
 I believe I was at <strong>a point of only acting to communicate</strong>. I didn't do anything else. <strong>I'd talk to the people around me, then, to books, then run out of energy and collapse, partly because my body had become fail, partly because capitalism doesn't allow that kind of life of mind. It prefers a life of bodily action, of movement of commodity. The movement of commodity is the opposite of the movement of meanings (communication). It is detestable, a chore, it provokes humans to abuse music; whereas communication is enjoyable, not requiring music.</strong>
 
 If joy comes from the creation of communication, then the creation of commoidity requires a kind of drug to make-up for the lack of enjoyment. It is ideal to creat ecommodity whilst creating communicationl but that isn't always possible (though, technology helps immensely here, with eBook listening, audio-recording, telephones, etc.). Eventually, either from habit of work, habit of listening to music, one nearly forgets to communicate. That's frightening, because that's the difference between a person who expresses and one that doesn't, the difference between a free mind and a restricted mind. [A free person and restricted person {slave}?] America is full of restricted minds. Asia is full of free minds.
 
 <strong>The West prioritizes media, the communication through mediums. The East prioritizes [direct] communication</strong>, even in it's simply a conversation with a friend. There is much widsom in the people as opposed to media. It doesn't distribute well, but it's a healthy lifestyle. The West begins with (Plato and) Aristotle. The East relies on the oral world which retains the culture. Culture is not distributed through media; It is through human interaction, direct communication. That is opposite of the culture industry of America. [todo: should continue*****].
 
 [todo: epistemology of music]
 
 [todo: action and music]
 
 Without music I only act toward survival and communication -- the socio-political expressions. Music allows me to live unsocially. It gives energy without people. I <em>needed</em> people during my time in Asia. I was <em>dependent</em> on people. <em><a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/capitalistic-behavior">I strived to do everything with people</a></em> [todo: need anchor to Taiwan section]. I tried to socio-politically cooperate to strive toward ideals (civic, social, design). I didn't work, I just communicated.
 
 <h2>page 3?</h2>
 America has been running on music at least since slaves worked to their own creative folk tunes; Now, white brokers on Wall street work while listening to hip-hop. Maybe the creation of music is skewed toward the working class because they need it to get by, influenced and inspired by it, mimic the creation of it, listening to raps about wage-labor whilst laboring for wage. I sure did -- through game, film, and fine arts / new media. That expression, anti-capitalism in America is perhaps the strongest emotion in American culture, perhaps even more-so than love (all forms of it). And it [the creation capitalism-influenced art] probably has not been broken since capitalism has existed.
 
 <h2>last page?</h2>
 That is why the East lacks art through mediums -- most is expression through oral communication, then to written communication, then lastly to other mediums. The history of the complex part of Eastern art is perhaps solely literature. <strong>It is <em>because</em> America listens to music that they [tend to] communicate through mediums.</strong>
 
 digression: How is communication prioritized? I guess that's left to attention. Communication is just information.

 Music is awful. It blocks thinking. Gives energy, for physical exercise, but actions are not thought of, just taken. It blocks thinking before taking an action. The decision-making phase is skipped. Is this action? Is this life? How can such mindlessness be?

 Recently, at least for the past two months, but perhaps up to the past two years, I've been living, communicating heavily through media. It can be seen through <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/valuable-things-ive-written#philosophy_vi">my recent writings</a>. But more recently, perhaps only within the past month, or since my last post related to history, I stopped communicating. <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/philosophy-of-music">I bought a pair of headphones, and broke my link to the social world</a>. It reverted my life mode to what feels identical to my childhood: no social life, relying on media and nature to keep me alive -- music, biking, playing games. A life mode seemingly more primitive. It doesn't ask questions about actions nor does it question decisions. It simply lives.
 
 What's been coming to mind often is the disbelief that I lived in such a way for so long. Is it normal? Or did I live a strangely unsocial childhood? Is it normal for American suburbia / caused by the environment?...
 
 Not long ago I experienced the opposite: I didn't want to take an action without others. I didn't even want to wake up, or shower. Where's the fun without doing things without others? So the contrast creates that disbelief.
 
 "Is it normal?" Maybe in the culture of more rural areas, suburbia: less dense areas. It's just so much more easier and resultingly happier to take actions with people in dense areas: to help the people spatially near. Perhaps even natural. If that's true, then my childhood was indeed unnatural -- that word more precise than abnormal.
 
 "Did I live a strangely unsocial childhood?" Don't all children wander around playfully with their toys? I do feel I spent a lot more time obsessively organizing things: my music library (during the time of just-post-Napster), my film library (during Netflix DVD-by-mail), and so on. Heck, I've just recently <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/valuable-things-ive-written">done this with my own writings</a>.
 ...
 I think what I felt strange about it was that I just feel I spent so much time with not-so-communicative-media (music) as opposed to communicating with people or more-communicative-media (documentary, writings). Of most priority, in general, the difference in time I spend with people during my time in Asia compared to my childhood feels infinite.
 ...
 Every hour I could be thinking about the various people around me, what to do with them, whereas in America, I wouldn't. It's <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/social-life-in-proximity">that spatial difference for me</a>
 ...
 In America I was okay doing things alone; I had my own narrow thought and directions. In Asia, I took into consideration the infinite factors of a society.
 x...
 Perhaps my childhood wasn't too unsocial, as I always wanted to play games with people all night.
 ...
 But playing games and riding bikes was something <em>I</em> wanted to do, and not everyone else in society wanted. I rarely did things I didn't care for: cooking, pro-sports, whatever other kids (and adults?) do (???). So those activities were still directional.
 ...
 It wasn't until I moved to the city that I actually tried other things, that I may not have cared for much, but because I could do it socially, without exclusivity, I did. I'd join any free event, art event, workshops, etc.. <strong>Somehow, denoting that an activity was an event lured me in.</strong> [todo: it wasn't denoting an activity, rather, having the knowledge that one could join an event and it actually existing in a nearby time-space, as opposed to creating an activity in my hometown] I could have done the same things at home, with my friends and family, but now that there was information denoting what was going on, I joined. Actions to be taken were written in the form of a human language. <em>The event-makers of cities shaped my actions for the limited times they had.</em> They were the game-makers, social game-makers.
 x...
 Back to the huge contrast between childhood and Asia:
 To have people as the focus of my mind, what gets attention as opposed to not. To go to Humans of Taipei and critical theory from wanting to play a video game. It <em>is</em> a huge difference. In the past media kept me awake: music and games. Now, people keep me awake: any nearby relations. Perhaps the problem is that unlike <strong>the continuity, immortality of media, social relations can be lost, and losing them during the more Asian way of life leads to social death.</strong> | <strong>I socially died once I lost my social connections. I lost them because I became (habitually) stuck in a place (spatially) due to economic problems.</strong> | <strong>Thus, I must live in a social place (hostel, public space, a place close to a public space [in a city]), or make the place I live in social. Furthermore, I must not let the negative culture of the space resides in (capitalism, consumerism, etc.) drive me out. Then what?: the inevitable: fight it or create my own.</strong>
 ...
 It is indeed natural to desire to do things socially, and other than the times in which I desired to ride bikes or play games with my friends, in retrospect it does seem my childhood was unnatural.

 Perhaps it's a matter of focus. Before, I focused on media, later on people, minds. During my time of travel I observed what people did, questioned why, like an anthropologist. Those people often focused on material things, most of all: media. It was clear while traveling that one can see the city-dwellers using their smartphones whilst riding public transportation as opposed to <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/">talking to the people nearby to gain wisdom</a>. And it was only in those spaces (hostels especially, public spaces, etc.) -- no institution, including the most recent one (NTU) -- that life could be found. Here were people that [todo: self-note, writing session 2, after food break] focused on other people. Their goal was to go out with another person just to join or create an activity to do with even more people, often an event in which the focus are people. It's about going out with an American traveler to showing her the neighborhoods I like in Taipei, allowing her to see its beauty, and together, with the night market vendors, engage in an activity. It's about joining a local surfer for a lesson, surfing, and eating, and taking, and sleeping at the surf shop worker apartment. It's about joining a volunteer for a volunteer building project, eating and meeting more volunteers, building together, and sleeping at a temple together. It's the time of sharing experiences that mattered most. [hmmm, well that drifted off-topic... Well maybe not:]
 ...
 Often times, more than one's individual directions and desires. The social, shared experience would beat the individual directions, and the choice between going out with hostel-mates as opposed to making video games slanted greatly toward the social choice. Surely I would try to match my directions by making them social, but it wasn't always possible. <strong>And when it didn't exist in society, I changed motives.</strong> Instead of thinking about and making media, I changed to thinking about local people and making things with them. Should I have stuck to my directions / teach others to explore the directions with me?; just as I explored on my bike, trying to get friends to join me on my biking adventures? Is it a matter of becoming more narrow and specific that leads to less socialness? It seems <strong>explorers must learn to go about alone, or learn to teach</strong>. An explorer's life or ethics should not be compared to others, because there is nothing it can be compared to: it is unique.
 
 But my change from making media to desiring to change culture, to affect human behavior in more direct ways was a good one. It was good to have those social experiences, or else, well, I'd be stuck in the suburbs making trite games. So <strong>having an individual direction isn't enough; it needs a social component.</strong> Or else, one is simply stuck in some isolated culture, an isolated state of mind. Rather, <strong>life is comprised of both, taking individual strides in unexplored directions and being open to the social lives around</strong>. Balancing them is something I still haven't figured out. I've been to both extremes. Those extremes, are what I usually ascribe to the stereotype or culture of America and culture of Taiwan. <strong>American culture is to be narrow-minded, single-directioned. Taiwan culture is to be open-minded (cultures, minds, lives), without direction.</strong>
 ...
 <strong>To work toward something <strong>is</strong> to have direction. To observe others is to not. One must work and observe.</strong> Attention must be able to sway from observing the world and working. One shouldn't become dependent on them, especially the point of socially dying when not progressing in either direction. <strong>One must not be dependent on either work or people: both are temporal.</strong> Either one can fly in and out of life. One shouldn't wake up to desire to work toward a project or to spend time with another person. There must be another reason. (How do imprisoned people live on? Is their livelihood even considered living?) No, no reason. <strong>Don't attach reason to living. Life is not to be reduced to a set of ethics. Life is whatever the next day brings it.</strong> To have goals, desires for those goals, leads to same trap as anticipation does: it builds false optimistic ends. <strong>Never anticipate, never desire.</strong> By desiring better human behavior, better decision-making, better cultures, I've nearly destroyed myself.
 .
 <strong>Work, but expect nothing from it. Observe, but accept no truth from it.</strong>...
 .
 But then, without desire, how can one wake up? That sounds like the life of a passion-less zombie. In the past I woke up because I either desired to do something (personal art, observing through media, observing reality, interacting with reality) or was simply content with being open to the world around me. <strong>To do something closer to the world around me was most satisfying.</strong> To do something narrow, further from the world around me, likely unsocial, was perhaps, less so. Though, I think I had a pretty good time with films in high school and books more recently. The answer to the question, <strong>how does one work and be open</strong>, is a difficult one.
 
 <strong>Perhaps they are opposing modes of life. They simply cannot be done simultaneously, as one ever so desires. One must simultaneously desire both and balance them. Desire to work. Desire to listen.</strong> | <strong>Listening is education. Work is practice. Just as practice alters with education, work alters with listening.</strong> Avoid the extremes I ascribe to the stereotypical American and Taiwanese cultures. Avoid extremes in general. Work and listen. Listen and work. Desire both. Do both. When focused too much on one side, spend time on the other, and vice versa.
 
 I think that's it. In this recent past, <strong>being alone in my mind, I've finally went to that lonely childhood being, and it's frighteningly different from my post-VA being: I went from one extreme to another. The problem is that I shouldn't have ever been at either extreme. I focused too much in my own work recently, and too much on the world before that. I can never find the balance.</strong> Hopefully living with a few good people I will get closer.

 [todo: these were written during the first session, but I ended up focusing on the above point]
 What's also clear is how different my life is from post-VA to pre-SF. It seems I gradually became more social since I left my parent's home in VA until I became dependent on being social to take actions in Taiwan, only to revert to independence now. I began with shared roommates in SF, then volunteer organizations and art organizations in NY, then work exchange and hostels in Asia. Spatially, things got closer too, to the point I slept with the people I am socially closest with...
 
 It seems post-VA that I had the energy to keep trying to socially communicate my actions with people. I was searching for people, simultaneously changing myself in the course of searching. That constant searching itself kind of became my life mode. I'd search, find, settle for a few months, then move on. The point was that I kept being social; being a part of society, and that was markedly different from my VA life. Perhaps my social dependence began post-VA, or at least began developing.

 [todo: written without editing]
 
 During active times I think about <a href="http:\\www.rahilpatel.com">what I can do within the time and space</a>. But what varies in a large amount, depending on the state of mind, is what can be done (in my mind) and can't, or more precisely, what is not thought of.
 
 What can or cannot be done is a matter of mind. Anything <em>can</em> be done. But the mind creates rules, through state (laws), culture (customs), peers (pressure), and self (ethics). Depending on the state of mind, the rules of mind may change, and therefore, possible actions change.
 
 For example, if I want to talk about neighborhood problems, during a more active time, I may just begin asking neighbors, any one in the neighborhood, anyone near me. During a less active time, I'm more likely to find some kind of social organization to talk to.
 
 If I want to talk about anything, I am able to talk to anyone nearby about it, similar to how Boar is able to talk to anyone about her personal problems, including the apartment receptionist / security.
 
 Another example, if I want to go to another town and its late, during a more active time, I would try going (catch transport, hitchhike), if something stops me, I'll physically stop there. During a less active time, I'd probably plan where to eat and sleep. My problem is that I rarely am able to follow plans: schedules, times, etc, so the former works better for me, feels more progressive, and is a more active life.
 
 Physical needs (food, toilet, air conditioner, floor to sleep on) should not be prioritized, yet, they cannot be ignored.
 
 As thought and action separate, level of activity decreases, until a vegetable thinking state is reached.
 
 Another example, if I want to run an event or some kind of activity, I may just run in on the street, or a nearby venue [this is a good epistemological pro of the city]. If I were less active, then I'd over-plan it and never do it.
 
 Another example, if I want to create something with material, I'd ask people nearby for the material. If less active, I would use the Internet (, and that's how use of Internet for research begins). Though, getting the material or service within the city is prioritized.
 
 <strong>Another example, if I want to do something, I'd ask people nearby if they want to do it, join, or, if it exists, join an event or group or space. In a less active mode, I wouldn't do it. It would remain a thought. Or, I'd have to do it alone.</strong> This is why a city works, for me. I just have to ask people nearby. <strong>The barrier of communicating an invitation is lowered, because they [people] are nearby. There is no need to create an event, make a big deal, plan a time, etc. One simply goes out, talks, and does things. It's natural.</strong>
 
 <strong>The distance between thought and action decreases as the [distance between humans](todo: link to post) decreases.</strong>
 
 <strong>Communication is an action. It increases as distance decreases.</strong> Dense-living peoples communicate orally. Sparse-living peoples communicate through mediums.
 
 Another example, if I want to call but don't have any charge for my phone's battery, during a more active time, I would simply ask people nearby if I can use their phone. During a less active time, I may search a place to charge my phone.
 
 <strong>Being active seems to include being more social, perhaps because social actions often can increase the speed of actions.</strong>
 
 I could feel the difference in state of minds when I slowed down. Before the city, I'd think about everything that made up a single shop, material, history, people in it, their minds, how the systems allowed the creation of it. A single shop was enough of an interest. A mind is interesting enough. It was worth talking to the people in it. But now in a city, I pass by so many. I can't talk to them all, make sense of them all; how they came to be, and so on. It's too much. Yet, it seems wrong to just pass by. <strong>Every shop has a life in it; How can one easily pass by so many shops?</strong> There is so much life to live by communicating with every shop. But why must I skip it? Why can't I spend my time here, in this geolocation, and communicate? Why move on? I just want to sit and talk.
 
 It just didn't make sense to move through a city. I don't even like moving, unless some vehicle is moving me, because it requires a piece of my brain, and that means less communicating.
 
 To walk through a campus like NTU or CHKU seemed impossible. Biking through, also a huge waste of time. The denser city was so much more efficient. There were people I could communicate to within such a short distance. Old schools are built like large government building areas, absolutely beuracratic and departmentalized. The city was infinitely more conducive to communication than the school. The school required others to transport with, or, use of digital communication.
 
 <strong>Only walkable human environments are ideal.</strong> In such places, the mind is freely able to communicate without being restricted by transportation and urban planning.
 
 If within a space a person receives a call and says "hold on, I'll call back once I'm in a quieter area", than that space fails to be communicable, and is dentrimental to the social well-being. <strong>To be well, one must maximize time within communicable spaces. Time spent outside those spaces is isolating.</strong>
 
 Digital communication alleviates spatial problems, tremendously. One can feel socially well in the worst environments as long as one has their digital communication application.

 There is an ideal of an idyllic, rustic lifestyle shared in many of my favorite animated films from Japan (<a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/wolf-children">Wolf Children Ame and Yuki</a>, <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/only-yesterday">Memories Drip-drop</a>, and <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/my-neighbor-totoro">My Neighbor Totoro</a> [todo: want to re-watch and review]. Perhaps resembling an actual arable area in Japan.
 
 [todo: haven't even started to write about this!]
 
 <h2>from thoughts</h2>
 9/9/2016
 To todo: pay bills!
 
 Continued thought for blog posts about the ideal lifestyle:
 
 Into the Forest of Firefly Lights harks memories, of childhood and the ideal of romance. It's simple, short, and sweet, much like the experience of watching many great short films (La Maison un Petites), but at 45 minutes, a bit more impact than those instant Pixar character development sequences through memory (Up).
 
 One thought provoked was whether this is based on an actual relationship. Of having problems in relationships due to time, loss, or even age difference. It seems in Japan (and much of Asia), there isn't much free-time, except during those childhood summers, when there's no school and the family takes a trip into the countryside. It's here freedom, love, imagination, sparks. And perhaps, there was a relationship during those summers. People do tend to work and forget about those important things: love and family. It's only when we have a break that we focus on it. All of my relationships have been during the summer too, because I focus on work (personal or wage labour) during the other seasons. I am normally focused on work. So, for me, it brings about some good romantic memories, time spent after summer school, time spent in the park. Innocent, romance.
 
 The second thought it provoked is of the ideal Japanese lifestyle as glorified by many of my favorite animated films.
 
 Though the film didn't depict it as the other films have (moving to the countryside [from an urban area], building a home, farming), somewhere in that childhood freedom in nature, there it still exists.
 
 During my time in Lanyu (蘭嶼), I wanted to experience and live in that culture: free-diving, fishing, spear-gun fishing, cooking, farming, vending, making things (commodities) from materials. It's primitive, especially when compared to my philosophic or new-media making past. It's natural science, as opposed to the infinitely more complex social philosophy. It's a material-oriented life, as opposed to an idea, information-oriented one (link to material vs information).
 
 It's what we experience as children: learning what materials do, making things out of them. Less care for social development. **Just taking everything in and acting upon it.
 
 Isn't that culture? To simply act within a time and space?**
 
 There, whilst experiencing 蘭嶼, memories of JRPGs such as Harvest Moon, MMORPGs such as Ragnarok Online, one mysterious one I can't remember the name of (link to forums of most recent RO game), World of Warcraft, and the infinite other RPGs I played when I was young came. I acted the same way as I did in those games: I went out alone, learned the environment, researched the best methods, and did things: practice swimming by snorkeling, catch crabs and cook and eat them (a rather haunting experience as they are so cute), catch fish via fishing and cook and eat them, research local flora and animals and make commodities out of them, sell things through vending on the street market.
 
 It's all quite the dream. It's all a game. **Each culture can be seen as a game.** People act according to their institutionalized cultured and habits: capitalism, passed-down behaviors, love, desire for social development, desire for wisdom. In the game of Lanyu, during the summer people capitalize through tourism (tour guides, snorkel and diving guides, accommodation, food vending), stocking money for the winter, or continue working by finding a job on Formosa (the main island of Taiwan). Catching and eating sea creatures is in their culture, from their past. The knowledge of the environment only known to those living there, and slowly disappearing due to social development of the children, and the lack of passing down of traditional ways of living from the elderly.
 
 It's all seemingly primitive compared to the Information Age, which involves tech-related occupations, computer programming; even the Industrial Age is very modern compared Lanyu. Sure there's manufactured rice now that is imported, and some tools from supermarkets from the town closest to the port, but not much is to be seen from the developed world.

 Quote from post-film thoughts of Into the Firefly Forest:
 > The film is slow, dreamy, like Totoro. It has its magic. It's predictable, yet I was happy to watch it, and it made me happy, optimistic.
 
 > For the simple things. Memories. Good times. Summers. Natural joy. Picnics. Talking. Sharing. Time.
 
 > I think of all those memories I created in Taiwan, and elsewhere. A happier place. Instead of my cultural theory, I take in the youthful joy. Of the Chinese class, of her, of my trip in Asia, of New York, of the fatkids, of College Park, of my youth. So many memories. It's beautiful to think about.
 
 > I've been so focused lately that I've recently stopped thinking. This free-thinking is what makes me happy. Ignore reality, and be happy.
 
 
 The literal name of the film of Only Yesterday is Omiede Poro Poro, (todo: check name) roughly memories trickling down, with poro poro being a sound-action of something dripping. Poro Poro! With the cute partially rolled r phonetic. And that's a core argument for living in Taiwan as opposed to New York (todo: link to post): that living in Taiwan creates more experiences, more memories. I've only lived in Taiwan for a small fraction of my life, yet as I think of my life, much of the memories were formed there. So many adventures, friendly people, thoughts. When I watch the memories of these films, my own memories of Taiwan, an island not dissimilar to Japan, are invoked. All those people, places, things I've done. When I stop, perhaps on a transportation, just as in the film (and many other films from Ghibli), the those memories rush back, or rather, they kind of trickle down, and I desire them.
 
 I want to go back, live them again. I contact the people. I tell them I am really cherished those times. It's s childish thing to do, yet, so human. During my recent heartbreak I took a ride a scooter from 宜蘭 through 台東 to 台南 and back toward 蘭嶼. Those memories came. I wrote to everyone I thought I may have loved during past time. I wrote it during the phase of break-up whee one seeks comfort. It was pathetic, yet affirming.
 
 I love Taiwan. I love the experiences I've had here. I love the people here.
 
 And so I desire to be here. I desire to join another hostel, be a part of the experiences that go in to living in one. I desire to live in Lanyu, farm and fish and vend. I desire to move to a farming area and build a home as was done in Wolf Children. But none can be done alone.
 
 And all of this contradicts my Western mind. My Western part desires to organize people on Lanyu to increase safety, health, and engineering. It desires a better education. Yet, it desires freedom, and enjoys the freedom the kids on Lanyu have. One feels a connection there. Those children are free, unlike Taiwan. They run around town, swim, hang out with strangers.
 
 Can both be had? Can one be rational and free? West and East?
 
 This contradiction is an everlasting conflict.
 -
 
 Why catch a single fish with rudimentary methods when there are huge high-tech boats with nets that catch hundreds? Why farm when there are huge farm fields looked over with industrial tractors and large machines? Why not just eat cheap cereals and skip to the information and ideas? One doesn't have to fight for survival in the Information Age. Cereals are cheap, air conditioning or even simple fans exist. Why go backward in social development? We should be designing and philosophizing.
 
 Why? Experience and memories. Nothing more.
 
 The West focuses on the material reality. Design. The East focuses on experiences. In the West, the portfolio matters most. In the East, you must provide a biography. It's not about what you make, it's what you have experienced. The experience of making is just a small part.
 -
 
 So what stops me from experiencing? My Western past. I often think in terms of social development. Increases the development of wisdom. Figuring out cities. Figuring out cultures. Social philosophy, urban planning, all of it.
 
 What's the point of creating yet another hostel? I should be pushing art with games for education, films with documentary and philosophical content, putting new knowledge into ever more accessible mediums. I should be in India de-slumming. I should be in an emergency care platoon. I should be doing a lot.
 
 Yet, I feel so stable, so normal, when I am on my own, doing my own things: fishing, making games, making things on my own. Not caring for the world's problems. It's taken me many years to get this feeling again. To forget about [ignore] politics is so difficult, when it affects everything.

 From <a href="https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20100112083031AA1feLj">Yahoo Answers</a>:
 <blockquote>幻 is more often used as a metaphor for things that are troubling you, ie. spectres from the past, things that are hard to grasp, etc. (ex. 幻の名物 - phantom souvenir - people say it is available, but you cannot find it) This is also often used when describing thinking about those who have died, especially those close to us, but less as a ghostbusters ghost and more as a ghost of the mind.</blockquote>
 
 <h2> notes from second viewing: </h2>
 
 Written the day after watching it, skimming through the video, like my old film-watching days:
 
 some thoughts while skimming, and re-occurred ones:
 
 There’s so few items in the household. Because the setting is in a past time, and because of Japanese culture.
 
 Her mind is stuck on the past. It’s too difficult to think about raising a child, …[stopped thought?]
 
 She’s beautiful. A bit alien, but stunning. Mongolian? Some Japanese aboriginal? Eyebrows and eyes are almost exaggerated.
 
 After the news of her husbands suicide, she bikes, ruminating. I do the same.
 
 At a later time, she dwells on past photos. I do the same.
 
 Strange match-making service. Quite similar to Indians. Is having a partner that important? Or is it merely cultural? I can imagine an American getting on fine without a partner, but I’d guess an Asian would rather *want* to share the experience.
 
 Japan’s geography is much like Taiwan. The coast is similar to the coast I’m currently near, on the southern tip of Taiwan, with a coral coast; quiet, small towns.
 
 Every detail and action matters in the film. It’s dense in content without action.
 
 The new husband’s house also frightens me of Japanese culture. An isolated room with a television. There’s just not enough noise, fun, action, social life. Everything is organized, thought and then decided upon. Very little consumption. Creating a very insular culture.
 
 She’s still able to smile and laugh. Amazing.
 
 The nature is stunning, like Taiwan.
 
 Super traditional formal wedding. Looks as if it could have happened in Taiwan too. The house, especially kitchen, feels warm, when there are people in it.
 
 The kids run around in nature. Lovely. Kids need it. Strange, but beautiful green tunnel door frame with the kids.
 
 Kids are picked up by a neighbor. Small town love.
 
 Traditional cutting and crafting. So slow, the life there is. People fish. Mothers cut their kid’s hair. All of this exists in Taiwan too. It’s strange, compared to modern societies. Does she have to adapt from Osaka? Was her job busy?
 
 Ah right, the tradition of leaving the house and coming in, as the daughter leaves for school. So much emphasis on the household.
 
 Hahaha the son is great, sleeping with the grandfather on the boat. The childhood love for nature is awesome.
 
 Such a slow life.
 
 She’s stunning without clothes too, even with an old-fashioned huge panty.
 
 The kids get along well. Like the Asian emphasis of having a partner to share an experience, it’s probably equally important to let the kids have a partner, a brother or sister, too.
 
 Hah Osaka looks terrible compared to the more natural coast, but as long as one spends much of the time in a house, it doesn’t matter where one lives.
 
 A bit of thrill: he comes all the way to the cafe near home, cheerfully, then intends to go home.
 
 Another strange slow, close-up frame, this time on her. Perhaps a cinematic cue, as it was with the boyfriend: a change in direction for the person.
 
 Man, learning radishes at the outdoor sink is a beautiful thing. So it putting up a bamboo fence. Only get this kind of life in the rural areas of Taiwan, like preparing for a typhoon and cleaning potato leaves.
 
 Is it possible to move on, after losing a long-loved one, such that of a childhood sweetheart? The new husband was able, but she isn’t. How can one replace 20 years of knowing someone? That’s non-sense. She’s right. It’s impossible.
 
 An alien cultural funeral procession? How the heck did Koreeda capture the beginning of snow with that frame?
 
 She continues to ruminate.
 
 His answer is great, about chasing an alluring light in the distance. There’s no real answer.
 
 The new husband is great, spending time with the kid, helping the son ride his bike.
 
 It’s during the winter humans ruminate, and during the spring and summer that humans take action. She decided to leave.
 
 obvious screenplay bits:
 new husband as a shadow
 she says “you nut” to her new husband, which was something her husband said to her
 her grandmother disappear into the cold and dies, the new grandmother figure disappears but comes back
 like her, the new husband senses something wrong, but perhaps feels it’s small
 son wants to buy a green bicycle with a bell like his father had
 Ozu ending
 - season change
 - position of her a little behind
 [probably missed a bunch, such as cleaning the floors, empty rooms, and more]
 —
 
 When I saw this during my film-consuming younger years, I thought it was great. Maybe it was the lack of words, emphasis on visuals, human gesture, and ideas.
 
 During this second view, after recovering from a personal recent heart-break, I just watch it without much feeling, in wonder, thinking of my own problems, or nothing, passing time. Perhaps it’s my favored contemplative pacing that made me love it.
 
 It is strange when the camera sits on her husband, in the factory, then again, when he leaves without looking back. His reaction is strange: he doesn’t react. She says she’s been acting a bit weird and he gives a strange story of an older retired sumo-wrestler co-worker making him depressed. Did he not react out of depression? She tries to cheer him up, with such pure-hearted cheerfulness, but to no avail.
 
 In a realistic analysis now: I know East Asian cultures tend to put blame on themselves, thus resulting in suicide, as opposed to Americans, who may find optimism in other motives (art, work, media), move on more easily (more shallow relationships), blame it on others, or some other method of coping.
 
 Indeed, Japan’s culture seems to be on the extreme end of the family-community spectrum. There is so much emphasis on family. So much so that memories, mementos, time, seem to create a whole different mindset [todo: perhaps add Our Little Sister thoughts here too]. Every object in a house has a reason or meaning. Any change in the family relationship is considered a paradigm shift. Every family decision is thought about deeply, decided formally. This is what frightens me about Japanese culture, because I’m on other extreme end — community and playing / exploration.

 <h2>during-film thoughts</h2>
 
 Suburban house, missing the in-between in life
 Noisy insects!
 --
 ...ended up just watching the entire thing as I did as when I was young.
 
 <h2>post-film thoughts</h2>
 
 A similar story to Spirited Away. Perhaps they root from some ancient Japanese source story.
 
 The film is slow, dreamy, like Totoro. It has its magic. It's predictable, yet I was happy to watch it, and it made me happy, optimistic.
 
 For the simple things. Memories. Good times. Summers. Natural joy. Picnics. Talking. Sharing. Time.
 
 I think of all those memories I created in Taiwan, and elsewhere. A happier place. Instead of my cultural theory, I take in the youthful joy. Of the Chinese class, of her, of my trip in Asia, of New York, of the fatkids, of College Park, of my youth. So many memories. It's beautiful to think about.
 
 I've been so focused lately that I've recently stopped thinking. This free-thinking is what makes me happy. Ignore reality, and be happy.
 - Perhaps not ignore reality, rather, stop organizational behaviors and live! 7784 2016-09-07 08:08:00 2016-09-07 12:08:00 open closed into-the-forest-of-fireflies-light publish 0 0 post 0 Art Film Reviews Films Humanities Life Personal medium_post O:11:"Medium_Post":11:{s:16:"author_image_url";s:74:"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/200/200/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png";s:10:"author_url";s:28:"https://medium.com/@rahil627";s:11:"byline_name";N;s:12:"byline_email";N;s:10:"cross_link";s:2:"no";s:2:"id";s:12:"d0a0502a6b38";s:21:"follower_notification";s:3:"yes";s:7:"license";s:19:"all-rights-reserved";s:14:"publication_id";s:12:"7a04709b0155";s:6:"status";s:6:"public";s:3:"url";s:141:"https://medium.com/@rahil627/%E8%9B%8D%E7%81%AB%E3%81%AE%E6%9D%9C%E3%81%B8-hotarubi-no-mori-e-into-the-forest-of-fireflies-light-d0a0502a6b38";} _edit_last 1 _yoast_wpseo_content_score 90 _yoast_wpseo_primary_category 11 歸途列車 (Last Train Home) http://rahilpatel.com/blog/%e6%ad%b8%e9%80%94%e5%88%97%e8%bb%8a-last-train-home Wed, 07 Sep 2016 12:20:47 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=7787 Just a few minutes into Last Train Home and my my wakes up from the sloth-paced recent days of healing and waiting for my money to come in.
 
 It's starkly different from watching a film by Koreeda, which is so familial, revolving about love. This film already incorporates space, governance, politics, culture, and so on. It has the bigger picture in mind. Koreeda focuses on house, this film focuses on the rest of the day, including work.
 
 Perhaps it's the hectic pace, of cities, of work. Once the scene of the countryside comes, I feel at ease again.
 
 Watching them get on the train is normal to me now. All of it is. I don't feel terrible about it? Become complacent? Lost my ideals?
 
 They travel 2100 kilometers, but don't experience any of it in between.
 
 <blockquote>You should avoid anything that should harm your study.</blockquote>
 
 The huge panaromas and distant views of the countryside and city really do contrast. Why go to such an ugly city? Why not live in that beautiful rural area? As long as one has access to a library, a computer, it's okay! Fuck the city. Especially a Chinese one.
 
 Part 2:
 Work is work. The factory looks like my first job's office. Not so bad. At least it has more people, and kids!
 
 Oh, but this times its a child worker. Damn.
 
 <blockquote>自由是快樂。</blockquote>
 
 Oh shit. That is her!
 
 Hmm, school or work, it's a prison, enclosed by culture. Cultures don't understand idleness.
 
 That's the Asian mentality: I'd rather work harder than for my child to work.
 
 Buying freedom, independence through work (in capitalism). Using time to buy time.
 
 <blockquote>Let's just roam around the world.</blockquote>
 
 Money vs being there. Being there, absolutely.
 ...
 
 Just watching the film now. Not much philosophizing, thinking. The daughter goes home for New Years with a spunky teenage attitude. Loves her grandparents more then her parents. Her little brother places a seemingly mere #5 in whatever school that is. The educators are probably very outdated, but it's not shown. Freedom through work, the American dream, is looked down upon.
 
 Watching the film, I don't feel much. I don't feel my need to change the world as I normally desire, when I am active. Acceptance? Lazy.
 
 Though, I don't feel so bad for the people either. Culture is the problem, largely. It's culture that forces people to smoosh into trains for New Years. It's culture that the parents want their kids to be educated through the traditional educational system. The daughter is the light. Yet, working that many hours doesn't get anyone anywhere, does it? Maybe the daughter will try a different job. It's just trial, part-time. Then move on just as she said the farm was a sad place, so too will the factor be. That's education. She's moving from the farm, to factory, to some place better. A hostel, hopefully!

 Back to 7-11 where there's air conditioner! Wow, what a difference! I can think. In not constantly in need of hydration. No mosquitos! The developed world in one room!
 
 Skipping straight in to the climax. Classic. Parent cares for money to raise child and support for education, child cares for none of it, and in a way, is right: she cares for the people near to her: her grandparents. What's money got to do with anything, including and especially education? That single decision is already smarter than her parents toiling away at non-sense. Perhaps it's up to her to save her parents from habituated misery. The father's seemingly rational view fails completely amidst the daughter's feelings
 
 The daughter working at a bar is not a bad first job. It's money. She's doing it right, experiencing slowly, reality. School doesn't teach it.

 Work can be categorized into those categories: creativity, what society wants, and what society needs.
 
 Let's take my recent experience in Lanyu (蘭嶼) as an example.
 
 Whilst living there, I had a billion of things I wanted to do. I wanted to forage local plants to make herbal drinks and vend them on the street. I wanted to research into nature-identifying mobile applications. I wanted to use local bamboo to make fishing rods for the kids to use, and tourists to rent. I wanted to use local taro leaves to make Totoro umbrellas for free local use, and for tourists to buy or rent. I wanted to fly fish with a minimal amount of gear. I wanted to have a semi-permanent camping spot for noamad-like tourists to come and experience Lanyu for free, only paying for experiences that require much information (local experiences such as catching and eating crabs and oysters, fishing, and snorkeling in the best spots), cooking catch-of-the-day. I wanted to use Taiwan crowdsourcing website to fund safety helmets for every scooter-owner. I wanted to conduct natural science endeavors -- exploring the area and organizing it into information. I wanted to create a DIY repair street stand, for home and gear repairs (fishing gear, swimming gear, farming gear). That's what I wanted. I created those ideas.
 
 What Lanyu needs is probably a good healthcare system, home water filtration systems, and a good political entity to defend against the authority of Taiwan, a public health system, to help those being domestically abused, and a social welfare system, to take care of the stray homeless, ultra-poor, and elderly.
 
 What Lanyu wants is probably more beer. More kinds of beer. More kinds of food. More stuff. English teachers. Better teachers. Better gear. And just to preserve its culture.
 
 To live entirely by creating is the lifestyle of a pure artist, usually titled hippies / gypsies. It's possible, but it's rough, depending on people around at that moment in time, as opposed to money, to get by. Though, you get absolute freedom, and do as you wish, it's usually hindered in time by the need of constantly seeking food and shelter. It takes some time to get better at this lifestyle. To learn to camp, use a water filter, avoid bad weather. Hippies usually acquire some skill to make money: crafting a commodity, or a service like teaching an art (play an instrument, sing, dance), teaching languages. My arts are game-making and philosophy. Neither of which are popular arts for any market.
 
 The desire for crowdsourcing helmets overlaps with what society needs. If the hostel idea extends to accommodate space for children or homeless people, then it also overlaps with what society needs.
 
 The desire for making herbal drinks and cooking freshly caught seafood, bamboo fishing rods, taro leaf umbrellas, and creating an experiential hostel overlaps with what society wants. People want new food and drinks. Kids want fishing rods. People want to experience another lifestyle / culture.
 
 None of these are jobs under some employer. There are no jobs on the island. But many of these ideas can obtain wealth through the exchange of services and/or goods for currency, perhaps entitling it to an independent business.
 
 A common insult to a hippie's lifestyle is that it's selfish, because it doesn't fit a need or want for society. Wants are not needed, so all want-jobs do not count toward benefitting society. What do societies actually need? A healthcare system. A few technological goods (computers, electrical fans -- taking care as they destroy culture). Good families. Good public spaces. <strong>A good culture</strong>. Goods and good, I guess.
 
 And hippies are good people who emanate <strong>good vibes</strong> to all those around them, but receive no monetary return. They usually get stuck working in an experiential, social place, like a hostel, children's museum, progressive children's schools, homely restaurants, DIY spaces, experimental venues, rural areas, domestic work (babysitting), where they are free to communicate and do as they wish (creating / arting). It's the experience that matters, and through sharing the experience, educates those around them.
 
 Capitalism doesn't favor hippies. Nor do many societies. They wander and find their little places in the world, until society forces them out, forcing them to repeat the process. Thus is the nomad's life.

 This may have been on my mind after reading much of <a href="https://hitchtheworld.com/">Patrick's blog</a>, a magnificent hippie, and then reading comments on <a href="http://imgur.com/gallery/CnT2W">a comic tribute to Patrick on imgur</a>, perhaps the most cancerous, insular online community I've ever encountered. Perhaps this is kind of my defense for Patrick's lifestyle, and in turn, my own.
 
 His lifestyle seems alien to most of the world, including his closest relatives, the indigenous Amazonian people, the Yanomami. In <a href="http://www.thebrokebackpacker.com/backpacker-interviews-hitch-world/#comment-5017">a comment by his father</a>, he says "There are enough doctors and lawyers in the world, and a few adventurers keep us all interested. We can live vicariously through their lives if we don’t have the heart or maybe a pair of lower organs to do what they are doing." And especially in the case of developed countries, that's the truth. There are so many professionals, that demand decreases and competition increases. They need to move from developed to less developed. Or, people need to find another way to live, to create -- oh those pitiful, boring souls!
 --
 
 During my time in Lanyu (and even in Taiwan), one does get that feeling though: what I am doing is useless, in the context of all societies, or in the progression of social development. Why fish (with a rod or spear-gun), when one can obtain industrially-created dry foods from the market, or even industrially-created fish (through aquaculture or large fishing vessels)? Should I be working in a job under one of those industries instead?
 
 Similarly, why farm, when that is industrialized too (unless taro plants cannot be automated for some reason)? Why make a rather inefficient canoe out of a single tree trunk when better-designed canoes are industrially constructed? Why gather and make herbal concoctions when huge pharmaceutical companies exist? Why sell commodities locally, when it could be sold online through an online marketplace? Why sell commodities when information or patents is what sells? Why do what other have already done? Why not venture anew, creating new media, new art.
 
 Why?
 
 Culture?
 
 <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znIXyFh6dsI&t=2m59s">And the answer comes</a>: experience. It's all a new experience to me. Perhaps people have experienced, but I haven't. The experiences can effect me. It alters me. I let it. It's life.
 
 And as it turns out, I loved doing all of those things.

 This also may have continued to linger on my mind, as while I'm stuck in place without money, I was thinking about what I would do if I were to go back home to VA, and one of those things were to get some more training, of course!; That's what developed countries are for. My interest was doing disaster relief better (and just being an awesome local rescuer, wherever I may be; breaking the exclusivity of professionalism), as opposed to just drifting through various useless non-profits. This led me toward emergency medical technician (EMT -> paramedic), a wilderness variant of it (WEMT), critical care nursing, and, surprisingly, firefighter, whom apparently are all-around badass emergency rescuers.
 
 Doing good without money has its barriers, yet training usually requires money. EMT requires training for certifications, firefighter requires training at a fire academy, though, one can volunteer in one's own country's fire station or volunteer ambulance squads. Accelerated bachelor nurse programs require a year or more of (expensive and boring) school. Paramedics require one to two years of training, in addition to EMT.
 
 This daydream of an idea, which extended to research, kind of makes me cringe, as my mind organizes toward something, something that would tie me down to a certain location for a certain period of time, as opposed to thinking freely and broadly, of all the possible things one can do and lifestyles one can live, whilst riding a scooter around Taiwan. 7799 2016-09-29 00:08:57 2016-09-29 04:08:57 open closed creativity-what-society-needs-and-what-society-wants publish 0 0 post 0 Action Determinism and Free Will Experience Humanities Metaphysics Mind and Matter Philosophy Physicalism and Materialism medium_post O:11:"Medium_Post":11:{s:16:"author_image_url";s:74:"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/200/200/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png";s:10:"author_url";s:28:"https://medium.com/@rahil627";s:11:"byline_name";N;s:12:"byline_email";N;s:10:"cross_link";s:2:"no";s:2:"id";s:12:"1cfecae2a768";s:21:"follower_notification";s:3:"yes";s:7:"license";s:19:"all-rights-reserved";s:14:"publication_id";s:12:"7a04709b0155";s:6:"status";s:6:"public";s:3:"url";s:84:"https://medium.com/@rahil627/creativity-vs-what-society-needs-and-wants-1cfecae2a768";} _edit_last 1 _yoast_wpseo_content_score 30 _yoast_wpseo_primary_category 187 _wp_old_slug creativity-vs-what-society-needs-and-wants Culture and [Social] Development http://rahilpatel.com/blog/culture-and-development Wed, 05 Oct 2016 08:34:28 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=7900 transcribed from an old sheet of paper:
 
 travel vs efficiency (medicine, engineer, etc.)
 travel vs system / organization (city, social organization)
 experience vs work
 - [perhaps I meant, following culture vs working toward social and / or material organization aka development]
 care for culture vs reality
 ->
 care for culture
 - mind
 - **social reality**
 - lack intelligence / belief, story
 - The Act of Killing, cultural problems
 - **no desire, apolitical, state**
 - yet happy
 - aboriginal singing
 - **non-capitalism**
 - culture / family [end / category]
 
 reality
 - education, resource, intelligence / skepticism, empiricism
 - fix problems, critical
 - **desire better, political, progress**
 - yet not happy
 - Kendrick Lamar
 - **capitalism?**
 - society / help all [end / category]
 
 
 from another sheet of paper:
 [todo: maybe to another post, toward survival-only work, do not care for culture / education, as to allow for all cultures to thrive]
 next sheet:
 Tainan day 1:
 *brainstorm*
 straight to Planett
 - thinking about south / east of Taiwan
 - development in Tainan vs development in *south / east*
 - SE being simpler, more creative, *leads to tools for survival*
 - can’t stop thinking about this, social relations with place, like tonghua, small towns, neighborhoods
 - gov, non-gov, community
 - kickstart vs find / join organization / just live there first?
 - or design?
 - vs independent art (myself)
 - only care for *survival* - engi (social, construction, software tools [personal, commercial, functional], etc.) / medicine (social health / healthcare)
 - gov vs non-gov?
 - *material infrastructure*
 x/- education / social?
 - can’t interrupt culture
 - i saw it. Their schools suck. Just give computer vs local culture.
 - *self-learning is best*

 notes:
 from a sheet of paper:
 live -> area problem -> *(low) work
 live -> *(high) art
 live -> love (place and people)
 
 daydreams:
 go around Taiwan with a group
 kickstart projects together
 find room
 move to next town
 continue
 [to ideal work]
 
 ideas:
 digital libraries
 - teach how to use e-reader, read. films. other arts.
 - in squatter spaces!
 - [vs public government buildings, such as libraries]
 - add sign, no cost
 - comfortable space as self-education
 - not education / social [? maybe meaning that the space is not social to the locality?]
 
 from another sheet of paper:
 50 days walk, 30km/day
 France to China
 no belongings / small backpack is enough
 - no tent if enough friends
 - [hmm. I don’t think this is possible. Need backpack with tent, like Patrick, then hitch.]
 no worry
 - need traveler friends, need to walk around Taiwan 7913 2016-10-05 05:26:16 2016-10-05 09:26:16 open closed the-ideal-way-to-experience publish 0 0 post 0 Life medium_post O:11:"Medium_Post":11:{s:16:"author_image_url";s:74:"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/200/200/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png";s:10:"author_url";s:28:"https://medium.com/@rahil627";s:11:"byline_name";N;s:12:"byline_email";N;s:10:"cross_link";s:2:"no";s:2:"id";s:12:"16372e4a3dad";s:21:"follower_notification";s:3:"yes";s:7:"license";s:19:"all-rights-reserved";s:14:"publication_id";s:12:"7a04709b0155";s:6:"status";s:6:"public";s:3:"url";s:69:"https://medium.com/@rahil627/the-ideal-way-to-experience-16372e4a3dad";} _yoast_wpseo_content_score 60 _edit_last 1 _yoast_wpseo_primary_category 141 Extending the Life of Super Smash Bros. Melee http://rahilpatel.com/blog/extending-the-life-of-super-smash-bros-melee Fri, 07 Oct 2016 17:33:42 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=7982 Sometime after watching some videos of Super Smash Bros. Melee (SSBM, Melee), I day-dreamed of a better version of Melee. There were more varied stages that fit the magical criteria of it being accepted by the community.
 
 Then I imagined a mew2king combo someone off-stage in jungle japes, ending in a spike into a klaptrap, which was somehow DI'd and tech-jumped, running into yet another spike into a second klaptrap.
 
 [I also imagined settings for turning on certain stage hazards, such as randall [the cloud], shy guys, and whispy, which all gives players a chance to interrupt combos or a chance at a recovery.]
 
 Anyway, it would all be simple if Nintendo made the game open-source. Yet, 16 years later, not even an ounce of support for the competitive scene. In it's stead, complete disregard and continued raking of capital through outdated proprietary hardware.
 
 Perhaps Japan's culture doesn't value competition as much as family fun, but, when it's as easy to do as pressing a button, the company's reputation, in my mind, continues to fall over time. If this were a reputable company, say, Blizzard, this opportunity would have been immediately capitalized (taken advantage of). I can't imagine any of the game programming to be special enough to be secret, so, I see no reason why not.
 
 With some tweaks here and there, perhaps most of the stages, characters, [, items? stage hazards?] could be playable, resulting in more life without adding complexity (more information).
 
 The result of ignoring and avoiding that decision has wasted much human labor through <a href="https://smashboards.com/threads/melee-hacks-and-you-new-hackers-start-here-in-the-op.247119/">attempts to hack it</a> and <a href="http://www.ssbwiki.com/Project_M">even using a sequel to the game to replicate it</a>. <strong>So much human effort often is wasted due to simple decisions by the privileged and/or property-owners.</strong>

Such a joyless society, where drinking beer in the park is one’s joy. Only relations, no other form of joy. No consumerism, I guess?
 - perhaps the lack of communication is the problem. No creativity, no talking.
 - at least, that’s my current problem and reason for depression
 
 woman holding on to relationship and job, far overdue, barely able to get up and “walk” on one’s own
 - unable to walk! That’s me currently, or after heartbreak, or after leaving a community, or basically my life in Taiwan. I’ve become so relationship-oriented that I’ve lost my childhood desires (not teacher fantasies).
 
 desire to do personal design / work / art, motivated working for capital at restaurant
 <blockquote>Surely I missed her, but…
 I think it’s clinging to those feelings that’s keeping me a little kid.
 
 27 years old, yet but [feels as if she] didn’t do anything during the past 12 years [(27–12=15)]
 I’ve always been here, stuck in the same place
 - hmmm, very possible. Those poor Tokyo souls; Minds trapped by the strength of culture, and relationships. How awful, being a slave to culture, unable to make decisions autonomously. I really shouldn’t hitch through Japan, should I?
 
 Didn’t do anything wrong (when another person falls in love)
 - Reminds me of some Koreeda film. Hmmmm, I think? Can’t think of it [now]…</blockquote>
 mmm, actually a good conversation of school / culture problem (referring to the teacher-student situation)
 - again, east Asian school culture have such close relationships that even teachers are able to get hurt.
 - A huge problem pointed out is that the police is useless. Saving face. Just earlier today, I was thinking about how a women would be unable to live my life as I’ve been sleeping outside next to a hot spring lately, because she risks getting raped. How fucking frightening is that? I checked the internet, noticed that the statistics were near 20% for America (WTF, my mind still hasn’t been able to digest this), and 1% in Japan. The problem is that Japanese people rarely report it, to save face, patriarchal society, etc. cultural problems of Japan. Wild. These far east societies really do retain some ancient cultural problems, and they take so long to change. Maybe another generation? It’s so strange to me for it to progress so slow in these social aspects. But if Japan is anything like Taiwan, perhaps it isn’t, as much of Taiwan is old, rural, backward-thinking in oh so many ways (education, healthcare, police, general etiquette, everyday work-life at companies).
 
 no beer sign. Also no playing sign?
 
 classic literature still seems to be taught in Japanese society, if I were to take these animated films as truth. Wolf Children had a philosophy class, Only Yesterday had a Basho poem, and this one includes a tanka, and the woman is a classic literature teacher. This is quite a contrast to American education of science. Of course, I prefer philosophy, as it creates good conversation and relates to life.
 
 ahhh, the joy of nature :) (as typhoon or heavy rain and wind comes in)
 - so many memories of this in Taiwan
 <blockquote>you saved me.
 - ahhh the classic post break-up need for human <strong>physical</strong> support to move on</blockquote>
 
 <h2>a post-thought:</h2>
 Aesthetically, I didn’t care much. It was even distracting at first, to see the camera zoom out and track, or take shots of random spots as if it were a real one, and having focus like expensive cameras, taking those cheesy transition shots that focus out. Poor souls who animated the thing, wasting time mimicking standard live films.
 
 I probably missed out on some classic Japanese ideas (symbolism) in all of those nature shots. Zen? Them being in a garden. Fengshui? Weather patterns? Anyway, I don’t feel it mattered too much. 7992 2016-09-08 02:20:54 2016-09-08 06:20:54 open closed the-garden-of-words publish 0 0 post 0 Art Film Reviews Films Humanities medium_post O:11:"Medium_Post":11:{s:16:"author_image_url";s:74:"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/200/200/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png";s:10:"author_url";s:28:"https://medium.com/@rahil627";s:11:"byline_name";N;s:12:"byline_email";N;s:10:"cross_link";s:2:"no";s:2:"id";s:10:"33867dc08a";s:21:"follower_notification";s:3:"yes";s:7:"license";s:19:"all-rights-reserved";s:14:"publication_id";s:12:"7a04709b0155";s:6:"status";s:6:"public";s:3:"url";s:105:"https://medium.com/@rahil627/%E8%A8%80%E3%81%AE%E8%91%89%E3%81%AE%E5%BA%AD-the-garden-of-words-33867dc08a";} _edit_last 1 _yoast_wpseo_content_score 30 _yoast_wpseo_primary_category 11 Reading Political History http://rahilpatel.com/blog/reading-political-history Sat, 28 May 2016 17:28:14 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=8052 [aka Criticism of the Experience of Reading Political Histories]
 
 Thoughts after [listening to] 25 minutes of <a href="https://archive.org/details/HadasMosesAHistoryOfRomeFromItsOriginsTo529A.D.AsToldByTheRomanHistorians">A History of Rome by Hadas Moses</a>:
 
 The format is wonderful: chronologically ordered narrative with huge quotes from ancient sources{, starting with Livy}. It reads like one huge story!
 
 But, is it worth reading such text? It’s so unreal, granted, it does start with the more legendary ancient stuff. Can <em>anything</em> be learned? I highlighted and noted so few bits, especially when compared to, say, <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/the-metropolis-and-mental-life">Georg Simmel</a>, or any biography: In a biography I can try to see why a person takes the actions that they did; In philosophy, I can match many of my own ideas to the philosopher’s, picking up some words, mapping some ideas together, or with better reading actually learn something or provoke thoughts. But <strong>reading a narrative (political) history seems as dull to the mind as reading a narrative fictional book: It feels as if there is no social reality to to try to understand actions; There are no ideas to better understand the world and people’s minds.</strong> <strong>The society is simply too distant.</strong> <strong>Perhaps reading about Romans war is similar to reading about New Guinean tribes war.</strong> <strong>The difference in the experiences of reading and watching a documentary is phenomenal.</strong> My mind works during the experience of watching. Things click, neurons are linked.
 
 I will continue, but I think, watching any sort of socially real film is a far better use of time.
 
 Perhaps reading social history is a better experience. 8052 2016-05-28 13:28:14 2016-05-28 17:28:14 open closed reading-political-history publish 0 0 post 0 Applied Philosophy Art Communication Experience Humanities Literature Media Philosophy Philosophy of History Philosophy of Literature medium_post O:11:"Medium_Post":11:{s:16:"author_image_url";s:74:"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/200/200/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png";s:10:"author_url";s:28:"https://medium.com/@rahil627";s:11:"byline_name";N;s:12:"byline_email";N;s:10:"cross_link";s:2:"no";s:2:"id";s:12:"f285feee8ccc";s:21:"follower_notification";s:3:"yes";s:7:"license";s:19:"all-rights-reserved";s:14:"publication_id";s:12:"7a04709b0155";s:6:"status";s:6:"public";s:3:"url";s:67:"https://medium.com/@rahil627/reading-political-history-f285feee8ccc";} _edit_last 1 _yoast_wpseo_content_score 30 _yoast_wpseo_primary_category 253 Book-shops and Learning http://rahilpatel.com/blog/book-shops-and-learning Sun, 26 Jun 2016 18:21:31 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=8064 [aka Re-visiting the Eslite Book-store]
 
 Back to <a href="https://www.google.com.tw/maps/place/%E8%AA%A0%E5%93%81%E6%95%A6%E5%8D%97%E5%BA%97+Eslite+Dunhua+Store/@25.0392167,121.5473889,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x3442abcfe9e7617d:0x496596e7748a5757!8m2!3d25.0392119!4d121.5495829">the place I began reading</a>, for a day, before I leave Taipei, and leave reading again.
 
 I now see why this book-store was so conducive before: the selection is amazing. A normal, rather large library in itself is of almost no organizational use. It’s good for the purpose of research, as it can provide written source sources, but that’s it. It doesn’t offer a general education in any way. It’s a mess of information, like the Internet, except more out-dated and disorganized (physical organization hits it’s limit compared to searchable digital organization). The book-store, though sufficiently large for any human, just provides a a few shelves for world history or Western philosophy. The selection top notch: top publishers, highly regarded, highly readable, organizations of knowledge: <em>A Little History of the World</em>, <em>Sapiens</em>, <em>What is Cultural History?</em>, <em>Social Class in the 21st Century</em> (Pelican) – that’s what I’ve got next to me at the moment.
 
 This kind of organization, a well-selected library is quite a different experience from Wikipedia too. <strong>Wikipedia doesn’t organize information in the way that people can.</strong> People can organize the same information into infinite ways and mediums. For Wikipedia, though not restricted, the format is quite standard. If I look at the history of the world article, it’s likely chronologically and spatially ordered somewhat, leading to separate histories of each country. The small topics chosen by Harari in <em>Sapiens</em> to describe the history of the world through ideas like science and empire of the industrial-research-technology complex just doesn’t fit Wikipedia’s format. <strong>The mapping of knowledge, the gaining of wisdom, seems entirely dependent on the way information is organized.</strong> That is, after all, what artists do: manipulate information (via material [non-digital and digital]).
 
 This better explains <a href="experience">my first experience with books here</a>. I found the Western Philosophy section and the readings must have organized my mind because the selection was so <em>damn good</em>. I [can only] imagine few people [in the world] that [may have] began reading with Bacon, Montaigne, Wittgenstein, Russell, in that order. Perhaps western philosophy initially lead me in the wrong directions; it being merely an intellectual history, but it was a start.
 
 Now, I feel I can peruse the entire library, though I still choose to stick to culture (cultural theory and maybe cultural history) and those finer gems: highly readable, uniquely organized writings. But I don’t feel there’s much use. <strong>[Written] Organization is for the weak. Its detail will always be lossy and of low-quality. It’s best to stay skeptic: all written history is false and all philosophy is bullshit. Now, with only a map, go out and consume and alter the world!</strong> 8064 2016-06-26 14:21:31 2016-06-26 18:21:31 open closed book-shops-and-learning publish 0 0 post 0 Applied Philosophy Art Communication Epistemology Experience Humanities Literature Media Philosophy Philosophy of Education Philosophy of Language Philosophy of Literature Uncategorized medium_post O:11:"Medium_Post":11:{s:16:"author_image_url";s:74:"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/200/200/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png";s:10:"author_url";s:28:"https://medium.com/@rahil627";s:11:"byline_name";N;s:12:"byline_email";N;s:10:"cross_link";s:2:"no";s:2:"id";s:12:"196ffd8f5542";s:21:"follower_notification";s:3:"yes";s:7:"license";s:19:"all-rights-reserved";s:14:"publication_id";s:12:"7a04709b0155";s:6:"status";s:6:"public";s:3:"url";s:64:"https://medium.com/@rahil627/bookshops-and-learning-196ffd8f5542";} _edit_last 1 _yoast_wpseo_content_score 30 _yoast_wpseo_primary_category 1 _wp_old_slug bookshops-and-learning Sense-Deprivation http://rahilpatel.com/blog/sense-deprivation Sat, 08 Oct 2016 05:47:59 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=7985 a note from perhaps yesterday, or the day before when I tried to watch Into the Forest of Fireflies Light in a rather sense-deprived room in a library:
 
 <blockquote>keep traveling, keep living, keep reality in view.
 too boring, seen already.</blockquote>
 
 [unnecessary content: And that’s the truth. There’s no desire of re-experiencing something I’ve recently experienced, except perhaps as some sort of further philosophical investigation.]
 
 I wanted to continue living. I wanted nature. I wanted the elements to affect me, the stimuli of reality, not information, not in a sense-deprived environment such as a room, office, school, or suburban house. People shouldn’t have to use media to make-up for the lack of stimuli, such as turning on foreign music or artificial ambient noise in a cafe-like space, or similarly comfortable environments. Let the environment be the stimulus, let reality be that environment, then route attention to whatever one desires. Do not go to a closed environment (ex. library, room in a house, etc.) to study, just live, outside, and take the book along, having the contents in one’s peripheral attention, and reality in one’s main attention.
 
 Furthermore, such senseless environments lead to depression. Without stimulus, the body desires comfort (in temperature, diet) and sleeps without desire to live because there is nothing to respond to. Or, it desires a stimulant, such as caffeine, to make up for the lack of stimuli.
 
 Even furthermore, the habit of going to, commuting to, or living in such an environment eventually [period of time varies on how much one was experiencing, {or has experienced in life?}] can create a very mis-represented vision (imagined) of reality.
 
 [Perhaps because memory and attention need to be constantly engrossed and focused on reality, not signs.]
 
 Thus, another argument for nomadism? [Or for the human need to experience {feel one is experiencing}?]

The page I read was okay. It had lengthy direct quotes from good writings. The creator of the site successfully linked ideas from several writings, usually philosophy-oriented. And it seems all well, using the hypertext system as it was meant to be, like a personal Wikipedia, much like my own philosophical blog, but with more highlights and bookmarks, yet, I never read another page of the website.
 
 Why? <strong>The ideas the creator finds are other people's ideas. She doesn't originate the ideas from her own personal experiences. She doesn't write about her own experiences, or how her readings relate to her life, or why she's reading at all. She only reads and connects ideas through hyperlinks.</strong> Though her taste in readings are good, meaning she has much wisdom (and therefore experience), unfortunately, it isn't enough. <strong>It's merely an amalgam of readings, like a bookshop with a good selection, or a <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/the-kinds-of-literature-and-the-extraction-of-ideas">reader book (a kind of anthology)</a>, and, like a bookstore owner, she's not creating content, she's just selecting it. The resulting feeling of it's entirety is equivalent to a well-selected bookshop or Goodreads account: an entirely non-personal experience.</strong>
 
 Furthermore, her content is limited to books. There are no pictures that she's taken, of reality, of her experiences, not even of taking a screenshot from Google Maps. In it's stead, there are only related pictures she found on the Internet, which again, is merely selecting information, and worse, make the content feel like a SEO-whore. There are no video clips. There are no other forms of art objects. It is entirely limited to the medium of writing, <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/prose-is-superfluous-active-communication-through-play-and-art">which is a very distorted form of communication</a>. And that's okay, as I don't put in the extra effort for other forms of communication on my blog either, but, unlike her, I'm not trying to share others' wisdom and ideas, I'm constantly making them. 7994 2016-10-08 03:32:47 2016-10-08 07:32:47 open closed a-thought-about-brain-pickings publish 0 0 post 0 Art Communication Humanities Media New Media New Media Design Philosophy medium_post O:11:"Medium_Post":11:{s:16:"author_image_url";s:74:"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/200/200/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png";s:10:"author_url";s:28:"https://medium.com/@rahil627";s:11:"byline_name";N;s:12:"byline_email";N;s:10:"cross_link";s:2:"no";s:2:"id";s:12:"66998d360659";s:21:"follower_notification";s:3:"yes";s:7:"license";s:19:"all-rights-reserved";s:14:"publication_id";s:12:"7a04709b0155";s:6:"status";s:6:"public";s:3:"url";s:69:"https://medium.com/@rahil627/a-thought-on-brain-pickings-66998d360659";} _edit_last 1 _yoast_wpseo_content_score 30 _yoast_wpseo_primary_category 207 _wp_old_slug a-thought-on-brain-pickings Film Lists, Watching Life, and Letting Beauty Emerge http://rahilpatel.com/blog/film-lists-watching-life-and-letting-beauty-emerge Mon, 10 Oct 2016 14:07:09 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=8005 <h2>talk talk talk</h2>
 One of my earliest posts on this blog, circa 2010, was <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/save-your-netflix-ratings">about saving Netflix ratings</a>. I still have that file. I found it in my Dropbox. And now, 6 years later, I used it.
 
 Netflix previously failed by narrowing their film selection to a small selection of popular films around the time that they created the digital streaming service. Netflix seems to have failed yet again by not giving a simple interface / display of user ratings, allowing the internet free-market to fill in the gap.
 
 Upon searching the internet for anime films to watch after being quite life-affirmed by Colorful [todo: add link later], I stumbled upon Letterboxd. I'm unsure why it took so long for such a simple website to form. Perhaps there was that generic list-making website before it?
 
 Anyway, here's <a href="https://letterboxd.com/rahil627/list/rahil627s-favorite-films/">a list of favorite films that I created</a> How bored / habituated to sedentary life I must currently be.
 
 Further, <a href="https://letterboxd.com/rahil627/likes/lists/">I *liked* a few lists</a>. I *liked* too many. Not good. I over-browsed, over-consumed, over-organized.
 
 But, <strong>if your aesthetic judgement finds bits of beauty in the infinitude of audio-video output, then, through the linking of those bits one eventually finds a beauty bit collector! </strong> ScorpioRising might be one, as his list <a href="https://mubi.com/users/114842/lists">As I Was Browsing The Auteurs, Occasionally I Saw Glimpses Of Beauty</a> (also copied to letterboxd by another user) seems to be a collection of beautiful bits. Undoubtedly, <strong>beauty (including love) naturally unfolds in those films.</strong> And surely, there are more lists out there like it, such as assasf's list <a href="https://letterboxd.com/affasf/list/filmlist:392365/">(((</a>.
 
 I think that's all I need now as far as film selection goes for the next few years. Gone are those early college days of perusing Metacritic, Roger Ebert's website, BFI's Sight & Sound, big three festival-winners and their specific awards, and other critic-oriented lists which result in similar film canons (though <a href="https://letterboxd.com/kenji1/list/kenjis-canon/">Kenji's canon</a> is probably darn good), sloppily adding them to a 500 capacity ordered queue on Netflix, or post-Netflix, a text file. Finding Letterboxd reminds me of my experience with 8tracks, where <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/tools-for-organizing">people discover music and create music playlists</a> as opposed to machines or in film lists: critics, and I was able to freely enter countries and listen to the sounds of that country, without a need to really select what to listen to, spending more time experiencing, less time searching. <strong>Now I feel I can continue living life, watching reality at the pace of reality, as I did when I rode my bike when I was a child, and still now, when I ride my scooter. Just watching, nothing in particular, allowing one's attention to see the natural beauty of the world.</strong>
 
 So, <strong>if my habits become more sedentary, focusing on information (digital or not; mediated communication) rather than reality, as many modern jobs force one to do for several hours per day, and as desired information is easy to obtain, then these films can save me, alter my habits and attention from the mirror of the world that is information to the real world, remind me what life is like in different areas on earth, inspire me, to go out, and live, again.</strong>
 
 <h2>Further talking</h2>
 Kenji's austere film list is on three websites: <a href="http://www.listal.com/list/austere-films">Listal</a>, <a href="https://mubi.com/lists/an-austere-list">MUBI</a>, and <a href="https://letterboxd.com/kenji1/list/an-austere-list/">Letterboxd</a>, and in that order in Google popularity. Hmmmmm.
 
 It also seems Letterboxd has a database of films, so many films are missing. Can't just write the title in?
 
 <h2>More lists</h2>
 While searching for slow-spaced, contemplative goodness, I stumbled upon <a href="https://letterboxd.com/kenji1/list/an-austere-list/">An Austere List</a> by Kenji. I'm a bit frightened to watch that right now, as only having watched The White Ribbon from that list. But, luckily, I found <a href="https://letterboxd.com/iain_s/list/slow-cinema-filmography-1975-2013/">Slow Cinema Filmography (1975-2013)</a>, which derive's its list from a thesis. Awesome!
 
 Kenji has a <a href="https://letterboxd.com/kenji1/list/favourite-indian-films/"> list for Indian films</a>! So, maybe, there's more than Satyajit Ray.
 
 <a href="https://letterboxd.com/wu_yong/list/anthropology-and-empathy/">Anthropology and empathy</a> reminds me that one can just search for research topics, such as human condition, urban planning, cultural theory, or <a href="https://mubi.com/lists/hatred-of-capitalism">hatred of capitalism</a>. 8005 2016-10-10 10:07:09 2016-10-10 14:07:09 open closed film-lists-watching-life-and-letting-beauty-emerge publish 0 0 post 0 Art Film Reviews Films Humanities Life Personal Philosophy of Film medium_post O:11:"Medium_Post":11:{s:16:"author_image_url";s:74:"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/200/200/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png";s:10:"author_url";s:28:"https://medium.com/@rahil627";s:11:"byline_name";N;s:12:"byline_email";N;s:10:"cross_link";s:2:"no";s:2:"id";s:11:"a12229e9f90";s:21:"follower_notification";s:3:"yes";s:7:"license";s:19:"all-rights-reserved";s:14:"publication_id";s:12:"7a04709b0155";s:6:"status";s:6:"public";s:3:"url";s:91:"https://medium.com/@rahil627/film-lists-watching-life-and-letting-beauty-emerge-a12229e9f90";} _edit_last 1 _yoast_wpseo_content_score 30 _yoast_wpseo_primary_category 113 Japan http://rahilpatel.com/blog/japan Wed, 30 Nov 2016 14:12:30 +0000 admin http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/?p=8034 [exported from a markdown text file]

 <h2>Fuck Japan</h2>
 
 <p>Fuck Japan.</p>
 
 <p>That&#8217;s all I got.</p>
 
 <p>Fuck Japan.</p>
 
 <p>Perhaps the reason I never thought to talk to others when I lived in suburban America, anyone nearby, as I did during much of my 20s [and perhaps childhood], is because I simply wasn&#8217;t interested in the others. Japan [Japanese culture] has altered my behavior to not be interested in other people. As I [just earlier] peered through the express train&#8217;s window as it was rushing me toward the airport, perhaps the first time I&#8217;ve taken an express transport whilst having time, I didn&#8217;t care what is inside those buildings, those giant apartment complexes, the curtained shops, or traditionally-achitected homes.</p>
 
 <p>Fuck &#8217;em.</p>
 
 <h2>And here&#8217;s why</h2>
 
 <p>And here&#8217;s why:</p>
 
 <p>Japanese culture has these characteristics: exclusive, unwelcoming, stingy (mentality, monetarily, and urban design), unhospitable (no hospitality), extremely organized (/obessissively), cold (temperature and feeling), robotic (rule-based automoton behavior), unwilling and no desire to learn (beyond what was learned to survive in an individuals tiny social unit), ie (家, socially seperated into tiny social units, nepotism), instrumentally reasoned toward survival and comfort, and overall, inhospitable (uninhabitable)&#8230; [todo: add more charactersitics]</p>
 
 <p>Much of it overlaps with (rich?) suburbia. The simple, I&#8217;m surviving (living), why do / learn anything else? Why care about what other people / cultures / minds think? It&#8217;s a classic social problem: closing of the mind, habituation.</p>

 <p>When a society develops, it develops materially too. It industrializes, organizes, constricting creativity and freedom. It organizes what you eat (taste), see, feel, and do. Japan has narrow taste in all aspects: food, design, fashion, textures, images, and so on. When one doesn&#8217;t fit what the local culture has organized the material to, then one has to go back, to raw materials, and create it, from scratch. Cook, design anew, make. I almosted needed to, to survive it. Perhaps that&#8217;s how cultural neighborhoods form in cities: a desire to make the material world according to one&#8217;s own taste shaped by past cultures.</p>
 
 <p>/</p>
 
 <p>One may wander, how such a narrow-minded society became rich? Robots are good at making (barely creative) products, and that&#8217;s a much wanted commidity for most of the world. Well-made cars, house appliances, farming equipment. Automate work needed for survival, automate the process to make the machines, then sell it. That&#8217;s the limit of Japan&#8217;s intelligence. It never quite gets to actually creating information, ideas, new ways to live, new ways to help others. The ultimate Japanese society is the present one: it already reached it&#8217;s end.</p>
 
 <p>The small social unit idea works (is successful) for the same reason a specialized machine works: it is a machine, it was made to work.</p>
 
 <p>/</p>
 
 <p>A thought from earlier today:
 Japanese people are not good at playing games; Games play them. They are good at abiding rules (being obedient), but not playing (in any sort of creative sense). They work within rulesets, similar to their small social units / knowledge / life. They can &#8220;play&#8221; a calculative arcade music rhythym or card or fighting &#8220;game&#8221;, but they will fail in any one that rewards creativity.</p>
 
 <p>An older recurring thought:
 Japanese society is exactly the one depicted in Wall-E. It really is that dystopian. People aren&#8217;t fat, but people do go from one place to another while watching a screen in their box cars, eat CalorieMate (a &#8220;nutritious&#8221; block of food), and consume addictive substances without the bad stuff (Coke zero, Strong zero, cigarettes with devices that remove the smell<a href="#">?</a>, etc.).</p>
 
 <h2>notes from papers and text files written during the trip</h2>
 
 <p>ordered from past to present:</p>
 
 <h3>1</h3>
 
 <p>the Fablab charter is similar to my own: of <strong>allowing the public access to tools to enable people to make [almost] anything</strong>,&#8211; <strong>but making is such a small part [subset] of doing (performing, teaching, work, etc.).</strong>
 .
 at the lab I realize the reasons I made or did anything [in the past] was for poltiical [/personal] reasons: I wanted to alter the behavior of people {not true, there were many motives: bring awareness to society, or simply just to spend time with people whilst being productive &#8211; whatever productive may be in my mind during a time and place} . Making a sign {for the no vehicles in market areas idea} was just a small part of a solution to do so. That&#8217;s all it ever is {That&#8217;s all fablabs are able to do}. It&#8217;s not an end. It&#8217;s just an enabler for making stuff {, materially}.
 .
 Outside the lab {Fablab Dazaifu}, there is one large panchinko parlor and duplicate apartment complexes. Such a boring place! Only the lab is homey. Perhaps all indoor spaces are homey. But the problem is that most are <em>exclusive</em>.
 .
 I should try to make something at each space, but, as I said, I need a political / personal motivation.
 - {I felt that being at a space would be no use without a reason / motive. <strong>A desire to do something for society is needed, then one goes to a space to work something out,</strong> but I had zero care for Japan&#8217;s society.}
 .
 [todo: to blog]
 $<strong>Fab labs, like hotels contain great people</strong>, like [censored name]. <strong>People at service for others, for the community.</strong>
 .
 <strong>But the problem of fab labs, or most spaces, like departments at a school, is that they are narrow</strong>
 - {mmm, thus, every space is too narrow, not enough diversity (of minds). That seems to be a recurring problem of mine. Whatever space I go to, it is a gathering of similar interests, as opposed to a set of random people. What kind of space has that?: A household? Shared living? Co-living spaces.
 in ideology / culture / mind - they tend to make the same things (was thinking of things same things all fab labs make). The goal is to invite others to participate. It&#8217;s a good start. It&#8217;s still an open, public space, <strong>like a public garage</strong>.
 - {hmm, that really is all it is. Make a garage public. Host events at home. Isn&#8217;t that how the internet was created?}
 .
 Still, <em>I can&#8217;t live here</em> - I am not motivated / living in Japan&#8217;s society.** I need a society that I love in order to make stuff for it** (Jiufen&#8217;s Spirited Away idea, urban interventions, etc.).
 - {love reciprocation idea [todo: etch this out later]}
 .
 [todo: to blog]
 In Japan, people do the work, <strong>they do what&#8217;s needed to survive the longest [and to maximize comfort]</strong>; <strong>In Taiwan, people care for the ideas, talk about it</strong>, but not worry much about the age they will die {, or doing things &#8211; implementing ideas.}
 .
 [todo: to blog]
 $In Japan, <strong>people [<em>only</em>] care for their culture</strong>, only focus on their own narrow culture&#8217;s desires; In Taiwan, they&#8217;re open to other cultures and ideas - for aboriginals and foreign cultures - , thus they develop more unevenly, but accordingly for / to each culture - thus it is free, open.</p>
 
 <p>Japan is singular. There is only Japanese culture; Everything else is &#8220;other&#8221;, rejected.</p>
 
 <p>Laws exist. Social pressures are strong. It is difficult, unlawful, unfaithful, un-family-like to go against the grain.</p>
 
 <p><strong>Taiwan doesn&#8217;t care much for culture, other than langauge and ideas</strong> (including knowing their own social history). Thus, <strong>Taiwan is more ideal, but in reality may not seem so; Japan seems ideal, especially statistically, but in reality is dystopian.</strong>
 - {It&#8217;s as if Japan designed their society and actually abide the design. There is no human element, no natural feelings to disrupt it.}
 .
 but <strong>comfort and long survival come at a cost of material commodities</strong>. Japan accumulates capital to build the most comfortable, convenient place. Taiwan does not care much for comfort - they care for just living on by doing whatever they&#8217;ve become habituated to do - craft, cook, all is okay to live such a lifestyle, even if it does not improve survival or comfort.
 - {The cost of material commodities being human labor and the destruction of nature; It&#8217;s the difference between living in a shed in Taiwan and a fully-equiped apartment in a high rise in Japan.}
 - {Though Taiwan doesn&#8217;t care much for comfort of the body, they&#8217;ve somehow created the most comforting, hospitable culture.}</p>
 
 <h3>2, 11/3/16</h3>
 
 <p>Japan is super-developed. <strong>Almost no nature</strong> {to be found}. Farms, well-planned, land intensely used. <strong>The world has been dominated.</strong> They win. Really get that Takahata theme felt. It seems (appears) that the mountains may sitill have natural areas {Maybe. Or maybe those trees were planted too.}. The farming villages next to mountains are beautiful {in a rustic aesthetic sense}, but <strong>completely planned out like Sim City. Capital is planned for. Efficient capital and work. No life. No experience.</strong></p>
 
 <p>Japan, well, Kyushu&#8217;s largest festival (Karatse Kunchi [Nagasaki Kunchi too?]) provides the only lively feeling in Japan. Steets closed, kids wander large areas and play. A ton of vendors sell food at stalls. Expensive now, but a glimpse of the past, less developed times &#8211; a diferent lifestyle, similar to present Taiwan, or other Southeast Asian markets. {Teenagers and men alike get drunk, equally unable to hold their liquor; A glimpse of the repressed hedonism.}</p>
 
 <p>[todo: worded / recalled differently - X]
 Japan&#8217;s society is ordered like ants; Taiwan&#8217;s allows freedom? Taiwanese people appear to be hippies compared to Japanese people!</p>
 
 <p><strong>Japan planned their economy and followed it obediently.</strong> | <strong>It worked for commodities (products) for the moment (period of time) in the past, but now, they lack the creativity to excel, which only exists with good, diverse, dense places <em>and</em> a culture that interacts and plays.</strong></p>
 
 <p><strong>Japanese peoples&#8217; bodies move robotically,</strong> following straight-forward structure and routine, but what about their minds? <strong>They act according to material &#8211; capital-rational</strong>, but <strong>their minds escape through childish images</strong> of characters, manga, anime, and digital worlds. <strong>It&#8217;s a utopia for the body</strong> &#8211; isn&#8217;t that the ideal? Keep the bodies comfortable, through convenience!; But minds keep working, don&#8217;t they? <strong>They act culturally-economically {group consensus or for capital), not making decisions creatively</strong>, or finding different ways to live, rather, following old ideas, and making them a concrete reality.</p>
 
 <p><strong>Taiwan communicates well, but Japan works well &#8211; obediently, robotically.</strong></p>
 
 <p><strong>Japan&#8217;s work ethic is that of a lone tinkerer, working on ever smaller parts.</strong> Their society full of cogs / boxes, a larger one working on smaller ones.</p>
 
 <h3>split with Atsushi at Kagoshima harbor</h3>
 
 <p>Sleep / nap. feels for [censored name] still linger. Human contact? Atsushi [todo: check name] split, allows me to think beyond destined-travel. This country is too cold to do anything, or feel like doing it. Long daydream of being president, conversation with Jon Stewart, life as president, morals, social development, etc., stars freely go in and out, as do friends.</p>
 
 <p><strong>I need her [ambiguous her]&#8230; I just want to live.</strong></p>
 
 <h4>Ideas over the past few days:</h4>
 
 <p><strong>Sensory deprivation caused by cold and loss of sight via sleeping bag over head inside a tent beneath dreary weather.</strong>
 - Also leads to depression, oversleep, etc. <strong>Just to maintain homeostasis.</strong>
 - Less sun power to enhance sight.</p>
 
 <p>$ Daydreams as conversation imagined &#8211; example: president / Jon Stewart day dream, wedding speeches, etc&#8230;. media-oriented, written-oriented can be generalized to <strong>sign-oriented &#8211; using signs as basis of rational decision-making.</strong> Look at nutrition facts, not the food (CaloriMate, coffee, cola zero, cigarettes, alcohol zero, etc.). Look at hitchhiker&#8217;s sign, not (not understanding) the thumb. Look at maps, not reality. Look at the phone, not reality. <strong>Design on canvases, not {on} reality.</strong>
 |
 Japan designed an efficient society devoid of life.
 $ - <strong>The material of Japan is designed / developed. So it feels ideal / others ways of life are impossible; though it is just of the mind.</strong>
 |{?}
 [next idea / argument]
 Japanese culture is rational through signs, therefore:
 $ * It rationalizes toward capitalism, survival, and comfort (when under capitalism).
 $ * <strong>Money-actions are not creative: it is not creative to buy something</strong>, there is an infinite amount of things to do {/ one can do}, and it all starts with communication ({ideas, talking, }games, play too!).</p>
 
 <p><strong>Japan makes me feel capitalistic-rational, ad opposed to communicative-creative</strong>, free-rational <strong>(of Taiwan).</strong>
 |
 <strong>Creativity (communication, education, ideas, information, etc.) pays. Commodities (form, manufacture) really is old money.</strong></p>
 
 <p><strong>Japan is stuck in the 80s / 90s in development, material, social, fashion, ethic, culture, politics, etc.</strong>
 - They wear business suits without reason, uniforms, work without reason, all old ideas, no thought, only manufacture.</p>
 
 <p>Japan is completely developed. Farms mechanized. People fit to property.</p>
 
 <p>$ <strong>Property fixed, deemed (/ pedestaled) by culture</strong> [cool argument]; <strong>Leads to a fixed society in time and space.</strong>
 - {Because the culture is so private and exclusive, those with property seem keep and / or gain wealth even more easily: coin laundries, restaurants, hotels, etc. There are probably too many laws and policies for people to start their own businesses to compete, and, furthermore, is probably not even thought of due to cultural reasoning. Since all material on the property is designed by some collective consensus, there is little change to the material world. No gentrification, but no creativity for capitalism either. Just creating capital for survival, not experiences.}</p>
 
 <p>$ Although Taiwan is less developed materially, social organizations [<strong>maybe not needed?</strong>], healthcare, etc., it is more developed in the mind. It skipped commodity-capital-rational that post-war Japan and Korea had, instead, it relies on service (time spent together: tourism), information, education &#8211; because <strong>social development is more important than material organization.</strong></p>
 
 <p>Japan&#8217;s (culture) repression crosses to sex (porn), drugs (cigarettes and coffee), and probably hard drugs and prostitution. These are used out of addiction / need, not fun / social as in America. <strong>They are used to replace social activity</strong> &#8211; to ease the mind, perhaps to artificially move some brain cells (inhibitors, etc.).</p>
 
 <p>Fukuokan women spent time and money on beauty. Beautiful {in appearance} through daily work. {Ugly in ethical make-up.}</p>
 
 <p>Only [censored name], [censored name], and maybe [censored name] seem normal {to me}.</p>
 
 <p>Mostly mothers with children hitched<a href="#">?</a> me a ride. They care. Have time. Not super work-oriented. Move at the speed of life. In time with life. They care for those that feel cold as they do their children. They are human [something here?], unlike their cold male counter-parts. The male drivers know nothing apart from their specific jobs, barely able to drive, and completely unaware of their surroundings, no care for proximal society {, or even other people}.</p>
 
 <p><strong>Perhaps all of socio-cultural Japan occurs though the internet</strong> via written language &#8211; jobs, sex, talk, etc. Nothing is physical-oral. And I am only looking at and listening to the physical-oral reality, not caring for written language, therefore it may be impossible for me to understand their mind, decision-making, thought, ideology, education, etc.
 - {I was unwilling to read. That&#8217;s too boring. Too unsocial.}</p>
 
 <p><strong>Manga / drawing as a way of communicating, because they live so much less, that they must use {simplified} images to convey {a} reality instead of words. They are out of tune with reality [reverses an old thought].</strong></p>
 
 <p>[$ todo: give up rural?]
 Creativity / Osaka maybe the way out of this decades old society [/ culture].</p>
 
 <p>Japan is only good as industrial machines - to manufacture / design a working product for comfort, longevity &#8211; traits [end goals] of Japanese society.</p>
 
 <p>[The end for now. Look for farms. Then go to Osaka.]</p>
 
 <h3>at gas station waiting for hitch to Kumamoto</h3>
 
 <p>People who have time, and/or are more human pick me up: elderly (retired?), women (old and young. I feel the young ones often appear to look at my face to see if I am a female), young people (though maybe less have cars, using public transport instead). People who have cars <em>are</em> the suburban capitalists.
 |
 $ <strong>Suburban capitalists destroy the world without awareness (knowing). They were born into via place, time (, nearby culture), in capitalistic country, accumulate capital, waste the world in the process.</strong> The countries with wealth organized themselves to be better at gaining capital, but missed on human values (including value for nature).</p>
 
 <p><strong>To wait is to waste life. Suburban capitalists wait, city-goers create {keep creating}.</strong></p>
 
 <p><strong>Japanese cars are shaped like Japanese houses, and the Japanese social structure: boxes, of various sizes, compounded together.</strong></p>
 
 <p>[idea:]
 <span class="math">\[$\]</span> Tools for anti-alienation (/ altering human-values / altering human behavior)
 $$$ - tool / app for mothers to list / sell cooked food (servings left, cost, ingredients cost, etc.), unused ingredients, minimize food waste, increase human interaction, remove organized food (chain restaurants, {industrialized food products at super markets}, etc.).</p>
 
 <p>By developing, Japan has organized their country to a few food items: ramen, sushi, fried food, etc. It over-uses those ingredients, because capitalism and property has created chain restaurants, super-market industrialized products, vending machines. Developing countries have a better food industry because the ingredients (raw food) has not been industrialized / organized. That explains my love for vegetable markets in Chinatowns {in American cities, Southeast Asia}, and Taiwan: you eat the raw food &#8211; no work in-between necessary. Food should not be organized. Eat what your country you live in grows.</p>
 
 <h3>another session, perhaps at the coin laundry store near the park</h3>
 
 <p>Sleepy, after afternoon nap, woke up at 5pm, feeling it a waste to hitchhike at night, missing the scenic beauty of Japan, but, perhaps worth it for the random experience. Cities and highways are boring anyway: repetitive suburbs, yet, I must see for myself &#8211; never know. Perhaps need to travel via Google Maps more. Maybe needed a day&#8217;s rest after that long bike ride. Fuck it. Let&#8217;s go. Nothing to do here, or at least it feels&#8230; Hmmm&#8230; can at least hitch out of Kyushu, perhaps Yamaguchi.</p>
 
 <p>travel tips:
 Kid&#8217;s playgrounds are attached to neighborhood parks and usually have bathrooms. 24-hour coin laundry shops can be found nearby, providing warmth, and maybe even an electrical socket or television.</p>
 
 <p>Only with a bicycle (that I stole for a day) was I able to reach farms, land, non-concrete, with shrines and traditional, old houses that emanated an Yilan feel, cheap / fresh vegetables and ingredients too! {Finally a livable place.}</p>
 
 <p>Hitching local roads at night (11pm&#8211;3am, until 8am) was near impossible, {perhaps especially} as a male, dark, non-Japanese. SAs / PAs vary from large sleepy truck stops to a tiny strip mall where few vehicles stop at, trapping hitchhikers on a highway island.</p>
 
 <p><strong>There is no interaction that occurs outside, aside form parks / playgrounds &#8211; that is all the &#8220;nature&#8221; people get in this super-developed world.</strong></p>
 
 <p>The mountains of Japan seem untouched, beautiful nature. Perhaps it is the best place to live?</p>
 
 <p>The rural areas too are developed, unlike Taiwan&#8217;s tiny farms, there are large apartment complexes nearby, large greenhouses and farmland bunched together so that people cannot walk through, blocking human interaction / access to nature [for efficiency,] via urban planning. Farms need walkways (dirt!) through them.</p>
 
 <p><strong>Japan is the death of society / Societal death. Society has lots it&#8217;s life and exchanging it for longevity, comfort, convenience, health, safety.</strong></p>
 
 <p><strong>It requires non-decision-making {non-thinking} robots to live in Japan (and the suburbs).</strong></p>
 
 <p><strong>All real Japanese films take place at the house because nothing occurs outside of it.</strong> Miyazaki and Takohata are the saviors of this drab society, mindlessly destroying itself {yet, their own lives contradict the ones they depict in their films &#8211; they are not living on farms, they are sitting in studios in Tokyo etching out more animated films. At least, Miyazaki is.} Keichi shows the drab suburban reality best, with actual modernity as its setting &#8211; pachinko parlors, supermarkets, road, and only media {ex. history of trams} as a savior [escape] from it.</p>
 
 <p>[probably written after glancing at a few manga books:]
 Manga is still terrible. Narrow. More narrow than Hollywood films&#8230; I decided that in 6th grade {thinking of anime on Toonami on Cartoon Network}.</p>
 
 <p>[todo: perhaps written twice]
 A nurse said there is no need to learn English. It shows how <strong>insular</strong> Japanese culture is, and how <strong>uncaring for other societies and minds they are</strong>. | <strong>They are the American suburbs.</strong> | <strong>They were born into it, organized their lives {and their surroundings} according to it, and know nothing outside of it.</strong> A nurse! Does the nurse not care for how nurses act in other societies? Read their biographies?</p>
 
 <p>80s / 90&#8217;s fashion in Japan in 2016 is funny. Levis jeans. High heels. Striped shirts. lol. Back to school sale?</p>
 
 <p>&#8211; [break]</p>
 
 <p>Maybe Japanese culture is OCD (about organization, cleanliness, health, etc.); It can&#8217;t handle disorder, nature, it must conquer it. Taiwan can handle messiness, more broader information via reality &#8211; they process information in the present; Japan relies on past, planned information &#8211; schedules, {designs}, etc.</p>
 
 <p>Many lonely pangs. Dreams of any girl I&#8217;ve met recently &#8211; gold digging, gigalo, lots of sex. Japan is socially repressed, so I feel (socially and sexually) repressed too. Manga are probably the daydream and wet dreams of the society.</p>
 
 <p>Lots of thoughts on food industry &#8211; and how it affects everything &#8211; farms, distribution, transport to supermarket, $ limited organization of food to fit culture, etc. It is vastly better to not organize food into meals &#8211; that&#8217;s a cultural problem.</p>
 
 <p>I mentioned concrete. &#8220;Concrete jungle&#8221; should be applied to Japan and South Korea, perhaps moreso than tiny Hong Kong, because these jungles are much larger&#8230;</p>
 
 <p>&#8230; the &#8217;burbs have taken over all land. Earthquakes and vlocanic eruptions fight through concrete, but the car and road system is constantly repaired ot maintain order {human order, homeostasis of human order}. Here, it is easy to see the nature vs artificial themes of Miyazaki and Takahata films.</p>
 
 <p>Perhaps the society communicated digitally, a digital social world. Nothing much occurs in reality; &#8211; How boring! Perhaps they create JRPGs to escape the boring reality of suburbia. They generate in-game capital as opposed to real capital. They don&#8217;t understand that they could live in a different way, as they live it through JRPGs / MMORPGs.</p>
 
 <p>Drab.</p>
 
 <p>I want to fuck and get money, like an animal, several times. Gold-dig. Just be a house-husband. That&#8217;s all. Take care of her, {her} body and mind, to allow her to efficiently do her work. Surely I can just use some kind of dating site for this? Or try living in a city. Osaka? Taipei? New York?</p>
 
 <p>&#8211; [mini-break]
 <strong>Japan&#8217;s social structure (ie) creates a very voyeuristic culture. They peer from within their cars, houses, {to the outside}, and into other&#8217;s cars, houses.</strong> | <strong>They don&#8217;t interact verbally, instead, they just look, judge, from appearance, and continue their programmed routine;</strong> making them shallow, as they don&#8217;t judge by mind.</p>
 
 <p>&#8211; [mini-break]
 I thought by coming to Japan, I would get to experience a culture that acts more upon reality, physicality. I got it. I just didn&#8217;t know that that kind of non-verbal-language-orientation would be <em>so</em> cold. I thought that much could be communicated through reality, actions. But they don&#8217;t {even} act! Perhaps, it is because I am not acitng. I need to be aggressive, or at least, just less passive then them. I need to {my normal} outgoing talkative {self}. But I don&#8217;t speak their language, nor care much for it. Hmm&#8230; I just have to be with them, next to them. No need for intense philosophical conversation, or travel questions. But they&#8217;re so {fucking} boring! At least, outside they are. Maybe inside, they are like [censored name] {act differently with people outside and within social relations}&#8230;Yeah, I just need to get active again, somehow, despite how being broke excludes me from most places. I need active people. I haven&#8217;t met a person similar to an active Taiwanese, or foreign traveler yet. Japan is so dead.</p>
 
 <p>&#8211; [TV break]</p>
 
 <p>Japanese people spend their life indoors, and by habit, have made the world feeel merely concrete to indoor places</p>
 
 <h2>internet readings</h2>
 
 <p>some random reading via Google, all read <em>after</em> the trip. Nothing deep or lengthy.</p>
 
 <h3>highlights from internet readings</h3>
 
 <p><a href="http://afe.easia.columbia.edu/at_japan_soc/common/all.htm">some thing by Columbia</a></p>
 
 <blockquote>
 <p>ROLES IN THE FAMILY
 &#8230;
 The fact that Japanese fathers in contemporary urban households spend so much time at work, and the company demands on them are so great, means that they often really have very little time or energy to spend with their children, and so not only does the responsibility for raising children, overseeing the education, fall onto the mothers, but fathers themselves are absent, removed, from the children&#8217;s lives.
 - true. Only the mothers seemed human, and therefore picked me up as I hitchhiked.</p>
 
 <p>COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY EDUCATION
 One of the really interesting paradoxes about Japanese education is that you have a very rigorous, very intense educational system up to getting into college, and these very difficult entrance exams. And once students get into college, oftentimes people joke that college is the four-year vacation in a long and hard educational life. Once you&#8217;ve made it into college, you&#8217;ve made it to wherever you&#8217;re going to get educationally.
 - true for Taiwan too, and probably much of Asia. It seems to be the problem of entering an exclusive social group. It&#8217;s ugly; They&#8217;re ugly.</p>
 
 <p>GROUPS: INSIDE/OUTSIDE
 Another important aspect of the way in which social relationships are structured in sort of the day-to-day interactions of people in Japan, is a strong consciousness of in-group versus outside-the-group boundaries. And this gets expressed in all kinds of settings.</p>
 
 <p>Students are very conscious of the school they go to and the class within the school that they&#8217;re part of, and that forms sort of a shell, a social shell, that people who are within the shell are expected to interact with one another rather informally and rather intensely, and interact with people outside that shell, or outside that boundary, in a more formal, more distant, perhaps more hierarchical way.</p>
 
 <p>So at schools, in families, there&#8217;s a clear distinction between who&#8217;s a member of a family and who&#8217;s not; in communities, there are clear distinctions between people who belong to the community and people who are outsiders; in companies, a very clear sense of division; in political parties; even in ethnic relations, relationships for example between Japanese and Koreans who live in Japan, the sense of insider versus outsider status.</p>
 
 <p>THE IE AND GROUPS
 It&#8217;s very difficult to say exactly why Japanese social relations take the form they do. Why are social relations hierarchical, or why is there a strong emphasis on in-group versus outside-the-group interactions? You couldn&#8217;t necessarily come up with an historical reason for this, but certainly there are parallels to other sets of social institutions. If you look at the traditional family structure, for example, the so-called ie, as it&#8217;s known in Japanese, it is a kind of a family, a kind of a kinship organization which puts a great premium on understanding hierarchy and rank, that every member of a traditional family stands in a very complicated set of relationships with every other member, but they can all be ranked in some kind of a hierarchical form.</p>
 
 <p>So, for example, the eldest son occupies a social role that is quite distinct from a second or a third or a fourth son. The eldest daughter occupies a rank and position that is quite distinct from younger daughters. Certainly fathers and mothers occupy different ranks from their children and so forth. So, it&#8217;s a very hierarchically structured social unit, and some people would argue that that&#8217;s sort of a template for understanding why hierarchy is such an important part of Japanese social relationships.</p>
 
 <p>In another sense, the fact that the traditional Japanese family system puts this great emphasis on defining sharply the boundaries between people who are members of the extended family and people who are going to have to leave — that is to say people who are going to become non-members in the future — is a social template for this emphasis on in-group, inside-the-boundary membership versus relationships outside or across a boundary to people who are not part of that social group.</p>
 
 <p>CONSENSUS
 Consensus is a well known part of Japanese social relationships. It seems, to an outsider at least, as if everything in Japan is decided by this sense of harmony and this sense that everybody has to agree. And there are all kinds of trivial examples that you can come up with, like if you watch a group of Japanese businessmen sitting down for lunch, it&#8217;s likely that everybody around the table will order more or less the same dish, and people point to that and say: &#8220;A-ha! this is a harmonious society; everything has to be equal.&#8221;</p>
 
 <p>And indeed, Japanese talk a lot about how to preserve this sense of equality. One of the ways in which they do this is by making sure that any decision that affects a group as a whole is at least going to be circulated around and discussed amongst all its members. So indeed, Japanese organizations do often appear to have a much higher degree of consensus about policies, about aims, about aspirations, than would be true in an equivalent American group.</p>
 
 <p>On the other hand, it doesn&#8217;t mean that Japanese inherently agree with one another, or that there isn&#8217;t conflict in society, but rather that conflict is managed within the group, and conflict is negotiated against other demands of personal interaction, personal social relationships. And eventually the goal is to, through conflict and through very carefully managed conflict, to come up with some kind of unified position that everybody can agree with.</p>

 <p>Japanese social structures consistently remould human associations in terms of an archaic family or household model (家 ie?) characterized by vertical relations (縦社会 tate-shakai?), clan (氏 uji?), and (foster-)parent-child patterns (親分・子分 oyabun, kobun?). As a result, the individual (個人 kojin?) cannot properly exist, since groupism (集団主義 shūdan-shugi?) will always prevail.</p>

 <blockquote>
 <p>It is advantageous for a man to remain in the group in which he starts his career and move up step by step in the course of time. It is very difficult for him to move from one group to another, because he can rarely succeed in breaking any of the vertical links already established between individuals in the other group.</p>
 
 <p>Japanese organizations regularly suffer from what they call &#8220;sectionalism&#8221;</p>
 
 <p>There are no successful functional groups built on a coalition or federation of subgroups.</p>

 The music makes me feel alive, but it’s a fake sensation. How long I lived with music during my suburban life. Without it, I am dead, in need of sensation[, experience], people, nature, love.
 
 a thought during my readings today, and a huge extension of that thought:
 Critical Theory and Taoism are opposites, yet, I am attracted to both. The search for problems in society and making it aware for social change, and, living in harmony with one’s self and with nature (including people). The first is political, the second is apolitical. Then, doesn’t that make Taoism ignorant, apathetic, and therefore unawaringly conservative — permitting the conservation of the existing cultures of people? Critical theory desires to change culture. <strong>I want to change culture, yet I want to be in one.</strong>
 
 Should I begin again, alone? Make a few close friends? Work one’s way from individual to society?
 
 Should I go into the wild and reside there? Create my own society?
 
 Were all those [my past] civil community ideas useless? Because their [contemporary cultures’] values will never be as extreme as mine, no matter how much I politic with them?
 
 I have no desire to help, work, live, with people whom I don’t value. I used to value Taiwanese people. What happened?
 
 I shall find my own place in nature [vs city]. With kids. With a girl. And we will play all night. And it will be beautiful.
 
 Fuck the world.

 [I heard this (for the first time) either the same day or the next day:]
 <blockquote>There are no cities, no cities to love.
 There are no cities, no cities to love.
 <strong>It’s not the city, it’s the weather we love!</strong>
 …
 <strong>It’s not the weather, it’s the nothing we love!</strong>
 …
 It took so long for me to see it
 Hope’s a burden or it sets you free
 Wandered through the void of you
 Wandered through the void of me
 <strong>I’ve grown afraid of everything that I love.</strong>
 …
 <strong>It’s not the weather [nothing], it’s the people we love!</strong>
