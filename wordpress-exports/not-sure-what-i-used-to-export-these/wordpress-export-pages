I'm Rahil. And this is my digital room. It's kinda like my actual bed-room: an organized mess. On this site you can see <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/portfolio">things I've made</a>, <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/valuable-things-ive-written">organized things I've written</a>, <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/blog">things I've recently written</a>, and even <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/archives">more things</a>... One day I’m going to add some rooms, one for <a href="http://wolf.rahilpatel.com">my spirit</a> and one for my <a href="http://will.rahilpatel.com">my will</a>! <em>Note:</em> I’ve been out of the digital world for several years. During that time, I’ve lost my server twice and very-likely lost my hard-drives too; When I hastily recovered this site, I used the latest version of software, a 4 year difference, so, beware of site problems. On this page, you can see what I try to do, how I try to do them, and what I like or like to do. <h2>What I try to do</h2> Ideal: To influence people to consistently interact with people nearby, as opposed to exclusive social networks and media, as a method of gaining wisdom by creating new social experiences, resulting in an increase of physical awareness in local society (and therefore better decision-making and increase of sharing), knowledge embedded in public [urban] material, and generally healthier communities / cultures and better places. Real: Consistently try to make a positive impact [within the restrictions of time and space, and unfortunately, within the economic system and culture]. <h2>How I try to do them</h2> Disorganize: Create new experiences in public spaces (urban interventions) bringing awareness to components of reality and new possible ways to live, fostering interaction for the public, and throwing people off from their habituated daily routines Organize: Create public spaces with my values, attracting others, then let the values of the people in the space radiate outward, into the public, consistently creating new ideas (social interventions) and designs by combining local material, new media and technology, provoking playfulness from the public, allowing more people to make civil decisions for themselves, increasing the amount of sharing of material, incrementally making a better environment to live in and a better society to participate in? Whoa. That came out kind of beautiful. Possible lifestyles: 1. Live in a developing area. Empower people. <a title="DIY Ethics in Developing Countries" href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/diy-ethics-in-developing-countries">Consume local materials and local culture as inspiration to create stuff</a>, functional and artistic, whilst working. 2. Live in or near a <a title="New York and Taiwan" href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/new-york-and-taiwan">developed city</a>. Work toward <a title="Urban Planning for Solidarity" href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/urban-planning-for-solidarity">creating a better city</a>, by creating <a title="Decision-making, Civics, and Technology" href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/decision-making-civics-and-technology">tools to help</a>, and remember to take trips out of the city! 3. Keep drifting between <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/time-and-space-in-anthropology">various human settlements</a> and social organizations. 4. Keep drifting between the aforementioned lifestyles.
