<a href="http://rahilpatel.com/rgbrgbrgb.html">Play the game</a>.

This is my entry <a href="http://experimentalgameplay.com/blog/2012/03/economy-in-march-2012/">Experimental Gameplay March 2012</a>. The theme is economy. It is the result of developing a game without thinking about the core game mechanic first. It is a complete failure.

Controls:
Player 1/Player 2 - description

A/' - Red
S/; - Green
D/L - Blue
F/K - hold and press RGB to direct military to retreat, halt, and attack
G/J - hold and press RGB to tell workers to get a specific resource (by default it auto-gathers)

Finger mapping:
Player 1, use right hand
Player 2, use left hand

Player 2's controls mirrors Player 1

A/' - index finger
S/; - middle finger
D/L - ring finger
F/K - little finger
G/J - little finger

How to play:
It's just a simple real-time strategy game, except you play with a keyboard. Blue units gather resources, green do nothing as of now [supposed to research/upgrade], red can attack.

Other Notes:
As of now battles are sad due to lack of solid objects and pathfinding. Also, there is no win condition.

Post thoughts:

What was envisioned:
1000s of units, flocking, simple yet competitive gameplay (think Hokra), precise controls (think QWOP), color-collar workers (and a statement against classism), resource renewal (and a statement against resource consumption), map based off of image, able to upload map (MS paint is now a map editor!), large resolution to zoom in and out.

Why it didn't work:
Decreasing the amount of player input increases the amount of AI programming. Competitive games require more balancing and tuning than non-competitive games. Multiplayer on the the same screen isn't as fun because it lacks fog of war.

Also, I felt like crap while making this. It was forced. It just didn't feel right.

Future:
I feel like a game could be created with these initial ideas, but I can't bare to look at it again.
