<h2><a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/poorly_designed_upgrades.html">Play the game</a></h2>
&nbsp;
This game is my submission for this month's Experimental Gameplay Project competition. The theme is <a href="http://experimentalgameplay.com/blog/2011/11/upgrade-in-november-2011/">upgrade</a>.

I used ActionScript, <a href="http://www.flashdevelop.org/wikidocs/index.php?title=Main_Page">FlashDevelop</a>, and <a title="FlashPunk" href="http://flashpunk.net/">FlashPunk</a> again.

Last time I promised EGP and myself the game would be experimental. It's certainly more experimental than my previous games, but not quite enough. The ideas are there but I cheated myself and conveyed them on a shoot 'em up genre game. Never again!

<h2>Instructions</h2>

<h3>Goal</h3>
Experiment with different upgrade setups to prevent enemies from reaching the bottom of the screen in various challenges.

<h3>Controls</h3>
wasd or arrow keys to move
space bar to fire
f to autofire (on by default)

while in sandbox screen:
- and + to decrease or increase enemy HP (can hold the key down)
[ and ] to decrease or increase enemy spawn rate (can hold the key down)
u to enter the upgrade screen
1, 2, 3 to start a challenge

while in upgrade screen:
left click on the canvas to draw the current upgrade. This works similar to the pencil tool in a graphics editing program
*you can only draw on the ship or a neighboring pixel of the current upgrade
*you cannot overlap other upgrades
*protip, each <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_neighborhood">4-connected neighborhood</a> is treated as a separate gun
escape to go back to sandbox screen

while in challenge screen:
escape to go back to sandbox screen

<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcmpjIfb0OQ">Oooone mooore thing</a>. The boosters and challenges are actually poorly designed. Really, it's bad.
