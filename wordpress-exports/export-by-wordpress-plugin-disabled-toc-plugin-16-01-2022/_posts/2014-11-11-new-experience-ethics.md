I had trouble choosing the middle word of the topic. Experience, stimuli, or external stimuli. I am not sure.

There's an interview of Chomsky on the 21st century where he mentioned the effects of modern technology can lead to stimulus addiction (? may not be accurate term).

Stimulus addiction leads to irrational behavior, sure, but <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/creativity-external-stimuli-cities-and-suburbs" title="Creativity, External Stimuli, Cities, and Suburbs">external stimulus invokes creativity</a>, which seems to be lacking from rational intellectuals.
