It seems that in developing countries, there's a tendency to use self-expression to do good, especially in charity, when simply what's needed is actual work.

Sometimes this is good, as in innovations.

Usually it isn't, as in any charitable organization higher than the community level.

The cost in time of moving money, allocating other resources, and trying to innovate results in far less actual work.

If one has the time, forget the ideas and do some actual work. Be part of the society in aid. One should always be able to think while working.
