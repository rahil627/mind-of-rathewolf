<blockquote>Neighborhood in City: Adds more complex[?] community, more political* (decision-making at a higher level), larger problems, more complex problems, more distraction, more diversity? (not really, for Taiwan), more shared economy, more people (can use media), more social? (more shallow?), less materially creative. - a thought during my three months in Taipei</p></blockquote>
