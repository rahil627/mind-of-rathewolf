Also, how memories are created.



<blockquote>>9/3/13 in Seoul
Time flies without motivation.
...
Art drives me when I am alone. My art has to be social, to keep track of time.
...
As I sit alone at the train station, the faces of people appear again. Care for others arise, along with criticism. I begin to watch time.</blockquote>





<blockquote>9/18/13 in Osaka, Japan
I left the hostel without direction because I hate being indoors. It feels as if the world moved without me. I need to be with people all of the time, yet I need to maintain my high level of thinking.</blockquote>







<blockquote>9/22/13 in Tokyo, Japan
New experiences make time pass slow. While traveling I'm always experiencing something new. Meeting new people, seeing new things, taking a new path, eating something new, thinking about these new things. There is no routine in traveling. I wonder, will I be able to translate this to work? Most work requires routine. Only the design stage is new. How will I be able to satisfy my hunger for the new while working?</blockquote>











<blockquote>9/24/13
One moment I'm fighting for every minute to create a new experience. Another moment time passes freely, without motive.
...
The long commutes on subways are damaging. Time flies.

Monotonous commutes are indeed dangerous.</blockquote>





<blockquote>10/22/13
Need to give self deadlines. Without it I just live, without work and life. Deadlines should exist for both. Need to travel and be social to understand length of time.</blockquote>







<blockquote>>9/3/13 in Busan
Mandy said "You feel it was long because you experienced so much". It's true. You have to constantly create new experiences.</blockquote>









Time seems to be linked to social time, work, and more.

Time is maximized during new experiences, hence people often feel traveling feels much longer than it is.

Therefore, [is life maximized by maximizing time?](http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/maximum-time-ethics)





<blockquote>In India:
6/27 and 6/28 were wasted days. I'm thinking about what to do rather than doing it. It's good to think all of the time, but one also had to be doing. I shouldn't be planning full-time. I could be making games! Helping people! Allocate time to planning, don't let it hinder your work. Balance time. Wander. Don't be do inclusive.</blockquote>



If I spend time not being social, then I consider it a waste of time.
