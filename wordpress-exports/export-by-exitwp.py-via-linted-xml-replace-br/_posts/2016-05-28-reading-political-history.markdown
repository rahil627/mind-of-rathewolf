[aka Criticism of the Experience of Reading Political Histories]

Thoughts after [listening to] 25 minutes of [A History of Rome by Hadas Moses](https://archive.org/details/HadasMosesAHistoryOfRomeFromItsOriginsTo529A.D.AsToldByTheRomanHistorians):

The format is wonderful: chronologically ordered narrative with huge quotes from ancient sources{, starting with Livy}. It reads like one huge story!

But, is it worth reading such text? It’s so unreal, granted, it does start with the more legendary ancient stuff. Can _anything_ be learned? I highlighted and noted so few bits, especially when compared to, say, [Georg Simmel](http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/the-metropolis-and-mental-life), or any biography: In a biography I can try to see why a person takes the actions that they did; In philosophy, I can match many of my own ideas to the philosopher’s, picking up some words, mapping some ideas together, or with better reading actually learn something or provoke thoughts. But **reading a narrative (political) history seems as dull to the mind as reading a narrative fictional book: It feels as if there is no social reality to to try to understand actions; There are no ideas to better understand the world and people’s minds.** **The society is simply too distant.** **Perhaps reading about Romans war is similar to reading about New Guinean tribes war.** **The difference in the experiences of reading and watching a documentary is phenomenal.** My mind works during the experience of watching. Things click, neurons are linked.

I will continue, but I think, watching any sort of socially real film is a far better use of time.

Perhaps reading social history is a better experience.
