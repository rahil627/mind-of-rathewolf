In my <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/creativity-external-stimuli-cities-and-suburbs" title="Creativity, External Stimuli, Cities, and Suburbs">"Creativity, External Stimuli, Cities, and Suburbs</a> post, I go at length explaining a personal philosophy of something close to materialism and Dewey's aesthetics.

After a long period of nomadism and travel, I finally spent time in one place: my parent's house. I ended up here because I came back to America to attend some weddings, and perhaps attend school. I decided against the latter part.

How my mind transformed from extreme creativity to extreme oversleeping is pretty fascinating experiment, like studying the effects of prison on prisoners, and it serves as a lesson of personal human nature. I don't know if this applies for everyone, but perhaps artist personalities, and my mom.

First two weeks:

Two weeks to a month:

Second month:

Third month:

Fourth month:


Other thoughts:
What's frightening is the fact that I stayed so long. I kept telling myself I just need to sell my stuff, but I could have done that through a garage sale in the first to weeks. I could have been much more active about it. There's definitely a passive element about selling things online. It's like having a store and waiting for people to buy your things.

I also had what I called the "thoughts project", which is <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/valuable-things-ive-written" title="Valuable Things Iâ€™ve Written">basically everything I've written during the past few months</a>, and involves naive philosophical analysis of my own past. <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/no-more-writing" title="No more writing">Unnecessary</a>, but oh well now.
