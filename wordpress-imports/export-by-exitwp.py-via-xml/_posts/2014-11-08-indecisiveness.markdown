<blockquote>10/10/13
It's the indecision that kills me. Apartment hunting. Fucking indecision. Just keep on living!</blockquote>



When one has the will to do anything, making decisions becomes rather difficult.



<blockquote>in Korea:
Searching for something that doesn't exist</blockquote>



Along with indecisiveness is the search for the ideal. Always looking for something better, as opposed to making with what one is given.
