THIS IS JUST A THOUGHT

Purpose:
I feel, that in competitive video games, there is a massive amount of decision-making going at amazing speeds, and somewhere in that time, there are things in psychology, particularly decision-making, where some new knowledge may exist.

What to do:
Detail advanced, real-time decision making through professional-level competitive games. Write how professionals win. Write it empirically, then scientifically.

Why video games over past games?
Chess is turn-based. Sports are real-time, but there's a strong emphasis on physical. Video games have physical limits too, but it's less prominent, usually limited to hand-eye coordination.

Is there a reason to examine real-time? What's the difference between decision making in real-time as opposed to turn-based? Time, duh. More decisions are made during a period of time, and, there's not enough time to make the rights ones.
