I feel I have a rather unique characteristic that has greatly influenced my life: I only talk to people in proximity.

The norm is is to keep relationships healthy via communication over the telephone, e-mail, and video-chat. I only talk communicate to people if they are physically near.

If I live in a house in a suburb, then I am alone.

If I live in a city, I have the people in the city.

If I live in a house with several roommates, I will talk to those people more than more-valued relationships.

If I live in another country, then I do not talk to the people in the last country.

I believe I do this because I have no control of my social impulses. If someone is nearby, I talk. If there is a delicious piece of foodstuffs nearby, I eat it. It's not much different. It's a pleasure to talk, as it is to eat. The proximity of pleasures result in action. Perhaps that makes me [hedonistic](http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/hedonism).

This trait alone causes destruction of relationships, makes me prone to [social determinism](http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/social-determinism), and eventually leads to severe [adaptation](http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/adaptation) to different societies.

The only way to make me work is to put me in a work place. The only way to make me talk is to place me in a place filled with people. The only way for me to make art is to place me in a place where many people make art. The only way for me to work for charity is to place me in a place that requires charity.

Sure, I make decisions, sometimes getting out of society and therefore escaping social determinism, but, for the most part, it seems my life has almost entirely depended on where I place myself. Therefore, [the placement](http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/the-ideal-neighborhood) of myself is of utmost importance.
