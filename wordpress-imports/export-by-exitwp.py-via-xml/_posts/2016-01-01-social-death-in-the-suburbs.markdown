[I think this was written directly to the blog, not from my thoughts file, perhaps written soon after coming home, in the suburbs]



<blockquote>"He who is unable to live in society, or who has no need because he is sufficient for himself, must be either a beast or a god." - Aristotle</blockquote>


Or socially die.



<blockquote>"That to study philosophy is nothing but to prepare one's self to die." - Cicero</blockquote>


When a person is socially detached from nuclear family and institutions in a suburban or similar environment, the person has no other society to be part of.

The city is a society, which may be viewed as the form of a institution or family.
