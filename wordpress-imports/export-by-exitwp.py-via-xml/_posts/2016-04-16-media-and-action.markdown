From a thought today:


<blockquote>"...The second essay is about whether 'personal essays' ever cause action: has anyone acted upon an _Essai_ by Montaigne[?], as people acted when Blow made _Braid_, or when Vertov made _Man with a Movie Camera_? Did the games and films made in response [to them] merely create more communication, as opposed to action? No [and Yes?]. It's the accessibility of the medium that increases the chance of acting in response. 'I read the news today' is a different experience from watching _Night and Fog_, and that itself different from what I imagine and hope the experience of playing _This War of Mine_. The closer the experience of a medium is to real experience, the greater the chance of acting in response."</blockquote>
