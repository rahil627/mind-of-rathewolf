<blockquote>10/15/13
Don't do things because you have to, on a to do list. Do it because you want to.</blockquote>



I often fall for this. Wake up, get in a work zone, create a list of things to do, do them. It's routine. But it should never exceed being a day old. Everyday is a new to do list.

I see a lot of people do this in the form of e-mails. Perhaps the digital form of this ethics: e-mail ethics.
