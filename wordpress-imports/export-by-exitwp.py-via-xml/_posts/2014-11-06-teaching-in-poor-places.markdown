With today's technology, it doesn't seem the cost of teaching is much.

I would think a few laptops, internet, a secure public place, and a watchman who can teach how to use the computer to learn suffices. If the people do not know a language, then the teacher must teach them just enough language to use the computer for them self-learn. Perhaps there should be a liberal curriculum too, mainly taught through Wikipedia. For advanced peoples, OpenCourseware. Every populated place should have such a space.

I think curious people would naturally be attracted to it.
