<blockquote>At home before leaving America:
Perhaps daydreaming is what the mind does when it is not occupied, not motivated.</blockquote>



Seems to occur after experiencing life (whether real or media) and then placing oneself in a lifeless area. As if there is no outlet for creativity (dialog, sense-data), so it comes out as a dream.

Sensory deprivation experiments agree.
