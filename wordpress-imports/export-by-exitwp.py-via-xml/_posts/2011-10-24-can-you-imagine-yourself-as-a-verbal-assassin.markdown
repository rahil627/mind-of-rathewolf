[Play the game](http://www.rahilpatel.com/verbal_assassin.html).

The title of the post is the theme I chose at my first game jam, [Castle Lab: Parsons x Babycastles](https://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=261046020606382).

I've also written more about my about experiencing [my first game jam](http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/my-first-game-jam).

EDIT: To reduce frustration, I added controls to repeat the last command. Subsequently, the game's length has been reduced to five seconds!
