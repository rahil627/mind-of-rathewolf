<p>It's wonderful what you can do with Google.</p>
<p>My sister told me her car stereo wasn't working. I checked it and found that it displayed Err-3. After a little Googling I discovered this is part of the anti-theft system and must have triggered after the battery had recently died.</p>
<p>Here are the steps to reset the anti-theft system:</p>
<ol>
<li>Check if your car has a sticker with a code written on it. Here's a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgfRmBo7Pu0">video</a> that shows possible locations. If you find the code, skip to step 5.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.team-integra.net/forum/blogs/morningz/43-g3-radio-removal.html">Pull out the stereo</a>Â to obtain the device serial number and keep it pulled out.</li>
<li>Write down the serial number so that you don't have to remove the stereo again</li>
<li>Get the code by supplying the serial number, VIN, and other information. Try this <a href="https://radio-navicode.acura.com/">website</a>. If that doesn't work, call a dealership, ask for parts and services, and tell them you need the code. If they don't give the code or try to charge you, try another dealership.</li>
<li>If you came from step 1, disconnect the car battery, wait 30 seconds, and reconnect. If not, disconnect the power cable from the car stereo, wait 30 seconds, and reconnect.</li>
<li>Enter the code</li>
<li>Celebrate</li>
</ol>
