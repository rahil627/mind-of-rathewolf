<p>From a somewhat old (1-6 months) paper:</p>
<p>urban planning problem -> [Chris Marker-like] video -> use Facebook comments to talk about it (Facebook comments as forums) -> leads to something?</p>
<p>problems in reality [can be social?] -> media -> create and publish project on a crowdsourcing platform (i.e. Kickstarter) -> implement</p>
<p>examplesï¼š<br />
people don't have or wear motorcycle helmets -> Humans of Taiwan photo -> crowdsource petition (to influence companies, law organisations, etc.) -> keep updated<br />
broken traffic light -> photo -> find correct organization to inform -> create application to automate process (i.e. FixMyStreet)</p>
