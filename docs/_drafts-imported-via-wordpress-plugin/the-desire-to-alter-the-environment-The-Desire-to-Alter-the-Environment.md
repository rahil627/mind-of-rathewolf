<blockquote>In nature, or village like settlements, there is freedom because there is space, to build and accumulate. In the city, there is not. Instead, one spends more time restructuring [altering] the [existing] natural and space, instead of building. That **is** the creative replacement. To rethink space within an already built environment, because the city currently is the best form it can be.
