<p>[todo: just publishing drafts, really deserves more thought]</p>
<p>Usually thought of while traveling, especially between a developing area and a developed area. It is probably the cause of the onset of philosophic mania.</p>
<p>One wonders, how everything came to be.</p>
<p>How did all of this material accumulate. Â How did the knowledge of putting these materials together pass. Who accumulated it. Why were they chosen. Who they where chosen by.</p>
<p>How cities became clones of other cities. How ideas are copied. How narrow the knowledge of a society is.</p>
<p>How people, especially laborers, become spatially and habitually trapped.</p>
<p>And so on.</p>
