<p>alternative titles: The Ideal Way to Travel</p>
<p>Perhaps associated with <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/time-and-space-in-anthropology">Time and Space in Anthropology</a> and <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/the-ideal-work">The Ideal Work</a>.</p>
<p>notes:<br />
from a sheet of paper:<br />
live -> area problem -> *(low) work<br />
live -> *(high) art<br />
live -> love (place and people)</p>
<p>daydreams:<br />
go around Taiwan with a group<br />
kickstart projects together<br />
find room<br />
move to next town<br />
continue<br />
[to ideal work]</p>
<p>ideas:<br />
digital libraries<br />
  - teach how to use e-reader, read. films. other arts.<br />
  - in squatter spaces!<br />
    - [vs public government buildings, such as libraries]<br />
    - add sign, no cost<br />
  - comfortable space as self-education<br />
    - not education / social [? maybe meaning that the space is not social to the locality?]</p>
<p>from another sheet of paper:<br />
50 days walk, 30km/day<br />
France to China<br />
no belongings / small backpack is enough<br />
  - no tent if enough friends<br />
  - [hmm. I donâ€™t think this is possible. Need backpack with tent, like Patrick, then hitch.]<br />
no worry<br />
  - need traveler friends, need to walk around Taiwan</p>
