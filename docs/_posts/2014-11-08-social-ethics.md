> A hostel or NGO would be fun. It&#8217;s closer to life than new media, and involves interaction with people.

> 10/15  
> Keep meeting people. Keep talking. Keep staying in social spaces, or outside.
> 
> I can&#8217;t stand being inside a room anymore. I must stay outside, day and night. Sleep outside, somewhere, in the public, with people.
> 
> I can&#8217;t spend time alone. At least, not on a computer, or not after a long day of living.
> 
> You must stay social. Otherwise the day is wasted. Keep talking to people.
> 
> I must find a way to keep life exciting!
> 
> I&#8217;ve lost interest in the world. I don&#8217;t want to even get out of bed. I need to be more social. I need more work. I need to keep doing things.

In Taiwan, I came to a point where I didn&#8217;t want to do anything alone. Social determinism at max effect?

Sure, I had choice of the people, what to talk about, and what to do, but that made everything limited to mutual interests.

I was happy as long as I was social. It was as simple as that.
