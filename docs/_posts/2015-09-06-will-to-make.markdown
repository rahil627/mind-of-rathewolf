A thought from reading the title of a book, Will to Architecture.

The thought reoccured from Place: A Short Introduction:


<blockquote>All over the world people are engaged in place-making activities.</blockquote>



Humans will to make material and digital things. To materially put together a better world; To design a better world.

This is a subset of [Will to Experience](https://mind.rathewolf.com/will-to-experience). Making is an experience, but one does not have to make to have an experience.
