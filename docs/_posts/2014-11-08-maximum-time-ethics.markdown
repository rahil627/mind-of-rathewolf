Related to my thoughts on [time perception]( https://mind.rathewolf.com/time-perception ), is life maximized by maximizing time?

In cities, people experience more social interactions.

I wonder how nomadic peoples feel about their perception of time. I imagine they'd go crazy if you stuffed them in a cubicles.
