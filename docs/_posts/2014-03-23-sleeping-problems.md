This post is part of [a self-assessment II](http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/a-self-assessment-ii)

During my first job, I self-diagnosed myself to have [Delayed Sleep Phase Syndrome](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delayed_sleep_phase_syndrome). The wikipedia article described several problems of my life during school. In retrospect, I now know this is only one comorbidity of a larger problem.

There is a clear division of the times I wake up: **delayed**, **inconsistent**, and **on time**.

  <ul class="toc_list">

      <a href="#delayed">Delayed</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="#inconsistent">Inconsistent</a>

      <a href="#on_time">On time</a>
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

## <span id="delayed">Delayed</span>

This occurs when I am intrinsically motivated, without external factors affecting me, or during which I have no reactions to external stimuli.

It seems if I have a normal social life or daily schedule &#8212; a job, personal work, school, I can stick to it, somewhat. I just happen to wake up a little later, perhaps 10:30AM. I&#8217;d sleep well, wake up spontaneously, feeling refreshed. I adapted my life to fit my body&#8217;s schedule, resulting in a less social, yet extremely physiologically healthy life. It probably netted in more films then real social activities.

During scheduled work &#8212; school and my first two jobs, I&#8217;d choose to come in at 10:30AM to 11:00AM, which is about when my brain wakes up. I&#8217;d start out well, but as my motivation waned I came in later. Perhaps I became less excited about life outside of work &#8212; exploring the city, social connections. Or, more likely, my jobs were repetitive, and I failed to find ways to continue being creative in such limits. Eight hours without creativity should make anyone somewhat intelligent mental.

In SF the second time and NY, when I was working on my own things, or things of mutual motivation, I woke up on a delayed schedule. During the summer, I&#8217;d often wake up at 10:30AM, but come winter time It would be a lot more inconsistent.

## <span id="inconsistent">Inconsistent</span>

This occurs during winter depressions, or as previously mentioned, when motivation in work &#8212; school and work &#8212; dwindles.

During winter depression, and even worse, the combination of winter and school or work, the schedule is severely impaired, resulting in [Non-24-hour sleepâ€“wake disorder](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-24-hour_sleep%E2%80%93wake_disorder). I&#8217;d wake up anywhere between 10:30AM to 4PM, sleeping at inconsistent times, unable to wake up at desired times, advancing my sleeping schedule forward, until I have to reset it.

## <span id="on_time">On time</span>

(business hours)**:**  
Being on time requires my goals to be attached to some external factor.

During the summers of my childhood, I wake up early because I&#8217;d want to go out, to enjoy the sun, to have more time to play with my friends, to have more time to explore with my bike. Also during family trips, I&#8217;d wake up alongside my family.

During most of my travel in Asia, I woke up on time. Perhaps this is because most people slept or went home when the sun went down. Or, because I was consistently motivated. _Travel is special time where intrinsic motivation is affected by external stimuli._

In an extreme case, in Laos, where there was no light or electricity available, I woke up at 5am. Was it because there was no light, I had nothing to do (no computer, no one to talk to, no light to write), or I wanted to wake up with people the next day? Probably a combination of the three.

In another case, I&#8217;d wake early if my current goal or objective involved the interaction of other people whom have normal circadian rhythms:

In hostels, I&#8217;d often sleep with others, and, I&#8217;d wake up at the same time as they did. The action of people getting up in my room served as a time device. It was quite motivating ([Social Loafing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_loafing)?), and socially healthy. I loved talking to others while getting ready. Similarly, many families in India live in a single room, waking up together at 5AM. Another reason maybe because I am schizoid and normally don&#8217;t have anyone to talk to in the morning.

During Humans of Taipei, my main goal was to talk to people, so I&#8217;d wake up early to maximize work time. At that point, I was so focused on other people I felt there was no reason to be awake at night as there was nothing for me to do that would advance me toward my goal. I&#8217;d sleep happily with the sounds of neighbors and people on the streets from a nearby open window.

&#8212;  
Being schizoid, it&#8217;s possible for me to live without any external factors, leading to a misaligned sleep schedule. Intrinsic motivation and a delayed sleep schedule has had the most prolonged routine sleep schedules. The times I was _on time_ were all very temporary. Being inconsistent usually means I was depressed.
