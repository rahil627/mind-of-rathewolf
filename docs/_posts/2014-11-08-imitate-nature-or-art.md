A thought sometime in Japan:

> In the past, whenever I watched a great film, I worked harder, my ambitions grew, it cleared my head of all of the silly small things, like a good scooter ride. It kept me in direction, and that direction is creating great films. But isn&#8217;t that because I&#8217;m consuming it? Copying. Creating what I&#8217;m consuming. That&#8217;s wrong, isn&#8217;t it? Is it right to copy something you love?

Also going over thoughts in San Francisco and New York, it seems I consumed a lot of games, and used them as a basis for creativity. The results were not so good.

This is a common thought of any artist, and I will answer that it is wrong. One can learn the aesthetic idea of other arts, but the [creation of it should be based on sensual input](http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/a-design-strategy-for-data) from life, aka nature.
