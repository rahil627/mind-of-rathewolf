[TODO: translate to Chinese, related to [What is Worth Writing](https://mind.rathewolf.com/what-is-worth-writing)]

[related writings: [What is Worth Reading?](https://mind.rathewolf.com/what-is-worth-reading), [Notes on Translations of Ancient Literature](https://mind.rathewolf.com/notes-on-translations-of-ancient-literature), [Lessons in Research of a Past Time](https://mind.rathewolf.com/lessons-in-research-of-a-past-time), [The Kinds of Literature and the Extraction of Ideas](https://mind.rathewolf.com/the-kinds-of-literature-and-the-extraction-of-ideas)]

I've read less books than most elementary school children in my lifetime. I was never able to extract as much value per time with enjoyment factored in in books compared to other mediums, and empericism. Wikipedia was enough. Much recently, [I listened to an audiobook of Great Ideas in Philosophy provided by the Great Courses](https://mind.rathewolf.com/why-read-the-western-philosophy-canon); That was successful. After that, I figured out I had huge gaps in my knowledge, and proceeded to create a list of things I felt could be worth reading (or listening) to.

Non-fiction:

Philosophy:
- For philosophy
- **For the organization of knowledge**
- **For learning how to communicate using human language**
- **ethics**- ethical treatises by Aristotle, various essays by Bertrand Russell
- **politics** - The Republic, Politics, The Prince (and other works), and something more modern
- thought-provoking philosophical writings - Philosophical Investigations
- Use audiobooks to consume slowly while simultaneously doing something

Natural Sciences:
- For knowledge of science
- **For understanding how research works**
- prefer large historical or trans-discipline pieces that are up to date - GÃ¶del, Escher, Bach; Thinking, Fast and Slow; A Brief[er] History in Time, Big History from The Great Courses, etc. These books compete with online lectures.

- Biographies of great people:
-- For knowledge
-- For fun, **for experience** (possibly my favorite reading material, possibly because it's most humane; The same reason applies to coming-of-age films)
-- Use Wikipedia
-- Many of the online lectures cover biographies, to allow more insight on their decisions
-- A single book with multiple biographies is best, to ease the comparison of lives

- Essays by great essayists, and possibly the short writings of other great writers
-- Experience good writing to help develop one's own writing style
-- **For knowledge**, and fun (same reasons as biographies of great people)

- Language books

[the following was added two years later]
- History
-- **To understand how the world came to be**, especially useful **to see how cultures have developed**
-- Similar to biographies, a single book with multiple histories of societies is best, to ease the comparison of societies
-- Can use Wikipedia

[certain kinds of non-fiction literature](https://mind.rathewolf.com/the-kinds-of-literature-and-the-extraction-of-ideas):
- anthology
-- Similar to a single book with multiple biographies or multiple histories, a single book with multiple writings is a much better **experience** than any single book
-- Similar to History, **to see how cultures have developed**
-- history of philosophical writings
-- history of essays
-- history of literature
--- all of these should be encompass the world, not just the West

- **reader**
-- **For ideas**
-- _Penguin Great Ideas_ series
-- Readers for knowledge categories: _The Media Studies Reader_, etc.


Fiction:
- For art
- Contemporary masterpieces, including comics, especially those of Nobel Prize winners in 
Literature. Although, I would likely choose other mediums over this, and empiricism over all all art

[the following was added two years later]
- Magical Realism
-- **for thought-provocation**
-- Calvino, Borges, etc.

- Philosophical Fiction
-- **for thought-provocation**

- Travel Literature
-- **For fun, for experience** (similar to reading biographies)
-- Travel Journals
--- for experience and fun
-- Travel Guides
--- for history
-- Travel Fiction
--- for experience and fun
