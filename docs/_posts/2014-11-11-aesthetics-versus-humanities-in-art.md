While consuming art, I&#8217;d skim through products at lightning speed, not impressed by any because I experienced the aesthetic before, [craving for something new.](http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/new-experience-ethics "New Experience Ethics")

When an artist creates something there are two directions, which can be combined: to further aesthetics and to further humanities. Humanities contains knowledge that can educate. Aesthetics has a method of transmitting knowledge that can provide a better means to educate.
