It's natural for people to have an idea of the nature of the world, but I find it unnecessary for such lengthy proofs.

If one is presenting a new proposition, then it should be just that. No book required. The proposition will likely be invalidated soon.

Books should be formatted and ordered as such: proposition, a few of the best examples that cover nearly everything.

The books that brought this thought at the time were Antifragile, and Surfaces and Essences.

Only one of the charts was needed for Antifragile. Surface and Essences could have used some graphical representation of examples too.

Books that have several ideas, say The Death and Life of Great American Cities, should still follow another format: all propositions, then all propositions again with examples (cases).

Gladly, some fine people usually take care of the extraction and post it to Wikipedia.

God, books are such a lame way to transmit content.

At least when Wittgenstein wrote a book, he tried to explain the world. Every line was a proposition. And he did it in 75 pages. That should be regarded the standard of philosophy books.
