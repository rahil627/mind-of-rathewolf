After watching a great film I am inspired. It just happened again with [35 Shots of Rum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/35_Shots_of_Rum).

After experiencing a great film I reflect upon my life, my past present and future.

It reminds me of what&#8217;s important in life, placing everything into perspective. I immediately begin to remove anything invaluable nearby (close browser tabs, clean my desk, clear my schedule) so that I can focus on what&#8217;s most important. It keeps me on track.

Sometimes it pulls me away from my lucky American life, and makes me think about how wastefully I&#8217;ve spent my time and money. It holds me close to the ideal [simple life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_living). [[Man Push Cart](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_Push_Cart), [Turtles Can Fly](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtles_can_fly)].

Sometimes it reminds me that I am not the only one and that I am normal. [[The Apu Trilogy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apu_trilogy), [Tree of Life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tree_of_Life_(film)), [Fish Tank](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish_Tank_(film)), [Still Walking](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Still_Walking_(2008_film))].

Other times I just ponder. It&#8217;s sadly one of the few times in my life I am not busy, away from the distractions of the modern world. An ample portion of my thoughts text file was written after watching a film. I owe films for providing me these crucial moments. I&#8217;ve made many life altering decisions during them.

Of course it&#8217;s not limited to films. It could be a [a Youtube video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znIXyFh6dsI), a [comic book](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchmen), a crucial life event, anything. But it&#8217;s so convenient to watch a film in two hours on my laptop knowing that there&#8217;s a great chance of it affecting me. It&#8217;s a tough decision to risk my time on anything else when I know I can be satisfied with a film.
