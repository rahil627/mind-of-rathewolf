Two recent posts have been about finding a _good_, if not the _best_ translation and/or publication of ancient literature: [Dao De Jing (道德經) and Zhuangzi (莊子) ](http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/laozi-and-zhuangzi-translation-hell)and [Plutarch&#8217;s Lives](http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/parallel-lives-translations). I took the notes and the lesson from those posts and placed them here.

## <span id="notes_on_publishers">notes on publishers</span>

1. **Penguin [Classics]**  
&#8211; good, simple book format (which is becomes more important when reading digitally): intro, then straight to content  
&#8211; most often has (/ probably can afford and copyright) the best translation  
&#8211; for prolific authors they to divide works by several books often with different translators, which would make word choices inconsistent, and reading a bit more cumbersome (again, doubly important for digital reading)  
2. Oxford [World&#8217;s Classics]  
&#8211; similar [to Penguin], but in the case of Plutarch&#8217;s Lives, failed by excluding content

### <span id="western">Western</span>

1. **none**  
&#8211; if one doesn&#8217;t like the Penguin edition, then some other random publisher may have a better publication (physical format, digital format, extra content) or translation (Hackett, Basic Books, Yale, Cambridge, etc.)  
&#8211; if one wants complete works, again, some other random publisher may have it (ex. Modern Library for Aristotle and Plutarch&#8217;s Lives, Hackett for Plato, Landmark for Ancient Greece historians, etc.)  
*. Delphi Classics eBook  
– made for digital! Translator is probably limited to those that are available for free, which could be crusty.  
x. Harvard [Loeb Classical Library]  
&#8211; avoid, billingual Greek and very literally translated English, made for anal academicians. Perhaps for ease of secondary translators?

### <span id="eastern">Eastern</span>

1. **none** – probably some random native translator who is capable of thinking like an ancient native person, such as Yutang Lin and Wing-tsit Chan for ancient Chinese philosophy  
&#8211; **_A Source Book in Indian Philosophy_ by Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, Charles A. Moore** (Princeton)  
&#8211; **_A Source Book in Chinese Philosophy_ by Wing-tsit Chan (Rongjie Chen)** (Princeton)  
&#8212; published after helping Watson with _Sources of Chinese Tradition_ (Columbia)  
&#8211; **_The Wisdom of China [and India]_ by Yutang Lin** (Random House, Modern Libary, picked it up)  
&#8212; he wrote a history of Chinese philosophy and even translates the Chinese sources, [which I thought were the best translations of Laozi _and_ Zhuangzi](http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/translations-of-laozi-and-zhuangzi-a-translation-hell). For the India portion, I believe he writes the history, but selects translations of sources.  
&#8211; _Readings in Classical Chinese Philosophy_ by Ivanhoe and Norden (Hackett)  
0.5 Columbia (Watson, Mair)  
&#8211; seems like a niche monopoly here. Better than Penguin and Oxford for Laozi, and maybe Zhuangzi too (**doesn&#8217;t this show how insular and analytic (read: anal) Harvard and Oxford are? And on lesser level, how insular even Columbia is for not having more, smaller societies?**)! Also has [anthologies and &#8220;source books&#8221;](http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/the-kinds-of-literature-and-the-extraction-of-ideas) for literature _and everything else_ respectively, which basically cover the entirety of a civilization&#8217;s past:  
&#8211; **[Introduction to Asian Civilizations series](http://cup.columbia.edu/series/introduction-to-asian-civilizations)**: Titles beginning with &#8220;Sourcebook&#8221; are comprehensive, &#8220;_Encompassing social, intellectual, religious, and literary traditions_&#8220;; Titles with &#8220;Sources&#8221; is an &#8220;_abridged introductory collection [that] offers students and general readers primary readings in the social, intellectual, and religious traditions_&#8220;. So, **it seems that they are composed of [social, intellectual, and religious histories](http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/lessons-in-research-of-a-past-time). That&#8217;s a huge feat. That makes this series, as far as the East goes, the most valuable source that I have found thus far.**  
&#8212; _Sourcebook of Korean Civilization:_ Volume One: From Early Times to the 16th Century by Peter H. Lee  
&#8212; _Sources of Korean Tradition:_ Volume One: From Early Times Through the 16th Century by Peter H. Lee, Yôngho Ch&#8217;oe, Hugh H. W. Kang  
&#8211; Victor A. Mair is the editor of _The Columbia History of Chinese Literature_, _The Shorter Columbia Anthology of Traditional Chinese Literature_ , _Columbia Anthology of Chinese Folk and Popular Literature_, and a translator of at least Laozi, Zhuangzi, and Xunzi.  
&#8211; Burton Watson is _the translator_ of a ton of things all over East Asia (Hanfeizi, Xunzi, Mozi), and often a editor of the anthologies by Columbia, including one for Chinese poetry, _The Columbia Book of Chinese Poetry: From Early Times to the Thirteenth Century_, and one for Japanese poetry, _From the Country of Eight Islands: An Anthology of Japanese Poetry_.  
*. Shambhala  
&#8211; I ran into this publication for Laozi (3 good translations) and Zhuangzi, quite modern and good

## <span id="a_recent_lesson">a recent lesson</span>

> **The Oxford and Harvard editions are _&#8220;scholarly&#8221;_, which for us mortals translates to _less accessible_, which opposes one of the tenets of art, making them detrimental to life. Leave those insular schools and their [publishing] presses to their insular selves. For the future: simply get the Penguin edition, if not, jump into a crusty old translation, more convenient if it&#8217;s within a [reader or sourcebook](http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/the-kinds-of-literature-and-the-extraction-of-ideas), if not, _do something else_.**
