A bit contrasting to [Will to Make](https://mind.rathewolf.com/will-to-make).

It's not about organizing, it's about experiencing.

Things that are considered experiences, but not making: talking, performing, physical movement.

The Will to Experience and the Will to Make might be a spectrum. The spectrum might be a major characteristic of culture.
