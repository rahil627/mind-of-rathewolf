[TODO: translate to Chinese, related to [What is Worth Writing](http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/what-is-worth-writing)]

[related writings: [What is Worth Reading?](http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/what-is-worth-reading), [Notes on Translations of Ancient Literature](http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/notes-on-translations-of-ancient-literature), [Lessons in Research of a Past Time](http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/lessons-in-research-of-a-past-time), [The Kinds of Literature and the Extraction of Ideas](http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/the-kinds-of-literature-and-the-extraction-of-ideas)]

I&#8217;ve read less books than most elementary school children in my lifetime. I was never able to extract as much value per time with enjoyment factored in in books compared to other mediums, and empericism. Wikipedia was enough. Much recently, [I listened to an audiobook of Great Ideas in Philosophy provided by the Great Courses](http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/why-read-the-western-philosophy-canon); That was successful. After that, I figured out I had huge gaps in my knowledge, and proceeded to create a list of things I felt could be worth reading (or listening) to.

Non-fiction:

Philosophy:  
&#8211; For philosophy  
&#8211; **For the organization of knowledge**  
&#8211; **For learning how to communicate using human language**  
&#8211; **ethics**&#8211; ethical treatises by Aristotle, various essays by Bertrand Russell  
&#8211; **politics** &#8211; The Republic, Politics, The Prince (and other works), and something more modern  
&#8211; thought-provoking philosophical writings &#8211; Philosophical Investigations  
&#8211; Use audiobooks to consume slowly while simultaneously doing something

Natural Sciences:  
&#8211; For knowledge of science  
&#8211; **For understanding how research works**  
&#8211; prefer large historical or trans-discipline pieces that are up to date &#8211; GÃ¶del, Escher, Bach; Thinking, Fast and Slow; A Brief[er] History in Time, Big History from The Great Courses, etc. These books compete with online lectures.

&#8211; Biographies of great people:  
&#8212; For knowledge  
&#8212; For fun, **for experience** (possibly my favorite reading material, possibly because it&#8217;s most humane; The same reason applies to coming-of-age films)  
&#8212; Use Wikipedia  
&#8212; Many of the online lectures cover biographies, to allow more insight on their decisions  
&#8212; A single book with multiple biographies is best, to ease the comparison of lives

&#8211; Essays by great essayists, and possibly the short writings of other great writers  
&#8212; Experience good writing to help develop one&#8217;s own writing style  
&#8212; **For knowledge**, and fun (same reasons as biographies of great people)

&#8211; Language books

[the following was added two years later]  
&#8211; History  
&#8212; **To understand how the world came to be**, especially useful **to see how cultures have developed**  
&#8212; Similar to biographies, a single book with multiple histories of societies is best, to ease the comparison of societies  
&#8212; Can use Wikipedia

[certain kinds of non-fiction literature](http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/the-kinds-of-literature-and-the-extraction-of-ideas):  
&#8211; anthology  
&#8212; Similar to a single book with multiple biographies or multiple histories, a single book with multiple writings is a much better **experience** than any single book  
&#8212; Similar to History, **to see how cultures have developed**  
&#8212; history of philosophical writings  
&#8212; history of essays  
&#8212; history of literature  
&#8212; all of these should be encompass the world, not just the West

&#8211; **reader**  
&#8212; **For ideas**  
&#8212; _Penguin Great Ideas_ series  
&#8212; Readers for knowledge categories: _The Media Studies Reader_, etc.

Fiction:  
&#8211; For art  
&#8211; Contemporary masterpieces, including comics, especially those of Nobel Prize winners in  
Literature. Although, I would likely choose other mediums over this, and empiricism over all all art

[the following was added two years later]  
&#8211; Magical Realism  
&#8212; **for thought-provocation**  
&#8212; Calvino, Borges, etc.

&#8211; Philosophical Fiction  
&#8212; **for thought-provocation**

&#8211; Travel Literature  
&#8212; **For fun, for experience** (similar to reading biographies)  
&#8212; Travel Journals  
&#8212; for experience and fun  
&#8212; Travel Guides  
&#8212; for history  
&#8212; Travel Fiction  
&#8212; for experience and fun
