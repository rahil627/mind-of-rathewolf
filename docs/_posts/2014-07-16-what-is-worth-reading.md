I've read less books than most elementary school children in my lifetime. I was never able to extract as much value per time with enjoyment factored in in books compared to other mediums, and empericism. Wikipedia was enough. Much recently, <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/why-read-the-western-philosophy-canon">I listened to an audiobook of Great Ideas in Philosophy provided by the Great Courses</a>; That was successful. After that, I figured out I had huge gaps in my knowledge, and proceeded to create a list of things I felt could be worth reading (or listening) to.

Non-fiction:

Philosophy:
- For philosophy
- <strong>For the organization of knowledge</strong>
- <strong>For learning how to communicate using human language</strong>
- <strong>ethics</strong >- ethical treatises by Aristotle, various essays by Bertrand Russell
- <strong>politics</strong> - The Republic, Politics, The Prince (and other works), and something more modern
- thought-provoking philosophical writings - Philosophical Investigations
- Use audiobooks to consume slowly while simultaneously doing something

Natural Sciences:
- For knowledge of science
- <strong>For understanding how research works</strong>
- prefer large historical or trans-discipline pieces that are up to date - GÃ¶del, Escher, Bach; Thinking, Fast and Slow; A Brief[er] History in Time, Big History from The Great Courses, etc. These books compete with online lectures.

- Biographies of great people:
-- For knowledge
-- For fun, <strong>for experience</strong> (possibly my favorite reading material, possibly because it's most humane; The same reason applies to coming-of-age films)
-- Use Wikipedia
-- Many of the online lectures cover biographies, to allow more insight on their decisions
-- A single book with multiple biographies is best, to ease the comparison of lives

- Essays by great essayists, and possibly the short writings of other great writers
-- Experience good writing to help develop one's own writing style
-- <strong>For knowledge</strong>, and fun (same reasons as biographies of great people)

- Language books

[the following was added two years later]
- History
-- <strong>To understand how the world came to be</strong>, especially useful <strong>to see how cultures have developed</strong>
-- Similar to biographies, a single book with multiple histories of societies is best, to ease the comparison of societies
-- Can use Wikipedia

<a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/the-kinds-of-literature-and-the-extraction-of-ideas">certain kinds of non-fiction literature</a>:
- anthology
-- Similar to a single book with multiple biographies or multiple histories, a single book with multiple writings is a much better <strong>experience</strong> than any single book
-- Similar to History, <strong>to see how cultures have developed</strong>
-- history of philosophical writings
-- history of essays
-- history of literature
--- all of these should be encompass the world, not just the West

- <strong>reader</strong>
-- <strong>For ideas</strong>
-- <em>Penguin Great Ideas</em> series
-- Readers for knowledge categories: <em>The Media Studies Reader</em>, etc.


Fiction:
- For art
- Contemporary masterpieces, including comics, especially those of Nobel Prize winners in 
Literature. Although, I would likely choose other mediums over this, and empiricism over all all art

[the following was added two years later]
- Magical Realism
-- <strong>for thought-provocation</strong>
-- Calvino, Borges, etc.

- Philosophical Fiction
-- <strong>for thought-provocation</strong>

- Travel Literature
-- <strong>For fun, for experience</strong> (similar to reading biographies)
-- Travel Journals
--- for experience and fun
-- Travel Guides
--- for history
-- Travel Fiction
--- for experience and fun
