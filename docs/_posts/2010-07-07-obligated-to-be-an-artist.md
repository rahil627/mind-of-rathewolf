> During the past few weeks, here at home, I&#8217;ve been thinking a lot. Mostly because I am unemployed and not working on anything. I&#8217;ve slowly been coming to term with my own personality, who I am. **I&#8217;m a lone adventurer, who embarks on his own path, experiencing everything personally, with an open heart. Nobody&#8217;s opinion has influenced me in another direction. Every choice I make is composed purely of my own judgement and feeling.** Living in a house near family and friends restricts my personal adventures. I never turn down favors, and I&#8217;m quite technical, so I&#8217;m often helping others. A job in a company feels the same. I&#8217;m just helping someone else. &#8220;It&#8217;s nothing personal, just business&#8221;. None of it is satisfying as a personal adventure.
> 
> Now that I&#8217;ve come closer to knowing myself, I think I know what I can be. Using my personal experiences and expressing it through a medium, I think I could be a great artist. I feel that I have the taste and vision of one.
> 
> Only a small percent of people have the intelligence and ambition of my close friends. An even smaller percent have my personality. Even less have the opportunity. Being part of such a small group, **I almost feel obligated to be an artist**.

> This is precisely the experience which should have occurred at a much earlier age. After high school should be the the norm, not after college; and after elementary school should be the goal.
