My blog contains a pattern language, and many posts titles are design patterns ([take care of locality](http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/will-to-take-care-of-locality), [hourly ethics](http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/hourly-ethics)), and many emphasized words within the posts are design patterns (todo: get a few).

This is what naturally happens when one communicates through a known human language: ideas are created, represented as words, and when writing about philosophy or design, patterns could be created, patterns to another language: [a pattern language](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Pattern_Language).

Writings on design, such as [this one](http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/noisy-transportation-destroys-social-atmosphere), seem to tend to easily generate [design] patterns.

_Philosophy patterns_ appear more often in continental philosophy and critical theory, both of which are more dialectical, perhaps requiring the creation of words to describe social phenomenon. Marx&#8217;s terms come to mind: _accumulation of capital_, _surplus value_, Zizek&#8217;s _surplus enjoyment_, and core critical theory terms such as _ideology_ and _hagemony_.

This was [one of the reasons I enjoyed reading these kinds of philosophy](http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/why-did-i-read), and believe it&#8217;s worth getting a dictionary of critical theory terms. I wanted to describe reality, but didn&#8217;t have a language to describe it. Then I read some philosophy (substantially from Wikipedia) and found the terms they used useful; They helped me write and more accurately transform my thoughts into a human language.

But, reading is not necessary, as I mentioned before, words can always be created. People know the idea behind ideology and hagemony, but just don&#8217;t know the word. Connecting ideas to existing words is not necessary. Perhaps even, it results in negative consequences, because **the language&#8217;s vocabulary (and grammar?) narrows and limits what thoughts can be represented or expressed. It is always better (including efficient) to create words [as opposed to finding and using existing ones]; It is creative and more fun. Perhaps it is even better to not create words, instead prioritizing visual, audio, and reality.**
