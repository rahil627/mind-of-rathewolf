Often, when I say action in my thoughts, I mean, a thought that leads to me taking an action via my will in a way I feel that is progressive. Progress can be anything from finding something delicious to eat to helping a friend.

The goal of this ethics is to [constantly be doing something](http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/artist-productivity-ethics "Artist Productivity Ethics") &#8220;progressive&#8221;, which makes me happy, and in some kind of direction I want.

> I feel that work life balance is different. It suggests that they are separate entities. I never feel that way.

> Some people can go to an office work, come out, then enjoy life with their family and friends. The work hard play hard lifestyle. I&#8217;m constantly trying to fit work in life. I have no hours. I just live.
> 
> This is when I felt that computer programming is devoid of life. I spent most of the time in public places: outside, in a cafe, with friends, still it wasn&#8217;t enough. I wasn&#8217;t experiencing enough life. I filled the void with films. The only way to do a computer programming job is by having a steady workplace, at home with a family, or in place with friends.

> Start shit all of the time. Run around. Events. Work. Doodle Tangle. Public Art. All that shit all of the time.

> New experiences make time pass slow. While traveling I&#8217;m always experiencing something new. Meeting new people, seeing new things, taking a new path, eating something new, thinking about these new things. There is no routine in traveling. I wonder, will I be able to translate this to work? Most work requires routine. Only the design stage is new. How will I be able to satisfy my hunger for the new while working?

> I need to live during my night hours. Stay outside, in a park, in a hostel. Keep living and working, even during off hours.

Living and working is another way to word this ethics. To maximize life, strive toward goals, yet survive.

Now, I think my conception of _work_ for a long time was the office kind, sitting in front of a computer and doing work. That is what society conditioned me to think work is. That or my programming degree, I don&#8217;t know. So I only felt I was doing work when I was working for a job or making a game. Did I not view everyone else&#8217;s jobs as work? The service industry? I don&#8217;t know. I&#8217;m just glad my conception of work has changed since then.

> Talking to the French guy was relaxing. He worked in Australia at Dominos as a pizza deliverer. He loved it. There was no worries. He and his co-workers would find ways to scam Dominos for money &#8212; discount codes, petrol in a can, pizza status codes. He had fun. He had a new experience. That&#8217;s all that matters, isn&#8217;t it?

Almost hippie ethics.
