Heat is a sensual experience, and it causes one to do things. For one, to get something cold to drink or drink for homeostasis.

Further, it sure does feel that heat causes action, maybe even a bit more instinctual.

Some historians say that climate matters, scientists say it doesn&#8217;t. Broadly thinking, Africa compared to Europe.

I think the heat combined with the city has some detrimental effects.

> You&#8217;ve become so lazy. Sit in air conditioner. The heat is destroying you. Take a lighter backpack.

I believe in this thought, I meant lazy in not doing work toward current direction, that the heat was driving me to do other things.
