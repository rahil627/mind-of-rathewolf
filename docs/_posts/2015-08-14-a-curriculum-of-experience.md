In the recent past, [I read pretty widely](http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/a-liberal-arts-self-study-curriculum), it was an experience itself &#8212; learning English again, learning about a history of knowledge (philosophy), traveling through books, comparing reality, arguing &#8212; not so much passive reading. Now that I&#8217;m a bit more focused, my readings have become focused too, chosen based on past experiences and interests, before I began reading.

Though it does seem quite useless, impractical, lacking good use of working memory, and surely doing this out of current poor habit, over-organizing because I&#8217;m not in an active city, space, or social area, I&#8217;ve found that in the past, during downtime or simultaneously with work I end up consuming what media I do have most conveniently available &#8212; my smartphone &#8212; and so having some interesting media, is sometimes worth the trouble.

After writing down a few books of interest, it seems the theme of my interest is experience. If one is not experiencing, perhaps in a situation where creating experience is difficult, or one is simply in a lazy mode, perhaps books about experience will make one want to experience again, or remind oneself of one&#8217;s past experiences. Contrarily, if one is experiencing, then the books can be read simultaneously, and actually learn something from a book.

Hahahaha jk, [books suck](http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/no-more-writing). If you must, let it be a practical handbooks and Wikipedia articles.

## <span id="update_17915">Update 17/9/15</span>

It seems that this post, like the [organized things I&#8217;ve written](http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/valuable-things-ive-written), is ever evolving. It started with creating a library related to experience, but as I used Wikipedia to [attach words to ideas I&#8217;ve previously thought of](http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/no-more-writing), I&#8217;ve created an endless library of things I&#8217;ll never read. Though paradoxical, again, like the organized things I&#8217;ve written post, it turns out to be seemingly useful. Useful in the organization of ideas, but, as I often previously fought against during more active times in life, organization of ideas is not useful, it only seems so. 1) There is no need. The ideas exist, and always have since their inception. Instead of using time reading Wikipedia to [map ideas to words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_metaphor) as I just did here, I could be having experiences, creating new ideas, affecting the world, being a part of society. 2) It is uncreative. I could be creating my own words, which is an experience itself. 3) The use of vocabulary is limited to academics, making it inaccessible to the public. 4) The use of vocabulary influences others to conform to it, leading to the creation of a singular language&#8230; It&#8217;s circular logic, and it wastes real social time. It&#8217;s passive learning. One doesn&#8217;t need to know the political term or history of autonomism to understand it; If one can imagine an autonomous society, for example, most towns in Japanese role-playing video games, it is enough. Furthermore, along with the mapping of words to ideas, a useless history of philosophy often comes about. Only the mapping is what was seemingly important, nothing else. One should spend no further time on it. A google search of the description of an idea and appending &#8220;Wikipedia&#8221; to it usually suffices. If not, make a word up for it.

## <span id="update_271115">Update 27/11/15</span>

It seems much of readings have shifted from experience toward critical theory, probably first as a result of wanting to describe the world, then later from being lazy and not experiencing and over-organizing.

## <span id="update_231215">Update 23/12/15</span>

[The People, Place, and Space Reader](http://peopleplacespace.org/toc/) may be the closest description of the world and mind to my mind. Just a look at Simmel&#8217;s &#8220;Metropolis and the Mental Life&#8221; harks [my early philosophy](http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/valuable-things-ive-written#early), which I wrote after much city experience. Previously, I thought David Harvey came closest, and before that, more classical critical theorists, but a glance at Harvey&#8217;s books one quickly learns that he relies on past human geographers and critical theorists and quotes them a lot to build a philosophy of human geography, and a glance at classical critical theorists one gets lost in the critiques of everything, failing to synthesize it with the contemporaneous world, especially the modern city. Forget classic philosophy canons (epistemology [maybe even pragmatism!] and political philosophy); Forget written language (save these essays). In the search of talking to someone about somethings, I&#8217;ve been distracted and misled by philosophy, distracted during the search for subjects that I wanted to talk about, misled by people who use past philosophers to help them write in a kind of infinite regression, and to larger forms of writings, which are more frequently mentioned in Wikipedia and sometimes even more easier to download (problem with digitization of essays and journals?), as opposed to contemporary concise essays and journal articles. God damn it. What a waste of time. Perhaps reading one essay from this book per week is enough. So glad the weather is warm now.  
&#8230;  
Still, this is only a small portion of my mind; It&#8217;s merely only the passive side. It&#8217;s missing the entire creative, active portion: creating public spaces, new media political city art, tools for society, urban material ideas, and so on, for that political end of increasing the freedom for others. I&#8217;m happy that such a book exists, but such an academic organization is quite useless compared to an active social organization that continuously deals with society, and the things that come out of the process &#8212; the realization of ideas with the aforementioned political ends.

From my ebook playlist:

towards social change via geography:  
Society in Time and Space: A Geographical Perspective on Change by Robert Dodgshon  
&#8211; provides a good overview of the social change debate. The last chapter is the main social change reading, though, the history chapter looks fun too. Other chapters include how culture (and symbolization), built environment, and organization affect social change.

environmental social science:  
1.\***** [The People, Place, and Space Reader](http://peopleplacespace.org/toc/)  
&#8211; see  [this recent thought which was a reaction to the discovery of this selection of essays](#update_23-12-15), which notes the like-mindedness and importance of these essays to my mind  
&#8211; [further recommended readings](http://peopleplacespace.org/frr/), though there are enough in the introductions to each section of the book  
&#8211; [possibly affiliated programs, journals, and organizations](http://www.gc.cuny.edu/Page-Elements/Academics-Research-Centers-Initiatives/Centers-and-Institutes/Center-for-Human-Environments/Research-Sub-Groups/Public-Space-Research-Group/Affiliates-Links)  
&#8211; possible further readings from a school department affiliated with the editors: [student and faculty favorites](http://enviropsych.org/resources/readings/) of [recommended readings by CUNY environmental psychology program](https://sites.google.com/site/environmentalpsychologywiki/Home/recmmended-readings), seems like a great selection, including things like Harvey&#8217;s The Condition of Postmodernism, Life a User&#8217;s Manual, &#8220;The Child in the City&#8221;, &#8220;The Power of Maps&#8221;, Illuminations by Walter Benjamin, and &#8220;Nature&#8217;s Metropolis&#8221;!  
&#8211; Anthropology of Space and Place: Locating Culture by one of the editors of this book, is another collection

cultural theory readings:  
2.\*** culture and society: contemporary debates edited by Alexander and Seidman  
&#8211; seems like a canonical set of essays on culture from sociology, anthropology, critical theorists, Frankfurt School, etc. Easy reads. Should be able to read completely as the essays are quite popular.

natural societies:
