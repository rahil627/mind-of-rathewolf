Digital work has its limits, even the highest form of today's robots do. They can't emulate a teacher, a doctor, or a three-year old. For the most part, it only provides knowledge in the form of data.

It seems to me that there is a cognitive bias in developed societies whereby doing some digital work for good is significant in value, whether it's donating to a high level organization, funding a kickstarter campaign, giving data for earthquakes, or offering their own computer for protein synthesis. All of these forms of charity are very low in value.

I don't know how the capital from high level organizations reach low level ones, but it's probably through a lot of wasted effort.

I can only think at a community-level, and I don't quite understand why others don't. I believe, this is perhaps linked to the [home fallacy](https://mind.rathewolf.com/the-home-fallacy-or-nomadism-is-normal).

Perhaps another reason to throw everyone who lives in the suburbs of a developed country to a nearby homeless shelter, empowerment organization, or professional aid facility, or, to a developing country, and do some actual work.

The limits of Digital work also may lead to the discontent of people in the knowledge society. [needs more thought]
