> I lost my sense of adventure, enthusiasm, excitement. I just go home and sleep now. It&#8217;s fucking stupid. There&#8217;s so much to do in the world, yet I do nothing.

The idea of going home and being at home results in less action, and more likely to passively consume. This is because only one&#8217;s housemates exist in the house, and media. Only if one lived with housemates whom one wants to take action with would going home lead to more action. [Though with technology one can talk which may result in fruitful actions, it is less likely than physically being together](http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/experience-and-action). This is apparent in the suburbs, but even in the city, once one has a house, one can becomes quite lazy spending time in it.

One&#8217;s home should only be use for private time, to get away from the world.
