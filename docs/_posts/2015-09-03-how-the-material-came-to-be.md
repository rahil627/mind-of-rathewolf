[todo: just publishing drafts, really deserves more thought]

Usually thought of while traveling, especially between a developing area and a developed area. It is probably the cause of the onset of philosophic mania.

One wonders, how everything came to be.

How did all of this material accumulate. Â How did the knowledge of putting these materials together pass. Who accumulated it. Why were they chosen. Who they where chosen by.

How cities became clones of other cities. How ideas are copied. How narrow the knowledge of a society is.

How people, especially laborers, become spatially and habitually trapped.

And so on.
