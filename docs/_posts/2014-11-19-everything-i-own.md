Not including: furniture (my Dad bought them), house supplies (I bought a lot of junk, but it seems to slowly gets put to use in the house), media (discovered Voice Dream and pirate eBook library too late), some clothes that fit well, and things that will be rid of soon.

Estimate: 80 things.  
Goal: 50. Poop.

> Buy a stereo system. It&#8217;s worth it. If not, high quality headphones. Zack&#8217;s stereo system and my stereo system at home make a much larger impression for me. Ship my stereo system to SF?

EVERYTHING THAT I OWN:

sleeping bag / quilt &#8211; enlightened equipment’s Revelation (tears too easily! Already have two pieces of electrical tape repairs on it), it&#8217;s also kind of made to be used with a slepeing pad, because it&#8217;s doesn&#8217;t fully wrap around the body, which makes the mummy function quite silly for people who sleep on their side.
