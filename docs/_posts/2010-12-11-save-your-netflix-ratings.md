I have a data whoring personality. I have way to many things-to-do lists, and text files with data which can be easily found on the internet. I&#8217;m trying to move away from this, yet I still persist.

Previously, to download my Netflix Ratings I used to use a <a title="script" href="http://tenhanna.com/greasemonkey/" target="_self">script</a> in Greasemonkey, but that didn&#8217;t work this time. After some Googling, I found <a title="LikeMinds" href="http://www.likeminds.com/" target="_self">LikeMinds</a> (SaveMyRatings).

_&#8220;LikeMinds is a service for sharing your favorites and discovering new stuff; including movies, books, music, people and places, with the help of other like-minded people._

_LikeMinds also allows you to share your ratings with friends by quickly copying your ratings from different websites including Netflix, Blockbuster, Amazon, Flixster, Yahoo, IMDB, RottenTomates , iTunes, Winamp, GoodReads, Shelfari and many more websites and applications.&#8221;_

I signed up and was able to import my Netflix ratings to the LikeMinds server, but I had trouble finding how to import it to a local file. Then I found this <a title="link" href="http://app.likeminds.com/facebook/user/0/movies/ratings/export/?lmref=lm_blog" target="_self">link</a>. I had to log into Facebook for some reason, but it worked!

[<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5" title="My Netflix ratings in Excel" src="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/netflix.png" alt="" width="1007" height="868" srcset="http://rahilpatel.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/netflix.png 1007w, http://rahilpatel.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/netflix-300x258.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1007px) 100vw, 1007px" />](http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/netflix.png)

LikeMinds saves your ratings into a CSV file, which can be opened with Excel, then easily manipulated to however you like.

There were some errors. Some foreign movie titles contained weird characters. I even found a movie I can&#8217;t find on Netflix&#8211;&#8220;Wild, Wild West: The Steel Assassin&#8221; from 1999! Regardless, my storage greedy personality was satisifed.

I went even further adding friends similar to me, which resulted with a list of &#8220;movies new to you that your 19 LikeMinds rated highly&#8221;.

[<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9" title="LikeMinds" src="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/LikeMinds.png" alt="" width="998" height="870" srcset="http://rahilpatel.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/LikeMinds.png 998w, http://rahilpatel.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/LikeMinds-300x261.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 998px) 100vw, 998px" />](http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/LikeMinds.png)

This list already seemed far more useful than any recommendations I&#8217;ve received from Netflix! Now if only I rated all of my music&#8230;
