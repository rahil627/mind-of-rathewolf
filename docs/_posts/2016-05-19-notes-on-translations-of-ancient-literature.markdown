Two recent posts have been about finding a _good_, if not the _best_ translation and/or publication of ancient literature: [Dao De Jing (道德經) and Zhuangzi (莊子) ](https://mind.rathewolf.com/laozi-and-zhuangzi-translation-hell)and [Plutarch's Lives](https://mind.rathewolf.com/parallel-lives-translations). I took the notes and the lesson from those posts and placed them here.



## notes on publishers


1. **Penguin [Classics]**
- good, simple book format (which is becomes more important when reading digitally): intro, then straight to content
- most often has (/ probably can afford and copyright) the best translation
- for prolific authors they to divide works by several books often with different translators, which would make word choices inconsistent, and reading a bit more cumbersome (again, doubly important for digital reading)
2. Oxford [World's Classics]
- similar [to Penguin], but in the case of Plutarch's Lives, failed by excluding content


### Western


1. **none**
- if one doesn't like the Penguin edition, then some other random publisher may have a better publication (physical format, digital format, extra content) or translation (Hackett, Basic Books, Yale, Cambridge, etc.)
- if one wants complete works, again, some other random publisher may have it (ex. Modern Library for Aristotle and Plutarch's Lives, Hackett for Plato, Landmark for Ancient Greece historians, etc.)
*. Delphi Classics eBook
– made for digital! Translator is probably limited to those that are available for free, which could be crusty.
x. Harvard [Loeb Classical Library]
- avoid, billingual Greek and very literally translated English, made for anal academicians. Perhaps for ease of secondary translators?


### Eastern


1. **none** – probably some random native translator who is capable of thinking like an ancient native person, such as Yutang Lin and Wing-tsit Chan for ancient Chinese philosophy
- **_A Source Book in Indian Philosophy_ by Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, Charles A. Moore** (Princeton)
- **_A Source Book in Chinese Philosophy_ by Wing-tsit Chan (Rongjie Chen)** (Princeton)
-- published after helping Watson with _Sources of Chinese Tradition_ (Columbia)
- **_The Wisdom of China [and India]_ by Yutang Lin** (Random House, Modern Libary, picked it up)
-- he wrote a history of Chinese philosophy and even translates the Chinese sources, [which I thought were the best translations of Laozi _and_ Zhuangzi](https://mind.rathewolf.com/translations-of-laozi-and-zhuangzi-a-translation-hell). For the India portion, I believe he writes the history, but selects translations of sources.
- _Readings in Classical Chinese Philosophy_ by Ivanhoe and Norden (Hackett)
0.5 Columbia (Watson, Mair)
- seems like a niche monopoly here. Better than Penguin and Oxford for Laozi, and maybe Zhuangzi too (**doesn't this show how insular and analytic (read: anal) Harvard and Oxford are? And on lesser level, how insular even Columbia is for not having more, smaller societies?**)! Also has [anthologies and "source books"](https://mind.rathewolf.com/the-kinds-of-literature-and-the-extraction-of-ideas) for literature _and everything else_ respectively, which basically cover the entirety of a civilization's past:
- **[Introduction to Asian Civilizations series](http://cup.columbia.edu/series/introduction-to-asian-civilizations)**: Titles beginning with "Sourcebook" are comprehensive, "_Encompassing social, intellectual, religious, and literary traditions_"; Titles with "Sources" is an "_abridged introductory collection [that] offers students and general readers primary readings in the social, intellectual, and religious traditions_". So, **it seems that they are composed of [social, intellectual, and religious histories](https://mind.rathewolf.com/lessons-in-research-of-a-past-time). That's a huge feat. That makes this series, as far as the East goes, the most valuable source that I have found thus far.**
-- _Sourcebook of Korean Civilization:_ Volume One: From Early Times to the 16th Century by Peter H. Lee
-- _Sources of Korean Tradition:_ Volume One: From Early Times Through the 16th Century by Peter H. Lee, Yôngho Ch'oe, Hugh H. W. Kang
- Victor A. Mair is the editor of _The Columbia History of Chinese Literature_, _The Shorter Columbia Anthology of Traditional Chinese Literature _, _Columbia Anthology of Chinese Folk and Popular Literature_, and a translator of at least Laozi, Zhuangzi, and Xunzi.
- Burton Watson is _the translator_ of a ton of things all over East Asia (Hanfeizi, Xunzi, Mozi), and often a editor of the anthologies by Columbia, including one for Chinese poetry, _The Columbia Book of Chinese Poetry: From Early Times to the Thirteenth Century_, and one for Japanese poetry, _From the Country of Eight Islands: An Anthology of Japanese Poetry_.
*. Shambhala
- I ran into this publication for Laozi (3 good translations) and Zhuangzi, quite modern and good



## a recent lesson




<blockquote>**The Oxford and Harvard editions are _"scholarly"_, which for us mortals translates to _less accessible_, which opposes one of the tenets of art, making them detrimental to life. Leave those insular schools and their [publishing] presses to their insular selves. For the future: simply get the Penguin edition, if not, jump into a crusty old translation, more convenient if it's within a [reader or sourcebook](https://mind.rathewolf.com/the-kinds-of-literature-and-the-extraction-of-ideas), if not, _do something else_.**
Rahil, [Translations of Plutarch's Lives](https://mind.rathewolf.com/translations-of-parallel-lives)
