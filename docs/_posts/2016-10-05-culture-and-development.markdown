transcribed from an old sheet of paper:

travel vs efficiency (medicine, engineer, etc.)
travel vs system / organization (city, social organization)
experience vs work
  - [perhaps I meant, following culture vs working toward social and / or material organization aka development]
care for culture vs reality
->
care for culture
  - mind
  - **social reality**
  - lack intelligence / belief, story
  - The Act of Killing, cultural problems
    - **no desire, apolitical, state**
  - yet happy
  - aboriginal singing
  - **non-capitalism**
  - culture / family [end / category]

reality
  - education, resource, intelligence / skepticism, empiricism
  - fix problems, critical
    - **desire better, political, progress**
  - yet not happy
  - Kendrick Lamar
  - **capitalism?**
  - society / help all [end / category]


from another sheet of paper:
[todo: maybe to another post, toward survival-only work, do not care for culture / education, as to allow for all cultures to thrive]
next sheet:
Tainan day 1:
*brainstorm*
straight to Planett
  - thinking about south / east of Taiwan
    - development in Tainan vs development in *south / east*
      - SE being simpler, more creative, *leads to tools for survival*
        - can’t stop thinking about this, social relations with place, like tonghua, small towns, neighborhoods
        - gov, non-gov, community
      - kickstart vs find / join organization / just live there first?
    - or design?
      - vs independent art (myself)
  - only care for *survival* - engi (social, construction, software tools [personal, commercial, functional], etc.) / medicine (social health / healthcare)
    - gov vs non-gov?
    - *material infrastructure*
  x/- education / social?
    - can’t interrupt culture
     - i saw it. Their schools suck. Just give computer vs local culture.
    - *self-learning is best*
