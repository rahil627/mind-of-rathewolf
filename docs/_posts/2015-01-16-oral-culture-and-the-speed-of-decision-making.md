Talking is a creative action based on a [decision](http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/the-speed-of-decision-making "The Speed of Decision-making"). The brain pieces grammar together with words that contain ideas.

Oral culture is therefore more creative, because one is talking more and reading less. People speak books.

The life of a person in a society with oral culture is far more creative than the life of a person in a society affected by writing.

The oral person has less dogmatic knowledge, more empirical knowledge.  
&#8212;

When a society has an oral culture, propaganda cannot exist.  
&#8212;

How do judicial systems work? Are juries the law? That&#8217;s a problem, but it seems paper laws made more problems, or are ignored and not enforced altogether in the case of the US.  
&#8212;

Should education be conducted completely orally? Meaning, the teachers do not refer to texts.

Every class would be unique.

Without a foundation, would there be a problem with solidarity and nationalism?

I don&#8217;t think so.

It should always be up to the person to create a unique path of experience, then be able to communicate one&#8217;s experience to relate to another.

From [the Wikipedia article on Orality](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orality):

> In oral cultures, concepts are used in a way that minimizes abstraction, focusing to the greatest extent possible on objects and situations directly known by the speaker.

[todo: requires way more thought. This is interesting though! Slowly getting to the laziness of written cultures.]
