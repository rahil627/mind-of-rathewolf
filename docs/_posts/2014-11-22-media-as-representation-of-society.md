<blockquote>9/12/13 in Busan
The power of media is reminded as people from Mexico say that Korean drama and pop is popular. Meh, I don't care for it.</blockquote>

It's possible that person was influenced by media to see another society. Unfortunately, the pop media doesn't reflect society realistically, and then people are disappointed.

I was somewhat interested in Japan due to games I played as a child, notably, Final Fantasy. After experiencing the life of Southeast Asia, I had no interest in Japan because I felt their culture was insular. When I went, I felt I was in a land of suburbs, where people consume media. The only fantasy was that in the game. The reality was people consuming it.
