Perhaps associated with [Time and Space in Anthropology](http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/time-and-space-in-anthropology) and [The Ideal Work](http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/the-ideal-work).

notes:  
from a sheet of paper:  
live -> area problem -> *(low) work  
live -> *(high) art  
live -> love (place and people)

daydreams:  
go around Taiwan with a group  
kickstart projects together  
find room  
move to next town  
continue  
[to ideal work]

ideas:  
digital libraries  
&#8211; teach how to use e-reader, read. films. other arts.  
&#8211; in squatter spaces!  
&#8211; [vs public government buildings, such as libraries]  
&#8211; add sign, no cost  
&#8211; comfortable space as self-education  
&#8211; not education / social [? maybe meaning that the space is not social to the locality?]

from another sheet of paper:  
50 days walk, 30km/day  
France to China  
no belongings / small backpack is enough  
&#8211; no tent if enough friends  
&#8211; [hmm. I donâ€™t think this is possible. Need backpack with tent, like Patrick, then hitch.]  
no worry  
&#8211; need traveler friends, need to walk around Taiwan
