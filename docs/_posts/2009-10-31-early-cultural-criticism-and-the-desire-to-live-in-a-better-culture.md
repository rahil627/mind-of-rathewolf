> i assume that at least 50% of americans are dumb. i mean feeble, inefficient, unwilling to learn, conservative &#8211; dumb.then another 25% have bad judgement, and lost desire to learn and strive.
> 
> another 15% have bad taste and still not the best judgement.
> 
> so 5% of america is cool, 15% good, 50% tolerable.
> 
> move to japan/sweden. maybe i&#8217;ll feel like i belong there. a place where i consider 90% of people as a friend. a place where the filthy rich don&#8217;t scam the poor. only the brightest rise, but everyone else is still treated fairly. not to mention the benefits of a more social life (as opposed to american&#8217;s isolated lifestyle)

> raising a child in japan would be much easier than raising one in america. it would be a relief for the parents. the child would be surrounded by better people (better: more intelligent, better judgement, more respectful, etc.). certain culutural and familial values can be found in other countries.

> it&#8217;s okay to go to school for one thing, and choose a different career. it&#8217;s the learning that counts (or so i tell myself). the ability to learn complicated concepts, the ability to remember a vast amount of vocabulary (or syntax). most importantly to push your learning ability to the max. schools should have less busy-work and more thinking.

> recording every favorite media of yours &#8211; it&#8217;s tough in the internet age. should you do it? everything you see is temporary, and just builds on experience. it&#8217;s up to you to share for others, or for later viewing. still, i wish i kept a log of my favorite media.
