[Play the game](http://rahilpatel.com/rgbrgbrgb.html).

This is my entry [Experimental Gameplay March 2012](http://experimentalgameplay.com/blog/2012/03/economy-in-march-2012/). The theme is economy. It is the result of developing a game without thinking about the core game mechanic first. It is a complete failure.

Controls:  
Player 1/Player 2 &#8211; description

A/&#8217; &#8211; Red  
S/; &#8211; Green  
D/L &#8211; Blue  
F/K &#8211; hold and press RGB to direct military to retreat, halt, and attack  
G/J &#8211; hold and press RGB to tell workers to get a specific resource (by default it auto-gathers)

Finger mapping:  
Player 1, use right hand  
Player 2, use left hand

Player 2&#8217;s controls mirrors Player 1

A/&#8217; &#8211; index finger  
S/; &#8211; middle finger  
D/L &#8211; ring finger  
F/K &#8211; little finger  
G/J &#8211; little finger

How to play:  
It&#8217;s just a simple real-time strategy game, except you play with a keyboard. Blue units gather resources, green do nothing as of now [supposed to research/upgrade], red can attack.

Other Notes:  
As of now battles are sad due to lack of solid objects and pathfinding. Also, there is no win condition.

Post thoughts:

What was envisioned:  
1000s of units, flocking, simple yet competitive gameplay (think Hokra), precise controls (think QWOP), color-collar workers (and a statement against classism), resource renewal (and a statement against resource consumption), map based off of image, able to upload map (MS paint is now a map editor!), large resolution to zoom in and out.

Why it didn&#8217;t work:  
Decreasing the amount of player input increases the amount of AI programming. Competitive games require more balancing and tuning than non-competitive games. Multiplayer on the the same screen isn&#8217;t as fun because it lacks fog of war.

Also, I felt like crap while making this. It was forced. It just didn&#8217;t feel right.

Future:  
I feel like a game could be created with these initial ideas, but I can&#8217;t bare to look at it again.
