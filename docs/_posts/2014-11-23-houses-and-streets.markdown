<blockquote>>9/3/13
My creativity is completely gone. I'm paying for an expensive hostel without thought of work. I'm working on old things without thought. I need some inspiration.</blockquote>



Impulsivity dissipates the longer I stay inside a house. This included my parent's house, my family's house in India, and, a friendly hostel in Seoul.

It's surprising I lost impulsivity in the hostel in Seoul. But like Japan, South Korea is nearly entirely developed, with people inside buildings. Even the parks are artificial.

The more time I spend on the street, the more impulsive I am. Travel being the best. This harks Rimbaud's biography and Dean Mortiarty as extreme examples.



<blockquote>>9/3/13Cars are terrible. It's like a house on wheels.</blockquote>



When one is inside a car, one doesn't interact with the world, only with what's inside the car. The difference of a opening a window is huge.
