I&#8217;m narrow-minded. I often go in a single direction, ignoring everything else, or anything I don&#8217;t value. It&#8217;s terrible. It&#8217;s probably why I stopped being so narrow and started traveling.

People who conspicuously consume have an advantage over me. They soak in language.

I&#8217;ve met a lot of travelers who can speak several languages. Most of them learned a significant amount by watching TV shows.

I don&#8217;t watch TV shows because I don&#8217;t value my time watching them. Of course, now that I want to learn a specific language I&#8217;ll do it. Still, it sucks.

TV teaches everything one needs about language except physical practice, the act of responding. Asian people take English class for several years, memorize a lot of vocabulary and grammar, but are still unable to hold a conversation in English.

The best way to learn a language is to live in a country where they speak and place yourself in a social place everyday &#8212; a job that forces you to talk. Or, just regularly use a language exchange service to find someone to Skype with over the internet.

Another problem is that I&#8217;m indifferent to social norms and conventions, including idle conversation. I don&#8217;t say &#8220;Hello, how are you doing&#8221; to everyone. I&#8217;m concise, down to business. So even when I am in a new country, unless I&#8217;m traveling and being my extroverted happy self, I don&#8217;t really care to talk so much.

For these reasons, language is not naturally learned for me. I have to artificially learn by forcing myself to watch terrible TV shows and have valueless conversations with people, or, somehow create a meaningful experience that involves me talking to people.

Poopie.
