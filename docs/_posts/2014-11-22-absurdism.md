> It&#8217;s extremely important to choose great jobs. The highest of design. Learn languages as quick as possible. Be social. Practice. Take it seriously. Learning is key for the future. Don&#8217;t just think about the poor, do something about it!

I often experience something that evokes a strong emotional response, but don&#8217;t know how to rationally react to it, and rather want to create art out of it. Is it absurdity or ignorance?

Absurdity is hit often when I go from a developed country to a developing country, and vice versa. For some reason, [my brain takes a lot longer to make sense of society](http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/adaptation "Adaptation"), the role of technology, and just what the heck people are doing.
