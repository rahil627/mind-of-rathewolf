Continuing the thought from the [self-note from the last post](http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/in-search-of-a-past-time):

> [self-note: this was published using markdown, and is a good for testing it. The original text is in a text file in Dropbox. Can either copy the HTML from the text file using an application (Writebox) or use the WordPress markdown plugin. It seems I may have been playing with the formatting of highlights and notes, using unordered lists (via markdown), which led to some cosmetic updates to the CSS. I don&#8217;t know how to write a non-html-list in markdown using &#8220;\n- text&#8221;. I really sure hope all this messing with digital bullshit will make expressing thoughts easier during more active times in life&#8230;

It might be helpful to write down the workflow, perhaps minimizing it.

Here is my current workflow:  
1. experience  
2. think  
&#8211; non-verbal / skip to action, oral (in the mind or out loud)  
3. decide to write  
&#8211; written is a choice among infinite choices of actions  
4. express via writing to nearest material  
&#8211; paper, public computer, smartphone  
&#8211; audio recording an alternative worth considering  
if written on physical material:  
&#8211; 4.5 transcribe to digital text file  
5. publish to WordPress

Here is my current workflow with current technology:  
if using phone:  
write via a writing (likely markdown-supported) smartphone application (Writebox, Plaintext [2], Byword)  
copy text or HTML to clipboard  
paste into WordPress [web browser (because the WordPress application sucks)]  
&#8211; possibility: can purchase an update for Byword to publish to WordPress  
&#8212; this [Byword publishing feature] might be worth purchasing*  
&#8212; is it worth looking at alternative writing smartphone applications for publishing feature?: iaWriter\*, Elements: Design, nvALT and WriteRoom\*, MarsEdit, Ulysses (and Daedelus Touch), Desk [PM], Nebulous Notes. No. Stick to the simply wonderful Byword*.

if not:  
write directly via WordPress (if near / convenient; it never is convenient)  
write to a text file using Writebox  
&#8211; Writebox is multi-platform, including web browsers, making it simple to use from any personal computer. This is the closing thing to physical paper.
