<blockquote>Live on a rooftop, project a film (or just in a public space), politically vandalize, force out bad decisions â€” political / social, encourage safety and survival, ignore laws, the world is yours**, but it only feels like mine if there are people around. None of these public acts matter if no one is around. I need the city. No act is useful in a society where the acts make no sense to the community. Work is needed in less developed societies, but I desire to do higher level work. It is not satisfying to do any less (of course I can learn from anything), but it feels better to be near my full capability. - a thought from a note written in Yilan</blockquote>
