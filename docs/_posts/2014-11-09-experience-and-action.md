from an [old thought about households and inaction](http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/households-and-inaction):

> Though with technology one can talk which may result in fruitful actions, it is less likely than physically being together.

Why is the physical presence of people a stronger incentive to action than media?

This thought comes close to thoughts about public spaces and DIY spaces.

[todo: come back!]
