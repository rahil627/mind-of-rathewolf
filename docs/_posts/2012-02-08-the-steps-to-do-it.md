<blockquote>Steps in life.
Overcome body influences
Overcome time management
Overcome the system
Overcome the fear of doing
Overcome the fear of doing something large

Control body, time
Do it
Do it with integrity

Preface. The following steps are meaningless as any self help book. It is merely a gauge. To learn, you must do it yourself. A large shortcut to a lot of it is to live alone with just two bags.

Hmmm, it may be that the reason I cannot make something large is my lack of leadership. I need to overcome communication. I need to be able to choose my group and lead to success.

It would have just been easier if I had a great mentor to follow.

Post about life lessons.
