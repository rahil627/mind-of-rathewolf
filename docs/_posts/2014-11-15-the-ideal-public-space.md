8/28/15 update  
I&#8217;m hijacking this old post for a newer set of ideals.

todo: take from home page, todos / notes, and three months in Taipei

> &#8230;  
> A constant progressive education.  
> &#8230;

It is indeed nice to see New York have many forms of public spaces: [progressive schools](http://www.newschool.edu/), [DIY spaces](http://babycastles.com/), public venues, [vocational schools](http://flatironschool.com/), and [art schools not affected by wealth](http://sfpc.io/).

Why did the resurgence of vocational schools take so long? No one should spend four years to learn how to make a website. A single workshop could do that. And nearly every university fails to offer a good liberal education.

That&#8217;s what exists. Let&#8217;s go back to nothing. What is the ideal public space?

It would have the obvious characteristics:  
Everyone is welcome.  
Physically open most of the time  
Anyone can propose something.  
Easily accessible  
No underlying business directions  
No constraint in subjects*  
etc.

If a space plans to have DIY stuff, then a building is required. Otherwise, a gazebo at a park would do.

To keep it alive, there has to be someone there.

To keep it growing, there has to be events.

There is no end goal in a public space. Like a special non-evolving pokemon, it stays a public space.

If a group of people find direction, it should not influence the entire space&#8217;s direction; They are just a group of people in a space, which may do things (create projects). (Though it may help finances and grant-writing)

[todo: need to think more]  
&#8212;

*Is having no direction possible? A bunch of random mics or meetups often have no results. It will just die. Indeed a direction vs diversity problem. I&#8217;m optimistic. It has to be possible. It&#8217;s entirely up to the people to collaborate and create. It just helps if there is a constraint. But the constraint shouldn&#8217;t be on the entire space. Instead, just constrain events for creativity.

Should people do work (full-time or temporary) at public spaces? Only if they contribute to the space enough? If it&#8217;s a free space, like outdoors, then there&#8217;s no stopping them.

Spaces lack external stimuli. Perhaps meet-ups should alternate locations, or be in transit.

Possible income for spaces in buildings: food (part restaurant!), drinks (part cafe?), sleep (part dormitory? hip travel services?), merchandise, commission whenever a person is hired from the space, door charge for events.

[todo: hmmm, could use more thoughts
