Sometime after watching some videos of Super Smash Bros. Melee (SSBM, Melee), I day-dreamed of a better version of Melee. There were more varied stages that fit the magical criteria of it being accepted by the community.

Then I imagined a mew2king combo someone off-stage in jungle japes, ending in a spike into a klaptrap, which was somehow DI&#8217;d and tech-jumped, running into yet another spike into a second klaptrap.

[I also imagined settings for turning on certain stage hazards, such as randall [the cloud], shy guys, and whispy, which all gives players a chance to interrupt combos or a chance at a recovery.]

Anyway, it would all be simple if Nintendo made the game open-source. Yet, 16 years later, not even an ounce of support for the competitive scene. In it&#8217;s stead, complete disregard and continued raking of capital through outdated proprietary hardware.

Perhaps Japan&#8217;s culture doesn&#8217;t value competition as much as family fun, but, when it&#8217;s as easy to do as pressing a button, the company&#8217;s reputation, in my mind, continues to fall over time. If this were a reputable company, say, Blizzard, this opportunity would have been immediately capitalized (taken advantage of). I can&#8217;t imagine any of the game programming to be special enough to be secret, so, I see no reason why not.

With some tweaks here and there, perhaps most of the stages, characters, [, items? stage hazards?] could be playable, resulting in more life without adding complexity (more information).

The result of ignoring and avoiding that decision has wasted much human labor through [attempts to hack it](https://smashboards.com/threads/melee-hacks-and-you-new-hackers-start-here-in-the-op.247119/) and [even using a sequel to the game to replicate it](http://www.ssbwiki.com/Project_M). **So much human effort often is wasted due to simple decisions by the privileged and/or property-owners.**
