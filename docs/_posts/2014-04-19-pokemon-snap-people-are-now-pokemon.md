People use their phone cameras to find pokemon and take pictures of them.

implementation:  
Choose pokemon based on facial features or body shape or both.  
After the pokemon is identified, begin tracking the movement of it  
When the human body turns, the pokemon also turns  
Track certain parts of human to mirror skeletal movement of pokemon (arms, legs, body turn, head turning)

later possibilities:  
upload pictures to a database (in-app and website) where people can rate them for certain characteristics, awarding them with badges
