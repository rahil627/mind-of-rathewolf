is a nightmare.

There's far too many choices. Do I get a consumer camcorder, a prosumer camcorder, a DSLR with video capabilities, or a real professional film camera?  Well, the consumer camcorders have the consumer look, prosumer camcorders produce the same quality but have more buttons, DSLRs are missing features to consider it as a video camera, and a real film camera costs $7000.

A "pro" would say. Buy a real film camera. If you don't have the money but know that film is what you want to do in life, save up for a real film camera.

A smart person will tell you to film with whatever you have. If the camera is limiting your abilities, buy whatever is within your budget.

If I could turn back time I'd buy a $600 TM-900 and start shooting; Then buy things as I need them.

That didn't happen. I over-researched, spending more time reading when I could have been shooting. I ended up with a $1150 Panasonic DMC-GH2 with the 14-140mm lens. Although I don't regret my purchase I do regret the time wasted.

Hm, now I'm unsure if I should provide the research I did as it may enable a reader to continue researching.

Might be updated soon!

Even though that Panasonic was the gem of DSLR / mirror-less film-making, it sucked as a film camera. The stabilization made it impossible for any sort of recording while walking. The camera itself was large. The camera would eat up battery and memory cards.

I sold it and bought a Panasonic v750. USB-powered and steadicam-like stabilization. If only I had bought the camcorder two years ago.
