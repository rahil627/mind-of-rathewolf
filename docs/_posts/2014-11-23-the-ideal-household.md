Unlike the [neighborhood](http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/the-ideal-neighborhood "The Ideal Neighborhood"), the household doesn&#8217;t matter much.

If one is single, it could be just a small space to safely keep belongings and sleep in. If the country doesn&#8217;t provide cheap and healthy food, then there must be a kitchen.

If one has roommates, then perhaps it would have a living room that has an appearance similar to one&#8217;s dream cafe.

If one a family, then I still think it should resemble a dream cafe, with more play space.
