When going from a densely populated area to a sparsely populated one, perhaps in addition to the lack of social liveliness, a fear of solitude comes about.

Simply, if one human is having a problem, without another within vicinity, how will that person get over it?

Densely populated areas feel safe because there are more people. More people more justice.

More desolate areas allow have more space between people and less light. Both of which attract petty crimes.

Favelas are populated, yet have crimes.

Are those crimes only restricted to dark alleys and unlit pathways?

Another thought.

If one grows in a house where one is accustomed to lock the door, turn on lights at night, come home before night, never walk alone, never go out without a car, a fear to go out, and perhaps a fear to meet people ("strangers") could develop.

Another.

The lack of crime in East Asia is factor of freedom. One doesn't worry about where they are, how, or when they will get home. Sleeping outside is a viable option.

I can't say the same for America, especially suburban America, even after traveling.

I had a more positive view during my nights in New York after travel, but there's still a bit of insecurity.

When I came back to New York, I decided, out of exhaustion, convenience, and change in cost of living, to sleep in Washington Square park. There were a few bums playing music and a few drunk university kids enjoying it, both equally harmless. Later there were just drunk university kids. I believe, the bums were cleared out by the police (I've seen them clearing bums out on a different day).

Over-policing cause the bums to continually move toward other covers from wind for warmth: under bridges, in subways stations, in underpasses. An unfortunate migratory pattern.

From my experience in East Asia, I did not see this. A homeless person, and even people with homes -- a drunk university kid, and a businessman, could sleep in a public park. They appear quite alright, perhaps tired from the world, but unagitated.

[Homeless Asians are special](https://mind.rathewolf.com/homeless-asians), especially so when seen in the developed world.

Property is a concept I struggle to understand. To pay an enormous amount of money for space above earth. Does this directly derive from slave and slave-masters? Shouldn't this concept be dead in the Information Age? [todo: read Debt: The First 5000 Years]

Even after much travels, the place I fear the most is where I am now: a large house in a gated community. A whistle is useless here.
