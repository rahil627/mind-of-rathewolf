A thought after coming to my parent&#8217;s house:

> 10/6  
> Within the past few days I had these thoughts:  
> If a person grows up in a city, and isn&#8217;t completely isolated within a house, that person would have been exposed to more information, through all senses, than he would have in a controlled environment. In a controlled environment (house, class, suburbs) data is directed by educators and/or media. Growth depends entirely on the interaction of the person with other persons. And if there are no persons, then an interactive media, such as the internet.
> 
> No. There&#8217;s a lot to learn in a house, there&#8217;s just more in a city. Interactions of masses of people in the public cannot be entirely comprehended. If one has leisure time in a city, it&#8217;s quite easy to max a brain out with the sensorial input of the artificial and people.
> 
> It&#8217;s quite difficult to emulate the city experience at home, and even more difficult when one combines media and city life: simultaneously listening to headphones, talking to multiple friends on a smartphone, while on a subway. Human interaction cannot be emulated; It can only be observed. The closest practical solution to creating as much input is Veidt&#8217;s: an array of televisions, and perhaps each with it&#8217;s own audio output. And even then some of those televisions should have a person simply walking with a video camera, which no television program does.
> 
> When I arrived to my parent&#8217;s house I experienced a huge step down in the feeling of experience, and I&#8217;ve never been able to get to a city level, and sure not an Asian city levels. It&#8217;s too artificial, cold. In order for me to create I cannot be in a void, or perhaps only temporarily, like late nights at a library. But I still need a stimulus-filled normal life.

Life cannot be emulated.

The amount of sensorial information gained from a city cannot be surpassed by media unless the media is interactive, and even then, it&#8217;s quite difficult.

If one grows up in the suburbs, or in a house far from having any sort of public life, it is natural for a person to try to consume as much media as one can to simulate the city. Technology now allows people to communicate, and even then, it&#8217;s not quite the same as physically being in proximity.
