[I think this was written directly to the blog, not from my thoughts file, perhaps written soon after coming home, in the suburbs]

> &#8220;He who is unable to live in society, or who has no need because he is sufficient for himself, must be either a beast or a god.&#8221; &#8211; Aristotle

Or socially die.

> &#8220;That to study philosophy is nothing but to prepare one&#8217;s self to die.&#8221; &#8211; Cicero

When a person is socially detached from nuclear family and institutions in a suburban or similar environment, the person has no other society to be part of.

The city is a society, which may be viewed as the form of a institution or family.
