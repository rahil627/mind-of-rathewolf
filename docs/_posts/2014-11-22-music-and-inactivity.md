> >9/3/13Music is what kept me working. I&#8217;m unsure if its good or bad. I was happy working in both San Francisco and New York despite a very unsocial life, but I could have done so much more with people.

During high school, college, and my first two jobs, I used music as an aid to do work.

This is wrong. One should constantly think (talking to oneself inside one&#8217;s head) and/or consume, to stimulate brain, and increase chance for reaction.

It&#8217;s quite easy to simultaneously work and think of something completely different. For my last gig, I was programming while listening to lectures, paying no attention to my work.

I am unsure whether I should consider myself during those years as a human or slave. Music could be a powerful tool for slave-masters.
