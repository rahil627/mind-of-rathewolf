from an [old thought about households and inaction](https://mind.rathewolf.com/households-and-inaction):


<blockquote>Though with technology one can talk which may result in fruitful actions, it is less likely than physically being together.</blockquote>



Why is the physical presence of people a stronger incentive to action than media?

This thought comes close to thoughts about public spaces and DIY spaces.

[todo: come back!]
