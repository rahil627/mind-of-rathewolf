note: I'm just starting this! Hold on.

I've been admitted to Parson's The New School for Design's Design and Technology program.

And I feel it is important to think about the following:

1. What do you want to do at Parson’s? (see my statement of interests and intentions I sent to Parson's, NYU game design, and NYU ITP)
  - write ideas, clearly, with purpose, and prioritize them to find the most meaningful one
  - propose (idea or ideas?) to audience at Parson’s once I get there

2. Summarize what experiences imparted some philosophy in games
  - <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/a-sequential-list-of-times-game-related-experiences-that-affected-me" title="A Sequential List of Times Game-related Experiences that Affected Me">list games and experiences</a>
  - create own manifesto
  - see philosophy's of great game designers
  - see old notes and thoughts I wrote

Life related questions:
3. Is attending Parson's necessary? Is being in New York necessary? Can I do this on my own outside of a city? Should the money go into business instead? Can $18,000 buy a tea shop in Taiwan? Can I live without much social life?
