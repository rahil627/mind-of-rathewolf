note: I&#8217;m just starting this! Hold on.

I&#8217;ve been admitted to Parson&#8217;s The New School for Design&#8217;s Design and Technology program.

And I feel it is important to think about the following:

1. What do you want to do at Parson’s? (see my statement of interests and intentions I sent to Parson&#8217;s, NYU game design, and NYU ITP)  
&#8211; write ideas, clearly, with purpose, and prioritize them to find the most meaningful one  
&#8211; propose (idea or ideas?) to audience at Parson’s once I get there

2. Summarize what experiences imparted some philosophy in games  
&#8211; [list games and experiences](http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/a-sequential-list-of-times-game-related-experiences-that-affected-me "A Sequential List of Times Game-related Experiences that Affected Me")  
&#8211; create own manifesto  
&#8211; see philosophy&#8217;s of great game designers  
&#8211; see old notes and thoughts I wrote

Life related questions:  
3. Is attending Parson&#8217;s necessary? Is being in New York necessary? Can I do this on my own outside of a city? Should the money go into business instead? Can $18,000 buy a tea shop in Taiwan? Can I live without much social life?
