<blockquote>9/12/13 in Busan<br />
No school makes sense. Go by pure motivation. Fuck anything else.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Dont let anyone take you in the wrong direction. You don't have to spend time learning chinese with classmates if it doesn't motivate you. Learn it in your own way. It's more fun, more serious, much more interesting, in my view. See the beauty in the world.</p></blockquote>
