## <span id="notes_on_the_translations_of_plutarch8217s_lives">notes on the translations of Plutarch&#8217;s Lives</span>

1. Penguin [Classics]  
&#8211; mostly translated by Ian Scott-Kilvert  
&#8211; 6 books (about 8 lives each), **complete**  
&#8211; book format: ?  
&#8211; not available on Library Genesis, but it seems there are [torrents](http://smart-torrents.com/plutarch-greek-roman-lives-essays-tf4037020.html), too bad I don&#8217;t have my laptop with me at the moment!  
&#8211; **I&#8217;m guessing this is the best edition.**

2. Modern Library [Classics]  
&#8211; translated by John Dryden (**1683**!), edited by Arthur Hugh Clough (**1872**!). Though dated, from the little bit I read, it read just fine, on par with Perrin&#8217;s translation &#8212; an accurate translation. I would have to read more. Scholars advise to avoid Dryden, but I might actually prefer this over the scholarly ones.  
&#8211; just 2 volumes! **complete**!  
&#8211; **until I get the Penguin series, [this epic one volume eBook](https://archive.org/details/livesofnoblegrec00plutiala) is the best choice**, they took the time to digitize it perfectly.  
&#8211; **the introduction, a biography of Plutarch, is a feat in scholarship**, whereas Bernadotte is merely a one page intro

3. Oxford [World Classics]  
&#8211; translated by Robin Waterfield, and it&#8217;s amazing, super readable, little punctuation  
&#8211; 3 books: Greek Lives (9), Roman Lives (8-9, contains Gracchuses), Hellenisitic Lives (?, published this year, 2016), **incomplete as of now**  
&#8211; book format: for each life: introduction (by Philip A. Stadter), introduction sources cited (why!?), then Plutarch&#8217;s content. **It is missing Plutarch&#8217;s comparison essays!** At the end of the book there are notes, proper names, textual notes, etc.  
&#8211; available via [Library Genesis](https://sites.google.com/site/themetalibrary/library-genesis)

3. Harvard [Loeb Classical Library]  
&#8211; translated by Bernadotte Perrin, and it&#8217;s a little less readable than Waterfield, with far more punctuation marks, but perfectly fine and modern  
&#8211; 11 volumes: two to three pairs each, **complete**  
&#8211; for $3, Delphi Classics seems specialize in eBook, and in this case, has [one for Plutarch](https://www.delphiclassics.com/shop/plutarch/), which contains the entire Parallel Lives and Moralia, both using Perrin&#8217;s translations, but I believe it keeps the Greek-English parallel format  
&#8211; book format is rough for eBook readers as it is parallel text Greek and English. The eBook reader must have a landscape double page function, or else reading is impossible.  
&#8211; [available entirely on the Internet Archive](https://archive.org/search.php?query=creator%3A%22Perrin%2C%20Bernadotte%22%20lives)  
&#8211; [LacusCurtius](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/home.html) ([Penelope.uChicago.edu](http://Penelope.uChicago.edu){.autohyperlink}), &#8220;_A site for teaching yourself to read Latin inscriptions._&#8220;, contains most texts from Loeb, in English, single page HTML, all content maintained neatly, with links to Perrin&#8217;s notes and the author of the site, Thayer&#8217;s notes  
&#8211; this would make it a better option than Oxford&#8217;s eBook for reading via eBook reader, but one would have to save them all as html (DownThemAll! Firefox plugin equivalent for Chrome?) then combine them in the correct order. I&#8217;ll wait until I get my laptop and get the Penguin edition.  
&#8211; [The Perseus Project](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/collection) ([www.Perseus.Tufts.edu](http://www.Perseus.Tufts.edu){.autohyperlink}) seems to separate html pages by each live and each section making it entirely unreadable (what is the point of doing this?). I&#8217;m not sure if there&#8217;s a way to view or download things in their entirety.

**The Oxford and Harvard editions are _&#8220;scholarly&#8221;_, which for us mortals translates to _less accessible_, which opposes one of the tenets of art, making them detrimental to life. Leave those insular schools and their [publishing] presses to their insular selves. For the future: simply get the Penguin edition, if not, jump into a crusty old translation, more convenient if it&#8217;s within a [reader or sourcebook](http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/the-kinds-of-literature-and-the-extraction-of-ideas), if not, _do something else_.**

## <span id="other_ancient_greek_or_roman_biographers">other Ancient Greek or Roman biographers</span>

**Suetonius &#8211; Twelve Caesars  
&#8211; published by Penguin** and Oxford  
&#8211; **seems like the perfect Roman primary source companion to Parallel Lives**  
Diogenes Laertius &#8211; Lives of Eminent Philosophers  
&#8211; published by Cambridge, perhaps it&#8217;s not plagued by _&#8220;scholarship&#8221;_  
Philostratus &#8211; Lives of the Sophists  
&#8211; solely published by Harvard [Loeb Classical Library]?  
&#8211; digressing: [**The Social World of Intellectuals in the Roman Empire**](http://www.cambridge.org/do/academic/subjects/classical-studies/ancient-history/social-world-intellectuals-roman-empire-sophists-philosophers-and-christians). \*drool\*. Need this for Ancient Greece.  
Eunapius &#8211; Lives of Philosophers and Sophists  
&#8211; contained in the second half of that Harvard publication of Philostratus  
&#8211; All of the modern translations of these biographers are unfortunately available from Harvard [Loeb Classical Library]. There are older translations available on the Internet Archive, and some newer translations as mentioned, but I&#8217;d rather _do something else_. Perhaps in the future Penguin may deem them worthy enough for the common people.
