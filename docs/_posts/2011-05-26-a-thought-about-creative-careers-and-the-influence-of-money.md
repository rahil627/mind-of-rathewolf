Figured I should post something as I will be job hunting soon and my website is listed in my resume!

Like any techie, this domain is reserved for my personal use. Of course I wanted to design a cool website for myself but it just isn&#8217;t a priority. Which leads to what&#8217;s currently on my mind.

I had a thought about me trying to explain why there is such a small amount of creative companies that I&#8217;d want to work for. It started with an example and went from there.

Dreamworks is making Shrek X because upper management know it will make money no matter what the quality of the end result is. The original Shrek was a huge success, so marketing capitalized on it and turned it into a franchise. This limits the creativity of the team, probably forcing the auteur to quit because of it. Upper management probably makes rough deadlines&#8211;one Shrek movie per year. The company is now crap. Just like that.

Well okay, Kung Fu Panda 2 seemed to fare well with the critics. I haven&#8217;t seen it.

Anyhow, this deterioration occurs to companies in every creative/entertainment industry. The music used in Shrek X are from popular artists because the public can recognize it, resulting in a more accessible product that is easier to market. Shrek X the video game is handed off to some game studio, restricting creativity, limiting quality due to a short deadline, resulting in more crap.

Only a handful of quality companies become large and successful companies&#8211;Pixar, Apple, Blizzard. So that leaves a few large companies and striving independent studios that favor quality over money.

I want to find a job within one of these companies, make a steady paycheck in a stress free work environment where I can cherish my work, &#8217;cause working hard for something I&#8217;m not proud of is dissatisfying. After securing a job, I could then use my free time to work on other aspirations&#8211;music and film&#8211;to make something of my own. Possibly create my own company, or with friends. Personally invest in myself, or pray for an angel investor. Is this the only path in such a money-whoring world? Maybe I should just forget money completely. Become a traveling artist, a bum in most&#8217;s eyes. Oh right, then I can&#8217;t support a family. Hmm&#8230; Yup, that&#8217;s the only path I can currently think of. The only path without selling my soul.
