[Play the game](http://www.rahilpatel.com/the_jack_of_all_trades.html).

This game is my submission for the Experimental Gameplay Project. The theme is <a href = http://experimentalgameplay.com/blog/2011/09/story-game-in-september-2011/>story game.</a>

It is the first game I&#8217;ve ever created. It took most of the 7 unemployed days to complete. I did not use a game engine, hence the prevalence of bugs. I learned and used ActionScript. Special thanks to the developers of <a href = http://www.flashdevelop.org/wikidocs/index.php?title=Main_Page>FlashDevelop</a>. Without it, I would have given up.

The game involves thoughts and experiences I&#8217;ve gone through recently. Mostly about finding yourself in a capitalist world. Although looking at the end product, the story seems like an overdone trope, something that belongs to the cheap clones theme. Still, I hope it resonates something within the player.

Hint: Look for your heart, not the golden trophy. (although I shouldn&#8217;t have to give a hint, I feel my level design is bad)

EDIT: &#8230;And the [results](http://experimentalgameplay.com/blog/2011/09/story-game-roundup/) are in!
