Perhaps associated with [Time and Space in Anthropology](https://mind.rathewolf.com/time-and-space-in-anthropology) and [The Ideal Work](https://mind.rathewolf.com/the-ideal-work).

notes:
from a sheet of paper:
live -> area problem -> *(low) work
live -> *(high) art
live -> love (place and people)

daydreams:
go around Taiwan with a group
kickstart projects together
find room
move to next town
continue
[to ideal work]

ideas:
digital libraries
  - teach how to use e-reader, read. films. other arts.
  - in squatter spaces!
    - [vs public government buildings, such as libraries]
    - add sign, no cost
  - comfortable space as self-education
    - not education / social [? maybe meaning that the space is not social to the locality?]

from another sheet of paper:
50 days walk, 30km/day
France to China
no belongings / small backpack is enough
  - no tent if enough friends
  - [hmm. I donâ€™t think this is possible. Need backpack with tent, like Patrick, then hitch.]
no worry
  - need traveler friends, need to walk around Taiwan
