This was inspired by the first week's Creativity and Computation class's lecture by Sven Travis.

A neat way design new media (which may be in the form of a game) is to think of the input and the output, based on the perceptions of humans.

I used this strategy in the past for games, where I'd think about all of the inputs the medium has, often an iPad, then create games using them. However, it only dawned to me during the lecture that data is not limited to mediums. Everything is data. In and out.

Personal designs:



	
  * Track the motion ofÂ a falcon, whenever it swoops for an attack, output a "falcon punch" sound through a speaker in the public.

	
  * When a sentence with the word love or hate is said on a social platform, have a speaker in the public output the sentence.

	
  * Track rats over time, post the results in the form of a transportation transparency and paste it over a transportation map.

	
  * Put a camera on a bum, output the video in a public square.

	
  * Each time someone e-mails a government official a letter to appeal something, trigger a catapult to throw a ball of sand approximately at the official's office window.

	
  * Each time a human dies from the fault of government, trigger a mechanism to splash blood on the White House.
