> In single chapter of Invisible Cities by Italo Calvino, I feel satisfied. I consumed enough to trigger my brain to begin contemplating, creating, mixing in with my own thoughts. The power of literature is not in detail, but in imagination.

> If imagination is not the goal, I still feel conciseness is powerful. In Francis Bacon&#8217;s Essays, more about ethics is told in few words. Likewise in Borjes&#8217;s Ficciones, the stories are told only to display its mechanics; Although, even Borjes wastes space and uses many references.

Films replaced most of literature. Though, they are different experiences.

I wonder, what&#8217;s left of literature? And by literature, I mean fiction.

It seems the only pieces of literature I have are those that are fantastic [magic realism], thought-provoking, and perhaps philosophic.

I guess I will have to wait until I actually try reading some more.
