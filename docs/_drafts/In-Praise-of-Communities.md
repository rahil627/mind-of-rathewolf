After leaving the 'burbs. I've lived in two Chinatowns in San Francisco, Clinton Hill in New York, near Tonghua night market in Taipei, and for shorter periods of times: an independent school in ZhongLi, Taiwan; a hostel in Penang, Malaysia; a hostel in Bangkok, Thailand; my parents house in Vadodara, India; a hostel in Bhaktapur, Nepal; and a hostel in Seoul, Korea.
