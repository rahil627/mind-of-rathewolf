[todo: this post was thought after thinking about a good girl I recently had good conversations with, which reminded me of all the other great-valued women I&#8217;ve met in my life, and perhaps imparted in me some values, or at least, served as an ideally good person. I then thought about writing to the girls that affected me much, especially to the girls that affected me but do not know.]

people:  
find the text file which includes influential people / models:

motherly:  
Mom  
Dollyben  
Shila

sisterly:  
Sheetal

female friends:  
Sarah* [summer classmate, VA]  
Kate\[*\] \[ODU classmate, VA\]  
Molly & Andrea [roommates, SF]  
Jen\[\*] & Lauren & Ida[\*\] \[BC, NY\]  
Rice [JV&#8217;s Hostel, Taipei, Taiwan]  
Mandy* [DaDa School, Zhongli, Taiwan]  
?* [kArts, Seoul, Korea]  
Kim\[*\] \[The Warehouse, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia\]  
couple [Kimchee hostel, Seoul, Korea]  
Vee [hostel, Chiang Mai, Thailand]  
Sheila and Harshita [hostel, Darjeeling, India]  
Rice (again) & Ann [JV&#8217;s Hostel and apartment, Taipei, Taiwan]  
Kumiko\* & Minyoung\[\*\] \[CCU Chinese class, Taipei, Taiwan\]  
Emily [roomate in Songshan apartment, Taipei, Taiwan]  
Pig* [Yilan, Taiwan]

* denotes an attraction possibly existed beyond good friendship  
[*] denotes an attraction that I did not pursue  
others are likely familial (sisterly, motherly)

older:  
Qing (and John)  
Kate  
couple [hostel, Mae Sot]  
Vanessa  
? & ? [CCU Chinese class teacher and older Korean classmate]  
&#8212;

I should write to each of them, and what values they imparted in me.  
&#8212;

There was also a thought about my asexual life, and writing a bit about that.  
&#8212;  
&#8212;

In comparison, I think, there are fewer males that have imparted such values. Often, the males that have imparted some value in me are the partners of the females. I begin contact with the women and later become friends with the male, and also share a kind of homogamy (John).

Perhaps it is because my male friends have imparted values that are more instrumental. They are friends of shared interests rather than shared values.
