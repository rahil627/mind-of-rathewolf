[1/4 todo: A thought from a conversation with someone:

I think this post was intended to be about how Taiwanese people tend to be more anarchic: desire freedom, pure creativity, appearing to have a simple life but in reality having a very complex one (in their thoughts)

&#8230;perhaps restricted to take action by the social system (social norms) and economic system (capitalism) and the lack of money]
