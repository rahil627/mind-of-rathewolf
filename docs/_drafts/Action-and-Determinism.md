The logic of inclusion and exclusion via institutionalized orderings is also  
followed by those who discuss space as a ‘product’ of societal interaction/structures,  
examining the production of social inequity through spatial relations in  
the empirical cases of virtual spaces (Featherstone and Burrows, 1995; Budke  
et al., 2004), global spaces (King, 1990; Chattopadhyay, 2005; Berking et al.,  
2006), and local spaces (Mayerfeld Bell, 1997). Space is accordingly a category  
with which the social sciences address inclusion/exclusion as a problem of simultaneous  
positioning, focusing not only on the symbolic dimension of the world  
but also on the material dimension. There is broad agreement in social-scientific  
spatial studies that space is a relational category; in other words, space arises from  
the activity of experiencing objects as relating to one another (Soja, 1989; Rose,  
1999; Crang andThrift, 2000; Sturm, 2000; Adams et al., 2001). Always keeping  
in mind the dangers of arguing in deterministic terms, discovering whether space  
constructed in this manner itself structures action remains a complicated problem  
for the social scientist. While it cannot be often enough stressed that no space  
imposes specific action (pedestrian tunnels need not necessarily engender fear,  
however empirically frequently this occurs), highly elaborated know-how has  
been developed about how deliberately to generate atmospheres in spaces (see  
also Thrift, 2004). This article attempts to show that structure-theoretical arguments  
tend to take account of the power of spaces to provoke social events,  
whereas action theory tends to conceptualize space more strongly as a result of or  
context for action. Materialist theory has always proceeded on the assumption  
that societal structures shape action in specific ways. To assume in analogy that

spatial structures affect bodies is theoretically plausible and seems unproblematic  
because the subject of analysis is usually very abstract, as when Lefèbvre (1991)  
and Harvey (1990) stress that the capitalist spatial order is conducive to fragmentation.  
The closer social-scientific studies of space come to ‘micro-sociological’  
contexts, the more frequently space is ‘immobilized’ as context or locale (see  
Giddens, 1984; Werlen, 2000).
