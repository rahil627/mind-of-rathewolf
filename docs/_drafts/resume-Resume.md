Herro. I'm **Rahil Patel**, and this is the thing I throw at people when they ask for a resume or CV. I tried to limit it to experiences that should generate wealth in a capitalistic society and whose length is at least one month. My portfolio at **[rahilpatel.com](http://rahilpatel.com){.autohyperlink}** goes beyond that institutional boundary. You can call me at **757-630-7972**, or email me at **<rahil627@gmail.com>{.autohyperlink}**.

## <span id="references">References</span>

References I've recently used for school applications are Peter and Kim. Peter is also a nomad and as of 4/8/2016 successfully [Kickstarted his life's project](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/peterpanin/peter-pan-in-the-world?ref=email). I'm actually not sure if he has a phone number, so it's best to email him at <therocstone@gmail.com>{.autohyperlink}, or [through his Facebook](https://m.facebook.com/JuliusCesar). Kim is someone I met in Kuala Lumpur along with many other human-loving students at an open mic event. She works at a human rights organization, in particular advocating sex worker rights, in Penang, Malaysia. It's best to reach her through her email at <kimmkhaira@gmail.com>{.autohyperlink}. But please don't bother her much; she's really busy.

### <span id="chaiwallah_in_luodong_taiwan">Chaiwallah in 羅東 (Luodong), 臺灣 (Taiwan)</span>

from August to September 2015  
I created a chai stall and sold chai at local night markets. A very simple and interesting idea in my mind, but quite a lot of work in reality, especially because I was coming from a more philosophical, theoretical mode of life. Still, very cool to be able to run a material business with very little startup cost. Very uncool for the people who do this to make a living.

### <span id="independent_philosopher">Independent Philosopher?</span>

beginning from at least March 2014  
[Exception: This doesn't generate wealth, but I feel I spent enough time to warrant listing it here]  
After a long period of travel and using another human language, I happened to stumble upon the Western philosophy section of a library, and then I attempted to write everything that I knew. All of my philosophy is available through my portfolio. [I was at home helping my Dad's motel during the time.]

### <span id="designer_cat_and_programmer_cat_at_catlard_in_gaoxiong_taiwan">Designer Cat and Programmer Cat at Catlard in 高雄 (Gaoxiong), 臺灣 (Taiwan)</span>

from May to July 2014  
I co-designed and co-programmed an augmented reality application with Simon (Catlard) for a very uncreative contracter. I don't know how Simon tolerated me at during my travel-high, but it brought back some fond memories of childhood game culture and New York game-making culture, which was lacking during the previous year of life.

### <span id="tutor_in_taipei_taiwan">Tutor in 臺北 (Taipei), 臺灣 (Taiwan)</span>

from February to May 2014  
I tutored anything to friend's friends. This decision may simply have been the result of personal survival in a capitalistic society in which one-on-one education is highly-valued. A pretty good out!

### <span id="exchange_worker_slave_in_property">Exchange Worker (Slave) in Property</span>

beginning from February 2014  
While living nomadically, I sometimes exchange a few hours of work for free accommodation and a bit of cash for food. This includes: friends, CouchSurfing hosts, social organizations, NGOs, and wherever else I happen to sleep in. Notable NGOs include: a small health clinic for refugees near the Burmese border in Thailand, a human (sex worker) rights advocation organization in Penang, Malaysia, and a volunteer organization that builds houses for aboriginals in Taiwan. Sometimes, just a little creativity is enough for exchange. Applying the gift economy is more cumbersome than capitalism, but less repetitive.

### <span id="volunteer_at_dada_school_in_zhongli_taiwan">Volunteer at 達達美語補習班 (Dada School) in 中壢 (ZhongLi), 台湾 (Taiwan)</span>

from August to September 2012  
This was my first gig during travel. One of the things I wanted to do while traveling was to try things that I value more than private sector work, in this case, teaching and managing a daycare.

It was a work exchange at an independent school run by a fantastic couple: John and Ching. I assisted in teaching kids English by creating activities for younger students and having conversation with elder students. I also did general work: house chores, cooking, and babysitting. It felt like living with a great family rather than working. I wish I did more. Perhaps it was the heat (no air conditioner), or the mosquitoes at night, or Ching's delicious food that hindered me. Still, I managed to stay until my visa nearly ran out.

from January to February 2012  
Ahhh my first love. Amazing people doing amazing things. It was specifically what I was interested in, but had no idea a community for it existed. It was what I was looking for all along. At the time I was just beginning to create things myself (game prototypes), figuring out what games are, what it means to be an artist, and really delve into fine arts. The things these people accomplished on a daily basis was unbelievable. I merely helped setup and facilitate art game installations, and helped (or worsened) with organizational development. I regret leaving New York because of these people, and I will come back, despite disliking the city.

The organization taught me everything: the possibilities of games, the possibilities of new media, social organizations for art and for social justice, event organization, income models to run such an organization, and the infinite possibilities with social relationships within the City.

from January to February 2012  
"Interning" with Zack. I "assisted with a film shoot in the freezing cold and researched stereoscopy in film and games", though in reality, I biked through a Jewish community to get to Zack's place, ate delicious local pizza, and hung out at his apartment. Zack's an ambitious fellow on the edge of technology with an eye of a child.

### <span id="independent_gamemaker">Independent Gamemaker</span>

beginning from September 2011  
I began making games, using Experimental Gameplay Project as a deadline. After many finished an unfinished prototypes, game jams, and collaborations, I eventually helped my friends in New York create Crystal Brawl, a local multiplayer sports game. Unfortunately, one other game remains unfinished: Pinkies Up, a local multiplayer multi-touch multi-iPad game. I imagine game-making will be always be a part of my life. More detail in my portfolio.

### <span id="qa_and_release_engineer_at_perfect_world_entertainment_in_foster_city_ca">QA and Release Engineer at Perfect World Entertainment in Foster City, CA</span>

from February to May 2011  
From suburb to city, I picked up a new job too quickly, perhaps afraid of financial risk. I oversaw day-to-day tasks for the engineering department. The department creates and manages websites (and web servers) for a bunch of shitty Asian MMORPGs. It was a cumbersome process in a large company. Unrealistic goals, overtime, hasty testing, shoving out _milestones_; The stereotyped horrifically inefficient software company. I knew and warned that I was going to leave within the first week, but I stuck to the job because I was still absorbing the experience of living in a city, and a pretty good one too (San Francisco). I tried to help the company as much as I could but I came to the conclusion that my slightly more ideal values were meaningless in a large company, and my desire for something more meaningful, or at least more meaningful than managing websites for terribly bland MMORPGs, made me leave.

### <span id="software_developer_at_segin_systems_in_virginia_beach_va">Software Developer at Segin Systems in Virginia Beach, VA</span>

from February to October 2010  
My first "professional" job. I developed code for their flagship web based real estate software. Most of the time was spent implementing interfaces to scrape data from ancient third party title software databases to be sent via web services. The rest of the time was spent extending the superbly coded web site, written by the lead developer who made fine use of the then current .NET framework. An amazing, even ideal, first programming job, as there were only two other developers, and most of the time was spent programming. I knew I was going to leave my hometown, but I thought it was best to have a little "experience" before doing so.

### <span id="bachelor_of_science_in_computer_science_at_old_dominion_university_in_norfolk_va">Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at Old Dominion University in Norfolk, VA</span>

from 2005 to 2009  
I didn't perform well. I think I just needed to get out of my parent's house, or a break after high school to allow myself to take self-directed action. I did, however, value the time I watched neorealism films (thanks to Netflix technology), listened to indie music (thanks to Napster technology) and spent with my friends, often playing games competitively.

### <span id="assistant_of_the_manager_at_laquinta_inn_suites_in_norfolk_va">Assistant of the Manager at LaQuinta Inn & Suites in Norfolk, VA</span>

summer of 2008  
This is my dad's second hospitality business. Franchises have so many rules; It makes having fun impossible.

### <span id="temporary_manager_at_village_motel_in_chesapeake_va">Temporary Manager at Village Motel in Chesapeake, VA</span>

beginning from 2003  
This is my Dad's motel. It takes a surprising amount of civil engineering and hackery to maintain motels.
