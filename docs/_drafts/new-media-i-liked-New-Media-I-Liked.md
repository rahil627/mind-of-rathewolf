[meh, can do later. Should fill up as going through thoughts.]

a thought from Japan:

> At NTT ICC: Audio tapes slowly unwinds slowly above a beautiful pillar, when the unwinding ends, it winds and plays, revealing the audio track, and the fact that sound was playing the entire time. A very Braid feel. 

I found [it](http://www.ntticc.or.jp/Archive/2013/Openspace2013/Works/Toki_Ori_Ori_Nasu_ver_2.html) on the internet!
