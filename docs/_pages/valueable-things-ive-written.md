[todo: rename philosophy to filosophy. Will it break anchors?]







This post started as a tool for gauging direction using past thoughts, but with some organization (to the discontent of Wordpress's organization), it now resembles a philosophical corpus of a child.







The asterisks (*) have nothing to do with the quality of the content or even the content of the post, rather, it is the importance of the idea to me, as a way of gauging future directions, spaces to explore, [spaces] worth exploring.







original post:  
These are posts I felt either are aiming at ideals, are ongoing, or are worth thinking about some more, or pursuing. Nearly all of them were written during a period of isolation after a period of travel.

### Final Philosophy I







(posts between 2014/03/23 - 2014/8/3):  
- in retrospect, because I was trying to write while thinking fast, the writings lack vocabulary or use other words to encompass other meanings. I think much of the content is still good, if not better, because they are a closer reflection of my experiences -- in the duration of time between experience and thought (and writing), and in the distance between sensory experience and rationalizing.  
- from [An Attempt to Write Everything I Know](https://mind.rathewolf.com/an-attempt-to-write-everything-i-know) and then on, I began writing some, blogging some, using and quoting my thoughts file to gain topics from very recent personal experiences, surprisingly similar to Montaigne. My thoughts file is endless, and it may be impossible to philosophize all of my experiences, but, for the time, I tried.

## thoughts about this post







Update:  
Over time, this page has been quite useful in gauging importance and directing thought, so I organized it a little more, and added it to the top menu. It probably totally subverts the utility of Wordpress's organization, but it's all I've got as of now!







[todo: should really clean this up, clean and finish all drafts, continue using my thoughts files to extract personal ideas and build on them.]







Update:  
I ended up organizing nearly everything I've blogged! Hurray! It's not nearly as exhaustive as my thoughts.txt, but, the hope is, the things I wrote were things that I thought were, at least at the moment of blogging, important.







This layout turns out to work really well. I can easily read old writings, remember what I was thinking of, and if I want, etch the thought out further. It also makes it easier to organize, for example, an earlier post titled the The Home Fallacy, clearly has ideas of autonomous ideals. It's also fun just to play around with it, like a book, skipping to chapters, getting ideas, and creating new paths.







## This has indeed slowly become my philosophical corpus.







Update:  
But let's hope I don't spend much time here.







Hmm, can this organization further be automated, so that while I'm outside, using my phone to write thoughts directly here, I will never need to sit down and organize again? Wordpress's organization is indeed terrible. Over time, I've nearly created an outline of knowledge in the Wordpress's categories. It's useless. I guess the list of posts by date is all I've got. It sure sucks not being able to generate a list of posts, then edit it, say, adding *'s. I think it's okay to separate [writings by] periods of time, but perhaps I should avoid re-ordering them by categories.







[todo: rename philosophy to filosophy. Will it break anchors?]







This post started as a tool for gauging direction using past thoughts, but with some organization (to the discontent of Wordpress's organization), it now resembles a philosophical corpus of a child.







The asterisks (*) have nothing to do with the quality of the content or even the content of the post, rather, it is the importance of the idea to me, as a way of gauging future directions, spaces to explore, [spaces] worth exploring.







original post:  
These are posts I felt either are aiming at ideals, are ongoing, or are worth thinking about some more, or pursuing. Nearly all of them were written during a period of isolation after a period of travel.

### Final Philosophy I







(posts between 2014/03/23 - 2014/8/3):  
- in retrospect, because I was trying to write while thinking fast, the writings lack vocabulary or use other words to encompass other meanings. I think much of the content is still good, if not better, because they are a closer reflection of my experiences -- in the duration of time between experience and thought (and writing), and in the distance between sensory experience and rationalizing.  
- from [An Attempt to Write Everything I Know](https://mind.rathewolf.com/an-attempt-to-write-everything-i-know) and then on, I began writing some, blogging some, using and quoting my thoughts file to gain topics from very recent personal experiences, surprisingly similar to Montaigne. My thoughts file is endless, and it may be impossible to philosophize all of my experiences, but, for the time, I tried.

## thoughts about this post







Update:  
Over time, this page has been quite useful in gauging importance and directing thought, so I organized it a little more, and added it to the top menu. It probably totally subverts the utility of Wordpress's organization, but it's all I've got as of now!







[todo: should really clean this up, clean and finish all drafts, continue using my thoughts files to extract personal ideas and build on them.]







Update:  
I ended up organizing nearly everything I've blogged! Hurray! It's not nearly as exhaustive as my thoughts.txt, but, the hope is, the things I wrote were things that I thought were, at least at the moment of blogging, important.







This layout turns out to work really well. I can easily read old writings, remember what I was thinking of, and if I want, etch the thought out further. It also makes it easier to organize, for example, an earlier post titled the The Home Fallacy, clearly has ideas of autonomous ideals. It's also fun just to play around with it, like a book, skipping to chapters, getting ideas, and creating new paths.







## This has indeed slowly become my philosophical corpus.







Update:  
But let's hope I don't spend much time here.







Hmm, can this organization further be automated, so that while I'm outside, using my phone to write thoughts directly here, I will never need to sit down and organize again? Wordpress's organization is indeed terrible. Over time, I've nearly created an outline of knowledge in the Wordpress's categories. It's useless. I guess the list of posts by date is all I've got. It sure sucks not being able to generate a list of posts, then edit it, say, adding *'s. I think it's okay to separate [writings by] periods of time, but perhaps I should avoid re-ordering them by categories.







## Yeah, **forget the organization of words, stick to the organization of people (and material)!**
