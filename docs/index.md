<!-- yo -->

*this* is the new digital space for my mind!

you might still be able to spot [my old site](https://www.rahilpatel.com) amongst the wild internets

this site is a digital form of of my philosophies: my mind. It started as a blog which was a sorta philosophical diary intended for the public, that i started when i was 15

i have philosopher personality, and sometimes i express myself through writing, creating a life-long philosophical diary

i have my own unique thoughts, ideas, concepts. Those concepts build up to make my own language, or at least patterns: "a pattern language". Anyway, it's worth keeping my own view of the world in tact

perhaps [this copy](/herro) of my old home-page is a good start to the journey into my mind..? *whoaaa*
