Two recent posts have been about finding a <em>good</em>, if not the <em>best</em> translation and/or publication of ancient literature: <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/laozi-and-zhuangzi-translation-hell">Dao De Jing (道德經) and Zhuangzi (莊子) </a>and <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/parallel-lives-translations">Plutarch's Lives</a>. I took the notes and the lesson from those posts and placed them here.

<h2>notes on publishers</h2>
1. <strong>Penguin [Classics]</strong>
- good, simple book format (which is becomes more important when reading digitally): intro, then straight to content
- most often has (/ probably can afford and copyright) the best translation
- for prolific authors they to divide works by several books often with different translators, which would make word choices inconsistent, and reading a bit more cumbersome (again, doubly important for digital reading)
2. Oxford [World's Classics]
- similar [to Penguin], but in the case of Plutarch's Lives, failed by excluding content
<h3>Western</h3>
1. <strong>none</strong>
- if one doesn't like the Penguin edition, then some other random publisher may have a better publication (physical format, digital format, extra content) or translation (Hackett, Basic Books, Yale, Cambridge, etc.)
- if one wants complete works, again, some other random publisher may have it (ex. Modern Library for Aristotle and Plutarch's Lives, Hackett for Plato, Landmark for Ancient Greece historians, etc.)
*. Delphi Classics eBook
– made for digital! Translator is probably limited to those that are available for free, which could be crusty.
x. Harvard [Loeb Classical Library]
- avoid, billingual Greek and very literally translated English, made for anal academicians. Perhaps for ease of secondary translators?
<h3>Eastern</h3>
1. <strong>none</strong> – probably some random native translator who is capable of thinking like an ancient native person, such as Yutang Lin and Wing-tsit Chan for ancient Chinese philosophy
- <strong><em>A Source Book in Indian Philosophy</em> by Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, Charles A. Moore</strong> (Princeton)
- <strong><em>A Source Book in Chinese Philosophy</em> by Wing-tsit Chan (Rongjie Chen)</strong> (Princeton)
-- published after helping Watson with <em>Sources of Chinese Tradition</em> (Columbia)
- <strong><em>The Wisdom of China [and India]</em> by Yutang Lin</strong> (Random House, Modern Libary, picked it up)
-- he wrote a history of Chinese philosophy and even translates the Chinese sources, <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/translations-of-laozi-and-zhuangzi-a-translation-hell">which I thought were the best translations of Laozi <em>and</em> Zhuangzi</a>. For the India portion, I believe he writes the history, but selects translations of sources.
- <em>Readings in Classical Chinese Philosophy</em> by Ivanhoe and Norden (Hackett)
0.5 Columbia (Watson, Mair)
- seems like a niche monopoly here. Better than Penguin and Oxford for Laozi, and maybe Zhuangzi too (<strong>doesn't this show how insular and analytic (read: anal) Harvard and Oxford are? And on lesser level, how insular even Columbia is for not having more, smaller societies?</strong>)! Also has <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/the-kinds-of-literature-and-the-extraction-of-ideas">anthologies and "source books"</a> for literature <em>and everything else</em> respectively, which basically cover the entirety of a civilization's past:
- <strong><a href="http://cup.columbia.edu/series/introduction-to-asian-civilizations">Introduction to Asian Civilizations series</a></strong>: Titles beginning with "Sourcebook" are comprehensive, "<em>Encompassing social, intellectual, religious, and literary traditions</em>"; Titles with "Sources" is an "<em>abridged introductory collection [that] offers students and general readers primary readings in the social, intellectual, and religious traditions</em>". So, <strong>it seems that they are composed of <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/lessons-in-research-of-a-past-time">social, intellectual, and religious histories</a>. That's a huge feat. That makes this series, as far as the East goes, the most valuable source that I have found thus far.</strong>
-- <em>Sourcebook of Korean Civilization:</em> Volume One: From Early Times to the 16th Century by Peter H. Lee
-- <em>Sources of Korean Tradition:</em> Volume One: From Early Times Through the 16th Century by Peter H. Lee, Yôngho Ch'oe, Hugh H. W. Kang
- Victor A. Mair is the editor of <em>The Columbia History of Chinese Literature</em>, <em>The Shorter Columbia Anthology of Traditional Chinese Literature </em>, <em>Columbia Anthology of Chinese Folk and Popular Literature</em>, and a translator of at least Laozi, Zhuangzi, and Xunzi.
- Burton Watson is <em>the translator</em> of a ton of things all over East Asia (Hanfeizi, Xunzi, Mozi), and often a editor of the anthologies by Columbia, including one for Chinese poetry, <em>The Columbia Book of Chinese Poetry: From Early Times to the Thirteenth Century</em>, and one for Japanese poetry, <em>From the Country of Eight Islands: An Anthology of Japanese Poetry</em>.
*. Shambhala
- I ran into this publication for Laozi (3 good translations) and Zhuangzi, quite modern and good

<h2>a recent lesson</h2>
<blockquote><strong>The Oxford and Harvard editions are <em>"scholarly"</em>, which for us mortals translates to <em>less accessible</em>, which opposes one of the tenets of art, making them detrimental to life. Leave those insular schools and their [publishing] presses to their insular selves. For the future: simply get the Penguin edition, if not, jump into a crusty old translation, more convenient if it's within a <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/the-kinds-of-literature-and-the-extraction-of-ideas">reader or sourcebook</a>, if not, <em>do something else</em>.</strong>
<cite>Rahil, <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/translations-of-parallel-lives">Translations of Plutarch's Lives</a></cite>
