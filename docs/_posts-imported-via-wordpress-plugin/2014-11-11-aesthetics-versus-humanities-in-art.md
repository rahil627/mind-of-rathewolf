thoughts from Japan 
<blockquote>before 9/24/13:
I play some games that people spent years on in a few minutes and feel I am done with it, or have experienced it before.</blockquote>

While consuming art, I'd skim through products at lightning speed, not impressed by any because I experienced the aesthetic before, <a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/new-experience-ethics" title="New Experience Ethics">craving for something new.</a>

When an artist creates something there are two directions, which can be combined: to further aesthetics and to further humanities. Humanities contains knowledge that can educate. Aesthetics has a method of transmitting knowledge that can provide a better means to educate.
