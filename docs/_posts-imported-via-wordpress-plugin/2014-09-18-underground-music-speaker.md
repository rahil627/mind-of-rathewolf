Have a speaker in a public place above ground playing music live from a street musician underground. Also have a donation box.

<div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/underground-music.svg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2335" src="http://www.rahilpatel.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/underground-music.svg" alt="underground music" /></a></div>

Design:
Data input: sound from musician underground
Data output: sound through speaker overland

Idea:
Would people dance to a speaker? Would people donate without being able to prove? Would people donate to a speaker? Does the physical body of a musician matter?

Further design: Have speakers outside of an expensive concert play music live. Create a barrier and charge people at the entrance. Charge a fraction. Would people pay?
