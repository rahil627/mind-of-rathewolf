<blockquote>For the political economists, however, the natural soci-&nbsp;ety belonged not to the beginnings of history, but was emerging from the industrial revolutionâ€”capitalism.</blockquote>
&nbsp; - from The Revolutioary Ideas of Marx by Alex Callinicos.

This reminded me of an old idea, that anything political (and aesthetic?) must start from primitive societies, otherwise I feel the thought is useless because it doesn't encompass all societies, often limiting the thoughts to the authors own narrow worldview.
