<blockquote>Morning depression. It occurs when one does not get out of the house in the morning. Most people walk, jog, exercise, commute. I like to explore. Without satisfying this psychological need, one can become depressed, especially when living alone. Over-think what t odo or where to go. One should just go, get out of the house. Cities are nice as one does not have to walk far to encounter people [an experience]. Asia works well too, with its scooters. The suburbs can be troublesome, as there are few public spaces to go to.</p>
<p>As soon as I went outside the house, into the the light, I felt better. Light is important.</p>
<p>Local projects.</p>
<p>Today I wasted away. Not enough local interaction. The problem of being a lone independent gamer emerges: I crumb when I am working alone. It is the same problem encountered when Jon was here. We were deprived of friends. So we abounded the game idea and created a game workshop.</p>
<p>I do not think today was a waste. Itâ€™s progress. Thinking about what I want to do next.</p></blockquote>

<p>Experience and not experiencing.</p>
